I leave aside for the moment the obvious point that G, N and S do not exhaust the possible agendas of play (and immersion in particular has been described as an experiential agenda rather than a creative agenda).<br/><br/>I do not know why the writer conflates this so-called "incoherence" with a game being GM-led, even if many GM-led games are "incoherent" and vice-versa. There is no necessary connection between the two. The article is riddled with ideologically grounded assumptions and seems to miss the point about how GM-led, traditional games can, when done well, offer an experience that many (often passionate and/or cerebral) roleplayers prefer; sneering expressions such as "Mother May I" in relation to online, moderated narrative roleplay do not assist the writer's cause, especially since, from what I understand, those games generally have a very focused agenda (the writing of satisfying prose).<br/><br/>The writer is probably right to observe that a game that depends on one energetic and knowledgeable participant (who can shepherd the others if need be) has, in a way, a more surmountable buy-in requirement than a game that depends on EVERYONE being energetic and knowledgeable. Another feature of traditional, campaign-style games is that people can get to know characters and follow what are in a loose sense those characters' stories over time, plus with a campaign format not only are you hooked on the ongoing unfolding of events and eager to find out what happens next, but you also turn up each week ready to dive straight into play without having to relearn rules or setting details, as you are already familiar with them. So this style of play maximises playing time versus set-up time, in the medium-to-long term, meaning that you get a lot more bang for your buck in terms of playing hours enjoyed per \xa3 spent on the rules or per hour spent setting up the game (including negotiating what to play, learning the rules etc.). Whilst the rules can be criticised for their complexity, this complexity may be necessary... or at least helpful... in sustaining a varied campaign over the medium-to-long term, and in making it easy to differentiate between different characters and situations mechanically, so that they are not only described as different, but feel different to the more analytical players.<br/><br/>To my mind D&amp;D 5e can credibly be seen as a backpedalling from the (commercially speaking) excessively narrow, "coherent" focus of D&amp;D 4e, and that suggests to me that whilst the fight for "coherence" managed to attract the attention of the designers of THE big RPG, they have now understood that it is not commercially optimal.<br/><br/>Many of the people on this site will have a natural preference for "coherent" and "focused" games with a rapid build-up and efficient, narrowly focused resolution mechanisms, and for games that offer a compact exploration of themes with equally shared narrative contribution/participation, and that's absolutely grand. But if you think that a preference for that sort of experience is somehow more sophisticated or more mature or more rational than a preference for having a traditional GM or for campaign play with a slow build-up or for meandering rules choc-full of subsystems, you are absolutely kidding yourselves. What's more, that preference is not driven by some narcissistic need for "empowerment" (OK, I can't rule out the existence of the occasional narcissitic nutter GM, but broadly speaking):- there are all sorts of perfectly legitimate reasons for preferring a traditional game (even among people who are more than capable of playing and enjoying a more focused game in a way that contributes to satisfying play for all). This latter sort of game can also lead to a more thoughtful experience of play than the gonzo experience that "tighter" games with shared narrative authority sometimes (sometimes!) produce.<br/><br/>Designers have already solved the puzzle of how to give roleplay maximum breadth of appeal, and its name is (regrettably) World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft as I understand it (never played it) has both roleplay servers and questing servers to choose from. Like a broad-church RPG, it can cater to a variety of tastes. The commercially speaking most successful "indie" or supposedly "coherent" RPGs (PbtA, Fate, BW) all have GMs and lend themselves to campaign play (possible exception that proves the rule: Fiasco?), and my one experience of a PbtA game was that it felt very much like a trad game and not much like the "indie" games I had also played. Neither that game nor Mouse Guard seemed to me to offer any impressive advantages over trad games. I did very much enjoy a Star Wars hack of Duty and Honour, which maybe did offer something trad games don't (though I still prefer the very best experiences of trad play over my experience of that game), but, ya know, it had Jedi. ANYTHING can be good with Jedi. Unless it also has mentally defective animal-people with racist caricature accents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452279/#Comment_452279" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T03:52:24+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  3:52AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember when I said "predicting things will not change is always a safe bet" in January 2015?

Start by trying to imagine that maybe, just maybe, some/many trad gamers are getting something out of their trad gaming that "indie" gaming won't give them, or won't give them in the same way. Trad games and indie games are not identical (nor is AD&amp;D 2nd edition identical to AD&amp;D 1st edition; same principle). Therefore it is likely that each has advantages and disadvantages compared to the other, depending on what you are aiming for with your gaming experience.<br/><br/>Now, maybe you can't personally empathise with these trad gamers' preference or even understand even at a cognitive (rather than emotional) level what they like so much about their trad games, but at least accept it as an intellectually conceivable proposition that they may be getting something (even if you don't know what) out of trad games that "indie" games don't offer them. That is the first step to engaging with them.<br/><br/>Everything you regard as a "shortcoming" of a trad game, no matter how deeply or rigorously analysed, may be revealed as a "feature, not a bug" in the eyes of others with different preferences. One man's meat is another man's poison, etc. You do not "know" that something could be done "better" with "modern tools". What you may know is that something can be done in a way that better appeals to you, and better facilitates your personal gaming objectives, with techniques that happen to have first been used in this century rather than the previous one. Fair enough. But be careful of viewing your gaming objectives too broadly. Your playing objective is not "universal fun for everyone" or even "stories that would universally be regarded as the best". It is something far more specific than that - fun of the specific kind you like, in the specific way you like, or "stories" of the kind you like best. Maybe you want everyone to be involved in conscious creative input and you want your games to revolve around premise and theme. Maybe "indie" games do that best. But maybe other gamers want games that let them get to know their characters and feel what it's like to be their characters, and games that let them maintain the in-character experience over a long time, and in an in-depth way. Maybe, for many such gamers (though by no means all), "indie" games totally suck at producing that experience.<br/><br/>Also, it is so ideologically biased to be referring to "indie" game-design techniques as "modern tools" or "cutting edge" as if to say that trad design is either outdated or simply stagnant. Having a long pedigree does not make a methodology outdated. Moreover, people are constantly trying to write better trad games. Even D&amp;D 5e is an example of that. <br/><br/>You may be 100% right that for you personally there are few subjective attractions in going back to trad gaming now that you have tried "indie" gaming. But people's most fundamental preferences differ. And by no means all the people whose fundamental preference is for trad games have that preference because they want endless combat, or a massively detailed mechanical simulation of the game-world. Many people who play RPGs to engage in some way with the fiction, especially in character portrayal, character exploration and immersion, have a very thoughtful preference for trad games over "indie" games. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452306/#Comment_452306" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T17:45:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  5:45PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that a lot of people (myself included) are coming from a background of playing lots and lots of "trad" games in a very specific context:<br/><br/>1) There are a number of people playing the games because they have always played them, and don't know what else is out there.<br/><br/>2) Some of them are just happy to hang out or play whatever. The rest are more active in making the games work and searching for better play. They are constantly dissatisfied, because they're not getting exactly what they want.<br/><br/>3) At some point, different/more modern/progressive games are discovered. Whether individually or collectively, these games start providing tools to fix that dissatisfaction and improve the gaming.<br/><br/>Sometimes the quieter, non-so-committed players are lost in the switch (they preferred being able to play more "passively", in a trad style, and the indie games are too demanding for them), and only the highly motivated, vocal parties remain. This doesn't seem as a huge loss, perhaps, or even goes unnoticed (maybe those people just got bored of gaming, in general?).<br/><br/>In any case, after this experience, it seems like a no-brainer that the necessary step has been taken. Gaming has improved; why go back?<br/><br/>I find it interesting that, even though I know there are lots of people out there who *consciously* prefer trad gaming (in a deliberate way; not just from a limited mindset) because I encounter them on the internet, I don't think I've ever met those people in real life. (Or, when I have, their games were a mess - in that case, it's hard to tell what's really going on.) The one exception is the OSR crowd, who have their techniques and approaches which serve their gaming agenda.<br/><br/>I can see how someone coming from that perspective can't really imagine why the apparent majority of the gaming world is doing something they don't enjoy. Don't those people get it? They could go through the same transformation that I went through and have much more fun!<br/><br/>Now, from online discussions, we know that's not the case. We have people (as in this thread) who are very consciously choosing trad gaming styles, presumably because they enjoy that kind of gaming more.<br/><br/>But, somehow, there are a number of people who have gone through the experience I've described above. If you can imagine yourself going through that trajectory I've just described, hopefully you can see where the "rabid indie game zealot" attitude gets its wheels.

I am a very active player in any ordinary sense of the word, highly motivated and vocal. I frequently GM and design games. I prefer to play, but I do enjoy GMing very nearly as much. I often prefer to play just my character without author-style input into the wider world, and if you regard that as "passive" in some sense, then fine, but I am perfectly capable of playing with authorial input, and even when (as is usual for me) I focus on just my character, I play in what is really a very active way in the usual sense of that word (even if not "active" in "authorial activities", I am "active" in what you would think of as character-stance activities).<br/><br/>If it has been your experience and that of many others that only the quieter, not-so-committed players have been lost in the switch, fair enough, that is your anecdotal experience, but we have no rigorous empirical evidence on the subject.

Gaming has improved; why go back?</blockquote>\nFor you, subjectively, sure. Though I would also say that trad games can be done in a way that promotes things like immersion very well, or very badly. Mostly, they are probably done very badly. If you are interested in seeing what trad has to offer, it's worth trying a variety of trad stuff and you may find something that offers something different, that you haven't had (to the same extent) previously. You may still prefer "indie" games, but that doesn't make it not worth going looking. I regard anything strongly GM-led and without significant shared narrative authority as broadly speaking "trad" for these purposes, and it's definitely worth trying GM-led freeform games, as I've said elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452310/#Comment_452310" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T18:38:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  6:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2016 6:44PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can see how someone coming from that perspective can't really imagine why the apparent majority of the gaming world is doing something they don't enjoy.

The trouble is that it rubs people up the wrong way when it comes across as arrogance and dismissiveness towards what may be very carefully thought-out trad games.\n<blockquote>But, somehow, there are a number of people who have gone through the experience I've described above.

Indeed, the converse was true for me. I remember being shown the published rules of one particular and fairly well known "indie" game by (I think) the designer and naively asking him in all seriousness if it was a joke. That may have unwittingly offended him... And after I got a real analytical grip on the concept of immersion in character and how it works, it took a hell of a lot of naysayers to make me realise that not everyone would be looking to enjoy that style of gaming. I know that now, cognitively, but I still don't feel it in my bones, emotionally. RPGs and storygames are one sphere where understanding the extent of one man's meat being another's poison, and really taking that on board at an emotional rather than just an intellectual level, is exceptionally difficult. As someone coming at this more from the trad end, I've been to Indiecon about six times (albeit sometimes just to GM) and I've tried a range of indie games, so I've done my bit to broaden my horizons, but there's always more work to be done there. In the process of it, I discovered that I did have a better time with the Star Wars hack of Duty and Honour than with the majority of trad tabletop games I've played, but the games I've enjoyed the very most of all have still been trad. <br/><br/>In fact I have no problem admitting that I've played many utterly dire trad games, and I've enjoyed playing games like Mouseguard, Fiasco and Montsegur 1244 far more than those. (Mostly I'm thinking of D&amp;D 3e and derivatives.) Something I sometimes wonder is how many of the indie zealots with the pro-indie experience you describe upthread have only experienced trad games in what I would regard as a fairly dire form. I regard myself as a "fiction-oriented" gamer (maybe "fiction first"?), and it seems to me that that is something that some trad gamers have in common with "indie" gamers. But many "indie" gamers and indeed many trad gamers may have played reams and reams of "system-oriented" trad games without ever finding what in my eyes is a "decent" fiction-oriented trad game. So many "indie" gamers (by no means all) may possibly be tarring all trad games with the same brush based on a limited experience. Because great fiction-oriented trad gaming is hard to get right. It has taken me a long time to slowly improve my GMing style, for instance. Though, I would say, that it's possible to get great, fiction-oriented trad gaming even with a faulty underlying system.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452311/#Comment_452311" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T18:39:35+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  6:39PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I fear this might go deeper into the issue than I originally intended.

With that said I'll dare reply your slightly aggressive post.\n<blockquote><br/>In what sense do you consider that "coherent", "focused" games are games that are "done better" than trad games"? <br/></blockquote>\nI personally value games that have clear objectives and goals for both players and GMs. If these are clear to the designer, they can make a game that supports the intended way of playing 100%, no useless rules in sight. To me this is good game design. This is what "coherent" games do better than trad games, which are often notoriously full of different ways to interpret the game. <br/><br/>Many trad games are toolboxes in this sense, not actual games with singular objectives, and it's the GM who has to construct the actual playable game. If this is intentional, good! It's a valid way of designing game toolboxes, and many GMs enjoy jumping into  the game designer's shoes. But this is good game design only if it was the trad designer's original conscious intention and not just the way trad game design has been previously done.<br/><br/>When I want a game that doesn't have anything redundant dragging back the experience, and not a toolbox presumably designed to appeal to a larger audience, I find "coherent" games are done better than trad games.\n<blockquote><br/>Here is a challenge for your imagination. Start by trying to imagine that maybe, just maybe, some/many trad gamers are getting something out of their trad gaming that "indie" gaming won't give them, or won't give them in the same way. Trad games and indie games are not identical (nor is AD&amp;D 2nd edition identical to AD&amp;D 1st edition; same principle). Therefore it is likely that each has advantages and disadvantages compared to the other, depending on what you are aiming for with your gaming experience.<br/><br/>Now, maybe you can't personally empathise with these trad gamers' preference or even understand even at a cognitive (rather than emotional) level what they like so much about their trad games, but at least accept it as an intellectually conceivable proposition that they may be getting something (even if you don't know what) out of trad games that "indie" games don't offer them. That is the first step to engaging with them.<br/></blockquote>\nOh, I have no problems there. I see people enjoying trad games around me and I'd be a fool to deny that. That's why I wanted to analyze Ars Magica, to further understand where the trad fun is at.\n<blockquote><br/>Everything you regard as a "shortcoming" of a trad game, no matter how deeply or rigorously analysed, may be revealed as a "feature, not a bug" in the eyes of others with different preferences.

I try to find what this particular game's objective is, and then try to analyze whether or not the game system and/or text offers good tools to achieve that objective. This may not be the only way to analyze games from a neutral point of view, but I find it works well. From this neutral point of view I came to the conclusion that if Ars Magica 3ed had a clearer idea of what it wants to do, its objective, it could be made into a better game. Simply by dropping useless rules bloat, but also by employing modern tools such as explicit agendas and principles of play.<br/><br/>Now what needs to be cut depends on what objective is set when assembling the game from the toolbox. Perhaps crunchy character creation is a useful creative aid if you're into character immersion, but perhaps then you wouldn't need the tactical combat system. Or something. So yes, bugs may be features and vice versa, but we need a neutral context, the game's objective, before we can judge which are which.\n<blockquote><br/>Also, it is so ideologically biased to be referring to "indie" game-design techniques as "modern tools" or "cutting edge" as if to say that trad design is either outdated or simply stagnant.

It is nice to engage with someone who is clear and open in stating their views, so please do not take it personally.\n<blockquote>I personally value games that have clear objectives and goals for both players and GMs. If these are clear to the designer, they can make a game that supports the intended way of playing 100%, no useless rules in sight. ...

Rules you regard as "useless" other people might regard as serving a very useful function (whether as an integral component in a "coherent" system or as tools in a toolbox full of optional extras). \n<blockquote>Many trad games are toolboxes in this sense, not actual games with singular objectives, and it's the GM who has to construct the actual playable game. If this is intentional, good! It's a valid way of designing game toolboxes, and many GMs enjoy jumping into  the game designer's shoes.</blockquote>\nI think most games with a toolboxey feel in reality do the vast majority of the heavy lifting for the GM; the GM just has to make a few choices out of clearly presented options.\n<blockquote>But this is good game design only if it was the trad designer's original conscious intention and not just the way trad game design has been previously done.</blockquote>\nSurely what matters is what is presented in the published ruleset and present in the common consciousness of the game-community, not what the designer's private subjective intentions were? \n<blockquote>When I want a game that doesn't have anything redundant dragging back the experience, and not a toolbox presumably designed to appeal to a larger audience, I find "coherent" games are done better than trad games</blockquote>\nLet me rephrase that. If a game comes prepackaged with everything you need ready to run it straight out of the box, clearly it has an advantage over toolboxey games for prep-time for play. Likewise a toolboxey game has an advantage of flexibility for those with prep-time to spare. But a trad game can be highly prepackaged and un-toolboxey, and could PbtA be considered a toolboxey "indie" game with no clear single ruleset other than what can be inferred as general principles from AW?\n<blockquote>I see people enjoying trad games around me and I'd be a fool to deny that. That's why I wanted to analyze Ars Magica, to further understand where the trad fun is at.</blockquote>\nProbably the swiftest way to arrive at the most reliable answer is for you to find trad gamers who have rejected "indie" games (or who play both) and ask them why. If you want the best-analysed answers, you should ask cerebral and analytical trad gamers, but they won't be totally representative. Asking people what they enjoy about these games is easier and more reliable than trying to infer what they enjoy by reading the printed rules, or even by playing with them. \n<blockquote>When I'm analyzing a game, I don't think of my personal gaming objectives. I try to find what this particular game's objective is, and then try to analyze whether or not the game system and/or text offers good tools to achieve that objective. This may not be the only way to analyze games from a neutral point of view, but I find it works well. </blockquote>\nBut what if the game has multiple, confluent objectives? What if the game designer wants immersion AND mystery AND challenge AND horror, all at the same time? What if the gamer wants fast combat AND detailed social rules? What if the game designer wants to create an environment where people can follow the same characters from one situation to another, very different situation and yet another, very different again? What if part of the joy of the game, for the designer, is its sheer expansiveness and the variety of experience that it offers? The game designer and players may not WANT a single narrowly defined objective in the sense of "immersion" or "challenge" or "horror"; they might want a composite objective, say, the specific mix of those three.\n<blockquote>I wasn't trying to imply that trad techniques are outdated, it's just that "indie" games do most of the experimentation nowadays, hence they find most of the new viable techniques. These can be referred to as modern techniques. And indeed people are writing better trad games, but they too often use techniques invented by indie developers.</blockquote>\nI think you underestimate the amount of active design thought being done routinely by trad designers. Sometimes admittedly it may not be about overarching theories or radical concepts; it may be at a more finegrained level of detail in the mechanics. But for instance to help me design Soul's Calling I read books on Stanislavsky's acting theory to see if that could give me practical tools for heightening immersion. I found it did. How is that less experimental or innovative than what "indie" game designers are doing? Or what about the advantage/disadvantage rules in D&amp;D 5e for instance? Maybe that was inspired by something "indie", I don't know, but a lot of people love that mechanic. What I find is that some people discount all the design work "trad" people do because the games that come out of it still look like "trad" games, which tend to look more alike, admittedly, than many "indie" games do. But there can still be very significant innovation within the trad sphere.<br/><br/>Also, whatever your subjective intentions, when you use phrases such as "modern tools" and "cutting edge" regarding "indie" games, like it or not, it does imply (at least to me, probably to most readers) that trad design is outdated. Whether or not this is what you mean, you risk giving offence, so you might want to reconsider how you phrase it, and be more precise. "Recently invented design methods" would probably be fine. \n<blockquote>I do think there are good reasons to go trad in today's RPG landscape.

Just describing how a certain person's history with gaming might lead them to a lopsided view.<br/><br/>Personally, I accept and respect a well-considered preference for trad gaming. (And, like many other "indie gamers", the more I play various games the more confident I feel I could have a great deal of fun playing 'trad' games if I were with a group of people familiar with "modern" games, and fluent with a variety of gaming techniques. I think that's a common point of view!)<br/><br/>I would say that, of the gamers I know and have met:<br/><br/>* A large number play trad games, but haven't tried anything else.<br/>* An equally large number have played both, and prefer "indie" games.<br/>* A smaller number enjoy playing both equally. (There are a lot of these on Story Games...)<br/>* A very small number have only played indie games.<br/>* An incredibly small number (in fact, I can't think of one off the top of my head) have played both, but continue to prefer trad games. (Unless we count OSR enthusiasts, those are a small but sizeable contingent.)<br/><br/>My experience talking to other gamers (again, in my social circles) is that they have seen a similar breakdown.<br/><br/>So, from MY perspective, it seems like "indie games are taking over". They're gradually capturing old trad fans and making them into happier gamers! And, clearly, this is what my friends are seeing, too.<br/><br/>I only know from market statistics and from the internet that there are a bunch of hardcore "trad" gamers who don't find "indie games" (boy, what a broad brush...) offer them anything of great value.<br/><br/>That's one of the things that makes such discussions and threads really valuable, in fact: to become more aware of different opinions and experiences. I think the new thread on the virtues of trad games is fantastic, for example, and hope to see more contributions to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452331/#Comment_452331" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T04:11:01+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:11AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>I just find that many of these games could be even better if they were clearer in what they're trying to do instead of appealing to a maximally large audience or being toolboxes when an actual game would've made more sense.</blockquote>\nThis point of view more or less entirely depends on you thinking that you've correctly identified the game's objective, and that it's a neat, single objective rather than a composite objective, and that neat, single objectives are for some reason better than composite objectives, and that the game designer is right to have pure faith in his own ability to hone in on the exact experience he wants players to have, rather than giving the GM the flexibility to choose the rules that the GM thinks will work best for the particular group or the particular style of play.</blockquote>\nI find this to be a very interesting conundrum:<br/><br/>Is there a better way to explain and present more "flexible" or "toolboxy" games, in a way which makes the purpose of their different bits more clear?<br/><br/>Personally, I love seeing game texts which call out things like, "You might want to use this rule if you want more X in your game, but be aware that it might conflict with rule Z... generally speaking, groups which like staying in character during social conflicts might want to omit Chapter 5 entirely..."<br/><br/>Here's an area I would love to see more development happen.

Compare PbtA to D&amp;D 3rd ed. Forced to play one or the other, I (despite all my hardcore traddery, and other partisanship, and despite a general preference for relatively dense rules) would play PbtA in a heartbeat. Why? Because D&amp;D 3e is replete with stupid nonsense like pages of rules on when you can make an attack of opportunity, and requires a counterimmersive degree of focusing on the numbers, and has awful social conflict mechanics. Analytically, I can tell you why PbtA games are not strictly trad (players choose their "yes, but" outcomes in an authorial way, and the GM is rulebound). But in actual play, based admitted on only the one one-shot, the PbtA game I played felt like just about any old trad RPG with a rules-light system. And, you know, that's absolutely fine. So, basically, my prediction would be that rules-light trad systems will generally hold a broad appeal. However, in terms of commercial success, more complicated rulesets with better brand recognition will probably continue to dominate for the foreseeable future for all sorts of reasons. These include network externalities and the contribution that nuanced mechanical differentiation makes to fully satisfactory replayability, plus the fact that trad games only depend on one person (the GM) knowing the rules, so the buy-in for many members of the group is lower than it would be for "indie" games.<br/><br/>I fondly remember a player at Indiecon (Indiecon!) asking me whether a game I was going to be running required him to be "creative" because he felt he lacked the imagination to do so and therefore only felt confident playing just as his character without an authorial role. I believe he underestimated himself or maybe he was just trying to describe his preference with humility, but anyway, if such players can be found even at Indiecon, they can be found anywhere.<br/><br/>Indeed, my own pet project Soul's Calling allows people to participate as ref (GM), a-ref (assistant GM) or pure player. Of seven people other than myself who participated in the two home campaigns I ran in 2014-2015, only one was willing to be an a-ref with responsibilities going beyond what you may think of as "character stance".<br/><br/>My new hybrid "indie"/trad RPG Implodarc (as yet unplaytested as far as I know - any volunteers?) will be a very interesting experiment in this regard. In certain aspects of the game at least (including combat and a few other areas) it lets people choose as they go along whether to stay within a trad framework or in effect branch out into assistant GMing. It will be instructive to see how many people choose the narrative options, and how frequently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452366/#Comment_452366" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T14:39:27+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  2:39PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Omnifray,<br/><br/>No offense taken! Though you too might reconsider some phrasings if you want to avoid conveying harsh undertones.<br/><br/>There's definitely dangers in my analysis method. I might be biased by my preferences or I might simply miss the actual objective the game. This is one reason I wish explicit objectives were more widespread. <br/><br/>A game's objective doesn't have to be extremely focused for the game to be "coherent" though. I assume you're using "coherent game" to mean roughly "a game whose objective doesn't contradict itself", or in other words designed with a singular objective in mind. You could create a wide singular objective by combining, for example, immersion AND mystery AND challenge AND horror into one objective, as long as the components of the objective don't contradict each other. That one might not even be that wide.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, the larger you make the objective, the less you can support it. Your attention gets split too many ways. I think this is axiomatic, do you agree? The worst game ever is the one whose objective is to enable anything. During a single campaign there's only so much screen time available so you don't even need that wide an objective. Anything redundant to your campaign's needs is dragging the experience back, since the game could've focused entirely on the objective your campaign is playing for. This is why I'm skeptical of many trad games with wide objectives.<br/><br/>Singular objectives are definitely better than contradictory composite objectives. Whether wide objectives are worse than focused ones is, at least to some extent, a matter of taste and where to draw the line.\n<blockquote>Surely what matters is what is presented in the published ruleset and present in the common consciousness of the game-community, not what the designer's private subjective intentions were?</blockquote>\nIn the end that's what really matters, yeah. If we want to judge the designer's expertise, his intentions become relevant. If we want to judge the game itself then we should ignore the game community. But what really matters is the game experience which is of course influenced by the community.<br/><br/><br/>What are some of the well-regarded toolbox games that clearly present options of which the GM should choose, other than GURPS? ArM3 has two clearly presented combat systems to choose from, but that's about it if you don't count the different character creation methods. I'd be interested to delve further into these kinds of games.<br/><br/>For what it's worth I think the PbtA framework is something like a design platform while AW itself is a highly prepackaged game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452371/#Comment_452371" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T15:54:45+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  3:54PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A game's objective doesn't have to be extremely focused for the game to be "coherent" though.

I know that the Story-Games forum prefers to avoid entanglement in Forge-derived definitions (which can be a barrier to entry to discussion), but in this instance the definition is in fact linked to in the article linked to in the OP so it's clear what the writer meant and what I'm therefore responding to and commenting on. I may have impliedly expanded the definition of "coherent" (to avoid a strawman effect) to include any game that focuses narrowly on a narrowly defined, single agenda such as "immersion" or "mystery" even if it is not one of the three "creative agendas" recognised by GNS or "The Big Model".<br/><br/>I will add that I have put "coherent" in sneer quotes because I think it is frankly offensive to describe games that do not fit this narrow definition as thereby "incoherent". \n<blockquote>The thing is, though, the larger you make the objective, the less you can support it. Your attention gets split too many ways. I think this is axiomatic, do you agree?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely not. If you have a composite objective, then you may be supporting some aspect of it at some times and other aspects at other times but you are always supporting <b>some</b> aspect of it.\n<blockquote>The worst game ever is the one whose objective is to enable anything.</blockquote>\nI fundamentally disagree. Some people want the game to provide them with an arena for them to explore in a sandboxy way, without constraints, and personally I do value that level of flexibility. Of course the game won't provide specific rules for ABSOLUTELY everything (latrine visits forex).\n<blockquote>Singular objectives are definitely better than contradictory composite objectives. Whether wide objectives are worse than focused ones is, at least to some extent, a matter of taste and where to draw the line.</blockquote>\nIf the objective is a composite objective then parts of it may be in tension with each other but that does not make it a "bad" objective. How can an "objective" be "bad" other than subjectively? An "objective" is a statement of your core hopes for the game, based on what will make you enjoy it. If that includes aspects that are in tension with each other then (1) that may be simply a reflection of your most fundamental gaming preferences - judging those as inferior to someone else's is just silly and (2) the supposedly contradictory composite objective can be reinterpreted as the composite objective of combining those two "contradictory" elements in a balanced way to your satisfaction.\n<blockquote>What are some of the well-regarded toolbox games that clearly present options of which the GM should choose, other than GURPS</blockquote>\nWell, Burning Wheel allows different options for resolving the same situation (not all fights are necessarily resolved with "Fight!" if I recall correctly). So is Burning Wheel a "toolbox" game?<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure D&amp;D in many of its iterations if not all has consistently offered the GM various options as to how to apply the rules, and I've generally found them to be clearly presented. If that "clear presentation" did not include express explanation of the reasons for preferring one or the other option in order to realise different game objectives, that may be because the designers trusted the GM to make the call as needed, or thought that the reasons for preferring one approach or the other in different situations would be obvious, or would come down to subjective taste. Really, I think what you regard as a problem, is not regarded as a problem at all by others, who have used and enjoyed using those systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452373/#Comment_452373" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T16:00:16+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:00PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And come to think of it, it springs to mind that in the DMG for AD&amp;D 1st ed there is for example some explanatory text to help the DM decide which dice-rolling method to use for character generation, out of various options such as "4d6 drop the lowest, place as desired" or "3d6 six times, place strictly in order".

The first is the incremental approach, staying true to the tried and tested, but slowly and steadily improving by trial and error. The second is to step back and look at things from a theoretical perspective, taking a broad, abstract point of view and trying to formulate a theory. The second approach (as per the Forge) can result in very sweeping, very fast changes, whereas the first approach tends to result in limited but safer progress. The thing to recognise is that the second approach is not only on the whole faster (an advantage) but also on the whole riskier (a disadvantage). Since the projectile is released with such force, a small error in the positioning of the sights can result in a grotesquely erroneous trajectory. There is the danger of slinging the baby out with the bathwater. It is all well and good to develop overarching theories of how RPGs and storygames work, but human nature being complex and human intellect fallible, these theories are almost inevitably going to be imperfect in some way, so taking them too seriously (rather than treating them as a potential rule-of-thumb needing to be checked against the experience on the ground) can result in going way off course. The ultimate example of this is possibly the way that "The Big Model" fails to understand or account for the attractions of any of "simulationism", immersion or "incoherent" gaming adequately.<br/><br/>But even if by and large one would expect to find trad games developing more along the lines of the first approach and "indie" games developing more along the lines of the second approach, that is itself an overgeneralisation. Many trad games have introduced quite remarkable changes in the way the hobby works, and have involved re-imagining the hobby (dare I say re-imagineering it?) from the ground up - Amber Diceless being a case in point, or the questionable metaplot/railroading habit apparently ascribed to White Wolf games potentially being another (though that never really seemed to intrude upon my long experience of heartily and immersively enjoying V:tR MET-LARP). Likewise, many indie games have stuck to what is now a tried and tested pattern, the development of PbtA games from AW being the most notable example of this. Also, Sorcerer itself, by reputation (I have not played it), includes many elements borrowed from trad RPGs (so there was an element of the first approach there, i.e. trial and error).<br/><br/>I like theorising. I like attempts to impose abstract structure on human reality. But much in the same way that religious believers should always check the ultimate logical consequences of their belief system against the basic impulses of the human spirit (otherwise they risk becoming extremists and forgetting the basics of what it means to be human), in the same way you always have to take any form of theorising about RPGs with a pinch of salt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452394/#Comment_452394" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T18:14:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  6:14PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            omnifray,<br/><br/>I agree with the above. Although, in gaming, we have an advantage: we do not need to discard previous efforts to make new ones. In that sense, there is very little "risk". (It's not like taking apart our submarine to build a new one, and risking not having one at all if the new plan doesn't pan out...)<br/><br/>We can (and most of us do) play old and new designs, alike.<br/><br/>As for your notes on the Big Model, however, I might be careful with that. I think you'd likely find that most adherents of the Big Model would disagree with your statements above (bottom of the first paragraph). I think we should keep that discussion out of this thread, but if you wish to discuss, feel free to start a new one.

"Incoherent" in common parlance means "nonsensical" or some such, but Edwards was using it in the way it's used in physics: "coherent light" (light waves all in phase with each other and at the same frequency, like a laser) and "incoherent light" (full-spectrum light, like natural sunlight). <br/><br/>You can see how these terms make sense in the context of this discussion (multiple objectives vs. a "focused" game which does not stray from that topic).<br/><br/>It might have been a terrible idea to use these terms, since "incoherent" can sound like a pejorative. I wouldn't argue with that, and, for consciously Forgite games, like the term "CA-focused" as a substitute.<br/><br/>* I think the fundamental disagreement here is about the level at which a game "focuses" its attention (and, more importantly, the group in an actual play situation). <br/><br/>Either "multiple, contradictory objectives" are possible and desirable (e.g. omnifray's statement that trad games "cover all the bases, except maybe using the latrine"), and therefore a game can have breadth, or every game has a certain set of objectives and modes of play, and therefore all games are equally limited.<br/><br/>The "trad gamer's" point of view is that a less focused game allows her to do more different things, and is therefore more fun. There are no limits!<br/><br/>The Forgite view is that this is an illusion: games can *claim* all they want that "you can do anything", but, in reality, each game has a certain flow to it and supports certain styles of play and not others. <br/><br/>In the Forgite view, this is the very reason we *can* talk about "trad games" as an entity in the first place - many/most of them are structurally and procedurally identical. <br/><br/>This hypothetical Forgite gamer does not agree that a game like D&amp;D "supports" things like political drama, love triangles, emotional torment, struggles of faith, historical recreation, military "simulation", or whatever else you want to talk about. <br/><br/>The "trad gamer" seems to sometimes make the argument that it does. Does that describe your position on this as well, omnifray?<br/><br/>* Ultimately, I suspect this has more to do with marketing and presentation than it does with design. I've often heard that, say, D&amp;D is less "focused" than Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>Certainly it's presented that way. "You can do anything you can imagine!", says D&amp;D. Whereas Dogs says, "you're a teenage virgin with a gun - and here's how you construct Towns full of Sins".<br/><br/>It makes sense that the first might be a strong market force: certainly, unless I knew otherwise, the D&amp;D model would sound far more appealing and flexible. Dogs sounds very constrained and limited, so that I can only continue to reproduce the same kind of play over and over again.<br/><br/>However, as a gamer, I've never understood this point of view. Once we look past presentation and marketing, is the difference really that stark? I don't see it.<br/><br/>- I can play D&amp;D and decide to focus on political drama for a while. We put aside the dice and ignore a good deal of rules, and we do that! Yeay!<br/><br/>- Is there some reason I couldn't be playing a Dogs game, and similarly put aside the dice for a while and do some political drama?<br/><br/>I think indie gamers wouldn't do the latter, because they would rather reach for a more specialized game that does this well... but, if they didn't know such games existed, what would be stopping them?<br/><br/>I find there are a lot of assumptions being made by both camps which may not necessarily flow from design choices. If anything, a lot of indie games are far *more* flexible than a typical trad game. (Consider for a minute, just for example's sake, how much choosing classes in D&amp;D or Vampire clans in Vampire constrain your ability to play different kinds of characters and scenarios! So is it really the "flexibility" of these games that makes them so popular?)<br/><br/>I think marketing, play culture preferences, and unexamined assumptions loom large here. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452405/#Comment_452405" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T20:11:23+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  8:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 8:19PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The "trad gamer's" point of view ... omnifray?</blockquote>\nFirst of all I think that what Forgites might regard as a mechanic "supporting" political drama, love triangles, emotional torment or struggles of faith is likely to be a mechanic that I would regard as <b>impeding</b> those things (or rather, impeding what I enjoy about those things, which is engaging with them in an immersive way). "Social combat" mechanics are a complete turn-off for me. Even D&amp;D 3e's approach to Bluff checks, for instance, is a complete turn-off for me. In the vast, vast majority of cases, mechanics I have encountered for social situations have been inferior to freeform in terms of my enjoyment. My chosen social mechanics in Soul's Calling and Implodarc are an exception, but they are a very rare case, indeed, I think, unprecedented.<br/><br/>Secondly, D&amp;D covers a multitude of sins. Let's hone in on a particular edition:- BECMI D&amp;D, or maybe AD&amp;D 1e or 2e. These editions of D&amp;D do very little to regulate, mechanically, political drama or struggles of faith, and far less to regulate love triangles or emotional torment. There are alignment rules and maybe reaction tables for NPCs, but there are no tedious Bluff skill-checks. As such, D&amp;D in these early iterations <b>facilitates</b> political drama, love triangles, emotional torment, struggles of faith etc., only by giving people a context in which to engage with those things in a freeform way. But that manner of facilitating those things may, in fact, be the best way of doing so (subjectively, from the point of view of a particular player's enjoyment). It may be far superior to a more rules-based approach.<br/><br/>Switch the focus to D&amp;D 3e with its tedious Bluff checks. Those "support" political drama in spades, but OMG, only by snuffing out the very joy of playing out the political drama in an immersive way. Exactly like "social combat" rules, though to a lesser extent because even D&amp;D 3e's tedious Bluff checks are less intrusive than that. (Bear in mind please that I am expressing my subjective preferences here, not absolute truths.)<br/><br/>So I find it infuriating to be told by Forgites that games do not "support" political drama because they allow political drama to be played out freeform. In my view, the sort of "support" that Forgites envision actually kills the political drama aspect of the game for me. Really, really, kills it. What you end up with may be a mechanical simulation focused on political drama, or a game of negotiating stakes and choosing priorities revolving around political drama, but it is not a game of immersively engaging with political drama from an in-character point of view. The assertion that a game does not "support" political drama because it has no rules for it other than rule zero, tells me immediately that the person concerned has narrow preconceptions about how gaming can work and what can be enjoyable about it, preconceptions I reject.<br/><br/>Similar reasoning applies <b>with even greater force</b> to things like love triangles, emotional torment and struggles of faith. To my tastes, these <b>must</b> be the province of the player's immersive experience. (I have not always understood this preference of mine clearly, but now I do.) To allow rules to intrude on the ordinary functioning of a player character's rational mind kills the player's character immersion, the player's ability to conceive of his own thoughts as in themselves representing the character's thoughts. (Whilst I phrase this in general terms, to be pedantic I ought to add the caveat that everyone's experience of immersion is personal, and I am only talking about common trends, not about universal truths applicable even to all immersively inclined gamers.)<br/><br/>To me, therefore, OD&amp;D supports love triangles, emotional torment and struggles of faith far better than some Forgite game does that has explicit mechanics for them, because the mechanics (such as Beliefs in Burning Wheel) only get in the way and impede the fun. From the point of view of my subjective fun (I do not mean as a universal absolute truth), the mechanics are misconceived and stupid, because they prompt me to think in a metagamey way about the cost-benefit analysis arising from the Belief mechanics, rather than thinking in an immersive, in-character way. To be strictly fair, I have not played Burning Wheel and am only using it as an analogy. But I have played Vampire: the Requiem (MET-LARP), which has rules on Willpower based on your vices and virtues, and I can safely say that throughout long years of playing that game we pretty much disregarded those rules, I certainly paid almost no heed to them, they added nothing to my enjoyment of the game, at most they distracted me from actually playing my character, and they were a waste of time. We also disregarded the social resolution mechanics of MET-LARP (a controversial decision that I supported).<br/><br/>A trad RPG by rule zero and GM discretion <b>permits</b> you to do anything, and gives you a <b>context</b> in which your character's actions can have meaning:- your character's very existence in a wider game-world treated by the GM and players as a real construct. That, in itself, represents <b>light-touch support facilitating all aspects</b> of roleplay. Heavy-handed support is not required.<br/><br/>The importance of your freedom to do <b>absolutely anything</b> is then that it mirrors your real-life freedom to do absolutely anything and thus makes the game-world seem like a credible and real place and makes your character seem like a credible and real person within the game-world. Your absolute freedom to explore the game-world without constraint of theme or premise or (at the rare extreme of "indie" games) pre-envisioned storylines (Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne; Montsegur 1244) lends your character and the game-world a feeling of <b>substance</b>. If in contrast you play a game where you know that for "story" reasons or due to rules limitations your character's options are much narrower than they would be if your character were a real person, then that can make the game-world feel very artificial and unsatisfying or at least restrictive. <br/><br/>In the result, the Forgite notion that RPGs only support the sorts of play that they have specific procedures for betrays an absolute failure to understand the core appeal of trad RPGs:- that you can think of your character as a <b>real individual</b>. The fact that many "indie" gamers may think of their characters as real individuals and may not be impeded in this by typical features of "indie" games is beside the point; this is a personal subjective experience, and the key thing is that as a common trend, trad gamers like the way that the freedom to do anything resembles reality. In case I have concentrated too much on the perspective of immersionist or "simulationist" traddies, I should add that wargamers also often love the tactical freedom arising from being able to try absolutely anything. That attraction of tactical freedom, indeed, is probably what allowed roleplay to develop within Braunstein and gave birth to the RPG phenomenon in the first place. Because being able to make tactical decisions in the same way that you would if you were really your character, or at least with the same flexibility and range and familiarity of options that you can infer by analogy to real life, may be far more satisfying than messing about with abstract system-mechanics and probabilities for tactical reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452406/#Comment_452406" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T20:19:31+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  8:19PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            omnifray,<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of your last post. On the one hand, you seem to grasp the issue firmly in hand, and, at the same time, you seem to be making some bizarre assumptions.<br/><br/>For instance, you speak of how some early versions of D&amp;D included all kinds of random tables and similar material to use for political drama. Then you speak of your experiences playing something like Montsegur.<br/><br/>And... after that, somehow you come back saying that Bluff checks are good support for political drama, and that "indie" designers miss the point by trying to make political machinations or love triangles into "messing about with probabilities for tactical reasons".<br/><br/>Those are two very different stances! Contradictory ones, in my eyes.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoy the former, but rarely the latter.<br/><br/>In either case, though, saying that a game is great for X (e.g. political drama) because it doesn't provide any mechanics for that does nothing to explain why you wouldn't prefer to play some other game (including many "indie games") which ALSO doesn't provide any mechanics for that very same thing.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452412/#Comment_452412" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T20:49:07+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  8:49PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 8:56PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh? I think you have <b>completely misunderstood my post</b>. You seem unable to look beyond what I infer is your fundamental assumption that a game cannot support an element of play without procedures specific to that element of play. By interpreting what I wrote in the light of what I infer is your assumption, you are reading my post as if I had, multiple times, said the opposite of what I in fact said. I am saying that in many instances procedures designed to support an element of play in fact ruin it instead of supporting it. <br/><br/>My position is that early D&amp;D had very little by way of rules relevant to political drama, but my position is that that is positively a good thing for playing out political drama, because it can thrive in a freeform roleplay environment.<br/><br/>My position is that D&amp;D 3e has more (though still not as much as some "indie" games) by way of rules regulating political drama, and that those rules are unhelpful to the enjoyment of the very aspect of the game that they purport to support. They do the opposite of what they intend to do. They in fact make political drama less satisfying, instead of more satisfying. The game would be better off without those rules, just replacing them with rule zero and a freeform approach.<br/><br/>In that respect, my criticism of (some) "indie" games (example: Burning Wheel) is exactly the same as my criticism of D&amp;D 3e, namely that both of them have unnecessarily intrusive rules for social situations. (Other "indie" games such as Fiasco or Montsegur 1244 are far better in this respect, better than D&amp;D 3e that is, though I think not as good as early D&amp;D's freeform approach.)<br/><br/>My comments about messing with probabilities for tactical reasons were not directed at social mechanics in "indie" games (whether they would apply with equal force in that arena is another question entirely). They related to the entirely separate point that wargamers may well often find that the tactical freedom that rule zero gives them allows a better tactical experience than they would get, for instance, by thinking long and hard about how best to exploit rules on attacks of opportunity in D&amp;D 3e, or even rules on speed factors and weapon damage in AD&amp;D 1e, or the ridiculous rules that I doubt very many people actually ever used or understood on different to-hit modifiers against different armour classes.<br/><br/>As to your final point, actually I think the answer is there in my previous post and you have not fully understood it. What I enjoy about playing out political drama in, say, a salon LARP (with GMs and without using rules for social interaction) is a combination of (1) the fact that we can just get on with the roleplay in a freeform way and (2) the fact that the broader game creates a believable game-world that seems to have substance as a real place <b>thus giving context and meaningfulness to the twists and turns of the political drama as they emerge from the freeform roleplay</b>. Now, compare Montsegur 1244. Broadly speaking it allows us to roleplay in a freeform way, which is excellent. In many ways the game-world is very believable too. Where, therefore, does Montsegur 1244 fall down for political drama? In several ways. Firstly, the pre-envisioned storyline means that for artificial reasons extraneous to and in tension with the natural flow of the fiction, our in-character choices can only have limited consequences, and only an artificially restricted range of roleplay options is available to us. We cannot, for instance, have a genuine debate about conversion to Catholicism in-character, without knowing out-of-character that that debate cannot possibly lead to the conversion of all four main characters to Catholicism, as the rules and structure of the game only allow one to convert. We cannot try to influence the tactical defence of the city without knowing, out-of-character, that the city WILL fall to the Catholics, no matter how great our tactics, because history and the rules so dictate.  Secondly, on a closely related note, these artificial limits placed on our choices are an intrusive reminder that the character is a fictional element in a "story" or storygame, and not a real person, and that the game-world is a fictional setting and not a real place, no matter how believably the details of it may be painted, and no matter how historically accurate it may be. Thirdly, the character-switching is jarring from an immersive point of view (but many players may not be bothered about that, even many traddies). <br/><br/>However, despite all these points, Montsegur 1244 does allow immersive roleplay to a degree, and some people may find that for them personally it provides a superior experience in terms purely of character immersion than they get from early D&amp;D. In fact, most people may find that, depending on exactly how the particular game of early D&amp;D is run. If it is literally run as a dungeon-crawl full of murderhobos on a hack-n-slash bender killing things and grabbing their stuff, and is played by the numbers, then the particular D&amp;D game will be less immersive, and less use for political drama and love triangles and emotional interaction, than the Montsegur 1244 game. The psychological pain of character-switching and the frustration of knowing the "story" outcome in advance might still put me off playing Montsegur 1244 but if I did play it there would be aspects I would enjoy more than in that dungeon-crawl. But the shortcomings of that dungeon-crawl would be a function of the particular gaming group's approach and especially the DM's approach, not a criticism of D&amp;D itself. By permitting the gaming group the freedom to soar, early D&amp;D also exposes the gaming group to the risk of falling.<br/><br/>So basically, early D&amp;D <b>facilitates</b> an almost perfect gaming experience in the sense of providing a context in which it can take place and giving the DM and players the basic tools needed to make it happen, but for the realisation of that dream you do very much depend on having a competent DM and competent players. What this means in Forge terms is that the "game" that you are playing when you play D&amp;D is not just the game as written in the rulebooks but the game as learnt from practice and from the wider community. The rulebooks are in a sense not exhaustive of the "system" which is not fully codified there. And that's all fair enough, but it's very theoretical. In practical terms, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, and if you teach him to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. If you give a man early D&amp;D and show him how to use it, you give him all the tools he ever really vitally needs for a great roleplay experience (even if some more recent games including especially my own may be better from my personal subjective point of view). And an imaginative, intelligent man (or woman, or child) may be able to infer the missing elements from reading the rulebooks and using them in play. But as I've said elsewhere for me personally it took a lot of time, practice, observation of other games, reading up on different ideas of how to run games, and trial and (frequently) error before I arrived at the full set of techniques I am now more or less happy with, and I look back on some of my earlier efforts with dismay at how gauche they were!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452413/#Comment_452413" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T20:57:38+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  8:57PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 9:04PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it all depends on what you think of the work involved in learning to fish!

If I'm playing with a great DM, there may be moments where they feel obligated to engage the system when I'd rather they just arbitrate themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452416/#Comment_452416" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T21:20:06+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  9:20PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree; freeform trad tabletop RP can be sublime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452417/#Comment_452417" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T21:29:51+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  9:29PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            omnifray,<br/><br/>You are making some assumptions about how I'm reading your posts that are, unfortunately, not correct. Let me see if I can clarify (and I apologize if I'm not being clear; I don't have time for a full essay at the moment).<br/><br/>For instance, a LARP as you describe *does* support political drama, with pretty much the entirety of its design. You have factions, conflicting interests, presumably things to fight or haggle over (a hierarchy of power, scarce resources), and developed character personas which lend richness to all of that.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, you understand this, but yet you seem to be making the argument that I want a hypothetical great "political drama" game to be all Bluff checks and looking up modifiers. I've never said such a thing, and it sounds absolutely horrible. \n<blockquote><br/>My position is that D&amp;D 3e has more (though still not as much as some "indie" games) by way of rules regulating political drama, and that those rules are unhelpful to the enjoyment of the very aspect of the game that they purport to support. They do the opposite of what they intend to do. They in fact make political drama less satisfying, instead of more satisfying.</blockquote>\nThat is precisely my point, as well. I do not consider D&amp;D3E to "support" political drama, at least not very functionally, and I would never use it for that purpose. The example LARP supports political drama far more effectively.<br/><br/>Montsegur is supposed to "support" experiencing the moral struggles of someone dealing with a choice between burning and conversion, which it seems to do very well.<br/><br/>David gets at this in his short post: when you're playing D&amp;D, it's the GM's skills and experience which are "supporting" your hypothetical political drama. Those are the true mechanics and procedures being put to work, not D&amp;D's rules. For instance, the GM might be doing things like a) organizing a political milieu, with complex interdependent parts, b) populating it with colourful characters with polarized views and complex shared histories, and then c) doing a good job of communicating to the players how their characters can get involved, and d) adjudicating the outcomes of their actions using a - however unofficial or unwritten - system to turn all that into an exciting game.<br/><br/>Sometimes these discussions feel a little like the debates surrounding religion: the atheist claims that good and bad both exist, depending on circumstance, whereas the theist likes to see any possible good as coming from God, and any evil as an outcome of human choice.<br/><br/>In the same way, when a D&amp;D group ignores 99% of the rules in the D&amp;D book to play out an exciting political drama, you use that as an argument to support the virtue of D&amp;D's rules. Fiasco, you say, doesn't support political drama in the same way, and that's a failing of its rules, just the same. What if a group took Fiasco, removed or ignored 90% of the rules, and had an amazing time playing a long-form political drama? (I could even see that being done with relatively few changes. Let's take out the Aftermath, for instance, and we get a long-form campaign game...*) <br/><br/>In my view, both have found a way to support their sought-for playstyle. They have developed tools and techniques to make political drama really fun for their group. Great!<br/><br/>Now, perhaps D&amp;D encourages this more, by saying "you can do anything you want!", as I was alluding to above, whereas (say) Fiasco does not: it presents a single, clear way to play.<br/><br/>From where I'm sitting, though, this is marketing and not design. I could make a strong case for how Fiasco is better-suited (and provides better support) for political drama than D&amp;D (especially modern versions of D&amp;D!), and I don't see any terribly strong arguments to the contrary. Both games are designed with something else in mind; both can be modified by a group of really competent and skilled players to have fun in another mode. Why? Because both leave the political drama entirely to us. To see that as virtue in one game but as a flaw in another is much like seeing God's hand in the miraculous survival of a child after an earthquake while remaining silent on the issue of whether God could be said to have *caused* the earthquake in the first place.<br/><br/>As you said yourself, it shouldn't be that hard to design a game which does this far better than D&amp;D. (And the LARP you mentioned is a good candidate, leaving aside possible future designs like your own.)<br/><br/><br/>*: For comparison, I really doubt the political drama D&amp;D game is making use of the Weapon Type vs. AC chart you mentioned earlier...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452418/#Comment_452418" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T21:31:00+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  9:31PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 9:35PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, precisely.

(If that ship has not already sailed long ago.) We may not be disagreeing over much.<br/><br/>But to my mind the D&amp;D-qua-political-drama players really ARE using the D&amp;D combat rules, even if they never actually use them directly to determine the outcome of combat. Why? Because the option for combat is always there, facilitated by the existence of the combat rules. This adds a particular angle to the political debates you have:- you could always accept that you have lost the political debate, go nuclear and stab your (fictional) opponents. Your opponents could do the same. So could the mob of peasants at the door. This colours how you approach what you say.<br/><br/>For instance, who can say, hand on heart, that they would never be more polite to an angry-looking 6'4", 250lb ex-SAS trooper than they might be to a 5'4", 120lb accountant in the same situation?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452428/#Comment_452428" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T23:35:28+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:35PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think you'll find that your preferences are not that uncommon, even here (ha!).

Many gamers get used to certain techniques and then can immerse while using them more easily than they can with anything new.<br/><br/>2) The <i>necessary</i> abstraction of physical actions vs the <i>optional</i> abstraction of verbal ones.  I cannot resolve my character's orc-stabbing with an actual sword thrust, but I <i>can</i> resolve my character's orc-placating with actual words.  And If I <i>can</i>, then maybe it's immersion-friendlier to do it that way.<br/><br/>I do agree with you that description-based combat would be nicely compatible with an immersion priority.  I just think the group would need to internalize a lot of dialogue techniques to safeguard against the wrong kind of ignorance.  "I don't know why the guard didn't take my bribe" is way more acceptable than "I don't know why I just died."  The GM needs to be really consistent with the right feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452512/#Comment_452512" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T19:32:11+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  7:32PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As usual, Dave nails it on the "immersion" front.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452513/#Comment_452513" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T19:32:49+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  7:32PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm ready for a calisthenics-based combat system in which we resolve my orc-stabbing with exercise                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452515/#Comment_452515" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T19:38:42+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  7:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "To kill this Orc, you must perform 50 pushups and throw this ball through the hoop.

If you have an external audience observing the proceedings, and that is the point of doing it, then it's theater; if there is no external audience, or they are incidental to the motivation of playing, it's a LARP.<br/><br/>This does of course mean that it is possible to write up a thing where it is entirely impossible to determine its LARP/theater nature without asking the players whether they are performing for themselves, each other, or the audience.

To me it seems pretty clear that they're simply larpers who happen to perform in the medium of roleplaying without partaking in the historical cultural roots of Gygaxian gaming. (By "Gygaxian gaming" I mean this entire hobby rooted in D&amp;D. It is a separate thing from "roleplaying" as a medium, although the two massively overlap. It's sort of like the difference between "theology" and "Christian theology" in that the latter is the big dog in the field, but it is possible to have theology without it having Christian roots.)<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that I do not intend to belittle anybody by characterizing audience-less improv as being identical to larping. It's just that I don't see any technical difference, merely the difference in the cultural roots. If the exact same thing was being done by somebody with elf ears, who got the idea by reading a rpg 'zine, it would be called "larping".<br/><br/>Also, not saying that cultural context and history are not important - of course they are. It's just that if we're asking for the technical divide between larping and improv, of course the answer we are looking for is somehow analytical regarding the activity itself. The answer that "it's larping when its influences come from rpgs and improv when its influences come from the theater world" is pretty obvious, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452566/#Comment_452566" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T19:59:53+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  7:59PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Eero. It sounds like we're saying the same thing: at a fundamental level, you can't really draw a line. An audience is a good thing to consider, but I'm sure there are, say, reenactments of medieval battles by LARPers which attract an audience - not to mention that recording an Actual Play of your game and then posting it online (say, as a video) makes into theatre by that definition!<br/><br/>I do think that there are other features, but none are definitive.<br/><br/>For instance, in my experience, most improv theatre is (or leans towards) comedy, with getting some laughs being a high priority. Gamers might be more interested in coherent storylines and consistent characters, on the other hand. Certainly those don't distinguish one from the other categorically, but they could be a useful "clue" to, say, an alien studying human pastimes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452576/#Comment_452576" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T21:11:37+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  9:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would agree with the idea that drawing a line is somewhat arbitrary. I do also happen to subscribe to a school of rpg theory that <i>is</i> capable of drawing the line very clearly, so I'll have to stand on that for myself, even as others are free to view the matter differently <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>For instance, a LARP that just happens to have an audience is still a LARP because it is not being played for that audience, but for the sake of the participant experience. I think that this is theoretically entirely straightforward, even if ascertaining the matter one way or another may be difficult in practice (e.g. because the players might lie or be mistaken when self-reporting). Usually it is not: when my re-enactor friends are e.g. hired to perform gladiator combat at some local museum, it's pretty clear that it's not a roleplaying game of any sort, but rather a theatrical event. Likewise, when a tv crew comes to one of their larps to get some material for a newscast or whatever, the players do not generally cease playing and start performing for the camera.<br/><br/>Similarly, a recording of a played game does not make that game into theater until the point where the recording becomes the purpose of play. Our S/lay w/ Me blog game is actually a pretty good example of hewing close to the line: if we had more readers, it's not that difficult to see how the project might cease to be a rpg and become a serial novel instead; all it would take would be for us to start viewing the rules and interaction of the game as serving the purpose of the audience, rather than serving the purpose of entertaining us, the players.<br/><br/>There are other activities that can be defined against theater in similar ways. Religion, for example, could be viewed in this light: a religious rite is itself until the point where it starts to exist as a performance for an audience. This distinction seems pretty handy for determining whether e.g. the martial practices of a Shaolin temple bogged with tourists are religious or theatrical in nature.<br/><br/>Or consider sex - pornography or merely sexual self-expression? Depends on whether you're doing it for an audience, would be my argument.<br/><br/>To me all this seems pretty clear conceptually. I do agree that the material context of theater and roleplaying (or the written word and roleplaying!) can be practically identical, which may make the line between the two unimportant; it only matters for the design of the event, insofar as the creative agenda of whatever you are doing matters. Sometimes a LARP played well may be entirely serviceable as a theater-piece, and sometimes a theater production may be creatively just as liberating and satisfying and fun for the players as a roleplaying game would have been. The secondary outcome is accidental, but it is possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452581/#Comment_452581" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T21:46:34+00:00" title="April 23, 2016  9:46PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense, Eero.

Why not just freeform that, too?</blockquote>\nIn line with posts I have recently posted on this site, I am perfectly happy with freeform tabletop RP. I have referred recently, in posts on this site, to Chris Loizou's freeform version of Cursed Empire at Indiecon, which is always highly atmospheric and great for the roleplay. The reason why I personally prefer to have mechanics for combat is hard to pin down. There are probably various confluent reasons. I would hazard a guess that the main reason is that I find it easier to believe in the process and outcome of a fight (or other conflict or struggle), whether as player or as GM, if I know that the ultimate outcome is strongly influenced by factors other than immediate fiat, so that I am not second-guessing the GM (or the players). <br/><br/>But whatever the reasons are for preferring to have mechanics, they are not strong enough to outweigh my objection to intrusive social mechanics, which is that they stifle and destroy what is for me (subjectively) the great joy of tabletop RPGs:- natural, flowing dialogue as the medium of roleplay.<br/><br/><b>THE</b> reason why it is acceptable to use mechanics for combat but not social interaction is that it is <b>NOT</b> possible in a tabletop RPG to use real-world combat to represent fictional combat, but it <b>IS</b> possible to use real-world dialogue to represent fictional dialogue. What's more, even with LARP, the approximation to real-world combat used with foam swords is very much an obvious approximation, whereas the real-world dialogue used to represent fictional dialogue in RP in general can be almost indistinguishable from the fictional dialogue itself. The closer the real-world process (dialogue, combat or whatever) resembles the fictional process, the easier it is to suspend your disbelief in the proposition that you are doing what your character is doing and that by extension you are your character. That is where the immersion comes from that seems to mystify so many people.<br/><br/>In the same way, and even more importantly in a way, leading on to my next point, we can use real-world thought processes to represent the fictional thought-processes of our characters. The closer our real-world thoughts resemble the fictional thoughts of our characters, the easier it is to suspend our disbelief that we are doing what our characters are doing, and by extension that we are our characters. This explains why intrusive personality mechanics are rejected for reasons of immersion.<br/><br/>In other words, combat mechanics are OK because it's impossible to get an optimal contribution to immersion from the representation of combat at the table in any event. Dialogue and thought-processes, in contrast, can be represented in a way that contributes to immersion, to self-identity with the character, and since the contribution they make is invaluable, from the immersionist perspective, there is no sense in jettisoning them.<br/><br/>In other words you are looking at this conundrum entirely the wrong way round. You ask why is it not acceptable to freeform combat? The answer is that it IS acceptable to freeform combat, but there is no urgent need to, because mechanicalising combat does not kill an immersion-contributor in the way that mechanicalising dialogue or thought-processes does.\n<blockquote>When tactical gamers say that all the authorialising in narrative games gets in the way and breaks immersion, IMO what they actually mean is 'I don't like narrative games'. Likewise, when narrative gamers say they have a problem with all the combat mechanics in tactical games, what they're really saying is 'I don't like tactical games'.</blockquote>\nLeo, are you seriously implying that there are two kinds of gamers in the world, tactical and narrative? Even the outdated theory of GNS acknowledged three strands of gaming - tactical, narrative and a poorly defined third category to cover a multitude of sins. <br/><br/>I enjoy Chris Loizou's freeform Cursed Empire. I enjoyed Duty and Honour (Star Wars). Generally, I do not enjoy D&amp;D 3e, a highly tactical game. I am not a "tactical" gamer in the sense of being a gamer whose interest in the fiction is secondary to some desire for competition or challenge or triumphalism. On the contrary, my priority is the fiction. But whereas a "narrativist" gamer's priority is the <b>shape/shaping</b> of the fiction, I do not give two hoots about that, generally speaking. Rather, what I value is the <b>experience</b> of the fiction, more specifically the in-character experience of immersion. <b>Tactical</b> gamers are, by and large, not interested in immersion at all. I know, because I know plenty of tactical gamers (or wargamers, if you prefer), and they have not the remotest interest in immersion.<br/><br/>Your post is tantamount to denying my lived experience of gaming by implying that "immersion" is just a form of words, an excuse, a proxy for preferences or the like. By going down that path, you are in danger of precluding yourself from understanding what is being said in the discussion. I fully understand that you may not believe in the experience of "immersion in character" or in the genuineness of its importance to me or others, but you are going to have to suspend that disbelief, if you want any hope of fruitful discussion.\n<blockquote>I see two reasons:</blockquote>\nYes, I think there is something to be said for both, but I do not think that (un)familiarity alone is sufficient. I have played tons of D&amp;D 3e, and I continue to find it utterly counterimmersive, at least in the form in which I played it (under our particular DM).\n<blockquote>I do agree with you that description-based combat would be nicely compatible with an immersion priority.  I just think the group would need to internalize a lot of dialogue techniques to safeguard against the wrong kind of ignorance.  ... The GM needs to be really consistent with the right feedback.</blockquote>\nLike I say above, freeform tabletop RP (including for combat) is fine. Not my absolute top preference, but fine, and at least as enjoyable for me, on the whole, as even the best "narrativist" storygaming experiences (Duty and Honour Star Wars Hack). When you talk about "internalizing a lot of dialogue techniques", I suspect that you are overstating the case, but sure, you need a good GM who knows how to GM.\n<blockquote>I've occasionally wondered where the line is between improv theater and some of the rules-lite LARPs out there.</blockquote>\nI would say that I would probably consider a person to be playing a LARP if that person is portraying their character "live" (with posture, movement around the playing space etc.) and has freedom to decide their character's actions without reference to any dramatic or artistic or story-related criteria foreign to their character's fictional thought-process, provided that the person is playing the character for reasons of enjoyment (theirs or that of other people playing), and not so as to put on an artistic performance or hone their artistic skills. Someone who is playing an NPC according to plot-criteria or the needs of the game is, accordingly, not playing.<br/><br/>However, I think it's important to note that as always, there does not need to be a brightline distinction in order for the two categories to be valuable. You can have central cases of LARP (foam swords and combat stats) and central cases of improv theatre (say, short artistic exercises interrupted with frequent scene framing or discussion of techniques). You can also have borderline cases. The existence of borderline cases does not nullify the importance of the two terms, which are valid because the central cases of each of the two are highly distinct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452587/#Comment_452587" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T22:05:14+00:00" title="April 23, 2016 10:05PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You ask why is it not acceptable to freeform combat?

(Though I would welcome some!)</blockquote>\nImmersion is a personal psychological experience and everyone's psychology is different, but there appear to be common trends (not shared uniformly by everyone). Also there is a huge difference between saying that you find something "fun" or even "fun and immersive" and meaning that it gives you the psychological experience of identifying with your character (which is more what I mean when I use the term "immersion"). I do not rule out that some gamers might get that from social combat mechanics, but, I think, they would be in a very, very small minority. It is not about "enjoying the medium". It is about the game provoking a particular psychological experience, i.e. finding it easy to suspend your disbelief in the proposition that you are your character, broadly speaking such that you have heightened empathy with your character, and identify with them. In the general sense of "game", I can enjoy a game immensely without even the beginnings of that experience (e.g. a game of Go), but with RPGs, my preferred sort of enjoyment is when  that sort of immersion is there.<br/><br/>It is <b>NOT</b> about preference alone. It is <b>NOT</b> about trust alone (placing trust in a system etc.). How can I explain this so that you understand? You really ought to trust what I say about how the immersion process works for me and others like me, rather than thinking that you can figure us out by observation (can you read minds? - I didn't think so), based on disbelieving our reported experience. Hypothetically, I could write a system of personality mechanics and social conflict mechanics that provides a 100% believable simulation of personality and social conflict. That would be at best only marginally better at providing me with an immersive experience (in the sense in which I use the term) than Burning Wheel or D&amp;D 3e by the numbers or the most objectionable social combat system I could think of (i.e. still terrible). My ability to believe in or not believe in the outcomes dictated by the dice is <b>NOT</b> the point. The point is whether the process engages my brain in the way it would engage my character's thus tricking me into feeling almost as if my thoughts are my character's thoughts and that I am my character.<br/><br/>I think you have misunderstood what people mean about making the player's experience similar to the character's. Belief mechanics make the player's experience dissimilar to the character's because the player is metagaming the Beliefs system instead of thinking as the character. <b>ANY FORM OF RESOLUTION OF COMBAT IN A TABLETOP RPG</b> makes the player's experience dissimilar to the character's <b>WHETHER IT IS WITH DICE OR FREEFORM OR JENGA OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE</b>. Therefore by deciding that it should be dice-pools or whatever you are not doing any fundamental damage to the player's process of identifying with the character. However in a minor way some forms of combat resolution might work better for a given person's immersion than others. If the process obviously gives the player authorial power or important tactical knowledge their character doesn't have, that may be an extra counter-immersive element. But it could well be trivial for many players compared to the obvious fact that they are not, in fact, swinging a real sword with fatal intent (whereas they are, in fact, speaking real words).<br/><br/>Many features of D&amp;D's combat system I find somewhat counterimmersive because they seem, to me, to be a poor fit for real combat. My own attempts at designing combat systems are significantly more convincing to me personally. How good a simulation they can provide is limited by considerations of complexity/simplicity. But fundamentally, even the best way of resolving/representing fictional combat is a poor cousin to the way that roleplaying dialogue can resolve/represent fictional dialogue.<br/><br/>So here's the thing. In terms of immersion, it's the dialogue as my character and the thinking as my character that gets me into the character's headspace securely enough that I can remain in that headspace despite (and not because of) the combat mechanics. No form of mechanical representation/resolution of combat at a tabletop RPG is ever going to have much of a positive effect of getting me into my character's headspace. If I start a game with mechanically represented/resolved combat, I won't be immersed until the combat is over and we have done some actual roleplay. Maybe, just maybe, with freeform RP it might be sufficient to get me somewhat immersed (dice, definitely not) but the likelihood is that I need the dialoguey stuff to kickstart the process, and if combat is always going to be freeform, there might be that tinge of doubt at the back of my mind, second-guessing the GM. Would he really allow a blow to be fatal just because that could realistically happen? If not, the fights maybe don't seem real. That's much less of an issue with social interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452592/#Comment_452592" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T22:57:52+00:00" title="April 23, 2016 10:57PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2016 11:00PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me try and explain it in a less ranty way. (This is almost bound to fail due to strength of feeling.)<br/><br/>For me, immersion is the "in-character feeling".<br/><br/>To get that "in-character feeling", to feel "in character", I generally have to actually, really do things "in character". Not just talk about doing them or describe doing them - I have to be actually doing them for real in the real world, in an "in character" way.<br/><br/>In a tabletop RPG, above all, this means talking "in character".<br/><br/>It also means reasoning "in character", i.e. having the cognitive thought processes my character could have.<br/><br/>Live roleplay is more immersive for me, because there is more I can do "in character". I can walk around like my character, dress like my character etc. But for tabletop, talking in character and reasoning in character are at least a start.<br/><br/>What matters is that it feels convincing to me. OK, so my voice doesn't sound as thunderous as my fictional wizard's anger, and my thoughts aren't an exact perfect duplicate of an immortal vampire's thoughts, but it's close enough to feel real to me. <br/><br/>If I am not actually doing anything "in character" (i.e. doing it in the real world in an "in character" way), there's relatively little chance of me really getting that in-character feeling. If I'm doing LARP combat and it doesn't feel like how my character would be feeling, that may be a distraction from my immersion, the same as rolling dice or listening to a GM's description of me getting stabbed might be suboptimal from an immersion point of view.<br/><br/>I should also add that I had been roleplaying for many, many years before I really "got" immersion. I always enjoyed imagining being my character during the game, but my most satisfying experiences of immersion have only happened relatively recently (say, in the last 6 or 7 years). I was LARPing for a while before I "got" immersion.<br/><br/>I should also add that I could enjoy playing a game from a tactical point of view without that helping me to get the "in character" feeling to any significant extent. It really isn't about preferences. I used to love D&amp;D combat and get super worked up about it but it never ever gave me any kind of "in character" feeling. I've never played D&amp;D 4e, but I can imagine finding the combat system fascinating, but it still wouldn't give me an "in character" feeling, because it's all dice and squares and figures and tactics and abstractions. Who knows, I might love the metagame of a social combat system on its own merits if I didn't feel frustrated at not getting the in-character feeling, but no matter how much I loved it, it wouldn't give me that "in character" feeling any more than a game of Go (well, maybe a bit more, but not much).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452600/#Comment_452600" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T02:33:57+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  2:33AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2016 2:34AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think as long as we avoid conflating "this style of immersion isn't universal" (clearly true) with "there's no good reasons behind this style of immersion" (false, IMO), we're all largely in agreement about this last topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452613/#Comment_452613" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T16:28:54+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  4:28PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyway to put my rants in perspective factors relating to immersion are only a small part of the reason why "indie" games have not captured a larger market share.<br/><br/>For instance, the other day we playtested my Implodarc game, which is a trad-"indie" hybrid game where the players can pick the way they play as they go along. We only managed an hour of actual playing time but anyway for what it shows, in a group of GM+5, only one person (who has already done this sort of thing plenty) seemed to naturally plump for the "indie" options, and the others played it trad. I spoke with one of the players on the way back, a highly intelligent guy (an academic). I asked him how he felt about those "indie" options and what I understood him to be saying was that he was interested to find out what the GM's "story" was and he didn't want to mess that up. Now whether there are things to do with immersion bubbling away under the surface with him I wouldn't want to say with seeming 100% confidence but this idea of wanting to see where the GM is taking things is obviously a totally separate idea.<br/><br/>It's all very well trying to set up "immersion" in opposition to "storygames" for analytical purposes but it's not really rigorously accurate (for instance Montsegur 1244 was only psychologically painful for me because it in fact succeeded in creating bursts of immersion for me only to then require me to tolerate character-switching; and D&amp;D 3e would have an uphill struggle facilitating immersion for me, the way I've seen it DM'd), and the reasons people reject "indie" games are far broader. My personal reasons for preferring trad games as a player are mostly to do with immersion, but I am a drop in the ocean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452620/#Comment_452620" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T14:44:10+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  2:44PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2016 3:09PM by Airk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not sure that playtest anecdote has any value at all.

"Don't knock it till you've tried it," as is probably more often said by the adventurously-minded in the bedroom. But previously I have organised a couple of games of CHIEFS, my attempt at a storygame, and people generally didn't go a bundle on the hardcore "indie" set-up of that game either. Of course, there my methodology might be flawed because I am not, by preference, an "indie" gamer. Anyhow, interesting though it may be to coerce a person into playing it "indie" for the sake of satisfying my scientific curiosity, whether by cajoling them into so doing within the framework of Implodarc or by offering only a pure-"indie" game, socially, it is more convenient to give people an individual choice, and I would rather that my final game design did that.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, I'm happy to GM in a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-tight-fitting-pants manner, but when GMing in that way (or any way) I think I prefer to have at least some players who are purely players. On the other hand, I'm certainly comfortable with having or, I think, being a Deputy GM, as long as there are also pure players. But if no-one is willing to play, I can have fun playing an "indie" game, just, maybe not quite as much fun, though still, in some cases, a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452629/#Comment_452629" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T16:36:12+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  4:36PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even in GM-less games, I still tend to act like a GM, more concerned with overall plot development and playing to other player's characters than getting too wrapped up in whatever one I'm using at the moment.

I think that I understand your position, thanks to you having explained it quite thoroughly, and it makes sense. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if that view is really that significant for the gaming population at large (which has to do with games market share, for instance). You yourself say, for instance, that you didn't find your current preference for this sort of immersion until years of play and then delving into LARP experience. (And I doubt that describes the majority of gamers!)<br/><br/>Having said that, if you're interested in understanding a different point of view, you actually touched on it at the end of your "rant", earlier:\n<blockquote>[...] if combat is always going to be freeform, there might be that tinge of doubt at the back of my mind, second-guessing the GM. Would he really allow a blow to be fatal just because that could realistically happen? If not, the fights maybe don't seem real. That's much less of an issue with social interaction.</blockquote>\nThis is precisely the issue: for a lot of people, it's *not* "much less of an issue with social interaction". I've seen groups and games and GMs and players where they would have been perfectly happy freeforming combat but wanted something to lean on for social interaction.<br/><br/>I think most gamers agree that (most) mechanics should be (in an ideal world) as unobtrusive as possible, but we all end up accepting varying levels of "a necessary evil". <br/><br/>For some people, using mechanical means to establish things like social interactions gives the same sense of "objectivity" that you're describing for combat in that quote, above. If it allows a player to stop "second-guessing the GM", they can be far more immersed and enjoy the game more (as one simple example). This is where that element of *trust* I mentioned comes into play. In short, it really depends who you're playing with.<br/><br/>You can imagine how, for a group which is populated by players who are not good at pushing around their weight in arguments/debates and a GM who IS extremely strong-headed and skilled at winning arguments by nature, adopting a social conflict mechanic could strengthen their play and lead to stronger character identification in play.<br/><br/>I discovered this in reverse, by playing a diceless, freeform RPG with some good friends (and great gamers). I found that in various situations (in this particular, they were action sequences/physical feats and combat), it was so clear to me that in order to succeed at something I had to <i>figure out what the GM was expecting to hear</i>, and that made it almost impossible for me to simple "immerse in my character"; outside thoughts and concerns would constantly keep creeping in. ("That attempt didn't work, so that means the GM decided it wasn't the right approach. But it seemed like the best approach to my character! So what do I do now? Maybe he would like better if I tried this instead? That's not what I think my character would do, but I also can't ignore the character's desires to win here...")<br/><br/>Some players also really like having their character's ideas or feelings challenged and provoked, as another way of enhancing their feelings of "inhabiting a different person". Look up "bird-in-ear" techniques in immersionist Nordic LARPs, for example. That's an area of play developed by a play culture far more concerned (perhaps even obsessed?) with directions for immersion and bleed than the wider RPG culture, and yet they love such techniques, designing whole games around them.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>A follow-up question:<br/><br/>Has anyone here had an experience they can relate of a gamer or group of gamers who started with "indie"/'story' games, and then transitioned to play only "traditional" games?<br/><br/>How did it go? What made the switch? And what attitudes or principles did the group come away with after the transition? What do they play now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452635/#Comment_452635" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-25T18:25:35+00:00" title="April 25, 2016  6:25PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2016 8:35PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>When tactical gamers say that all the authorialising in narrative games gets in the way and breaks immersion, IMO what they actually mean is 'I don't like narrative games'.

Then of course, a lot of story games just won't be your thing. Feeling insecure about portraying a character with your poor acting skills and have your (still nonetheless awesome) group of friends laugh at you? that's a lot less SG in your list then. <br/><br/>OTOH, Do you hate it when system mastery equals a good game experience/ruining other player's experience? you probably are never ever playing or GMing 3.5 D&amp;D or Pathfinder again, specially not with X or Y splatbooks. Never did well with math or memorizing too many rules? There's a ton of games you are going to be scratching from your list again.<br/><br/>And then if you want to go back to immersion, well, I've got a friend in my group of players that gets small bursts of his otherwise unnoticeable tourette syndrome whenever he feels the atmosphere is getting the least bit dramatic, or when other players are portraying their characters with some seriousness. Because that ruins <i>his</i> immersion, so he ruins ours.<br/><br/>My immersion gets ruined by (besides my pal's rants) things like too complex systems, like when I've gotta deal with operations that take me longer than 20-30 seconds, or seach a rulebook for a similar time. But then another of my players feels more at ease with these kind of systems, and often ends up doing excel spreadsheets whenever he is GMing or playing one of these games. Another one loves 3.5 and PF, which I'm definitely not touching again since the whole system keeps disrupting my immersion. Yet I feel at ease with 5e, while the same PF dude can't stand the Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic, because he prefers something more deterministic, even if it's broken.<br/><br/>So I hope that under this light it may seem clearer that isn't only a matter of taste but one about things that make us feel insecure and uncomfortable. Pure logic and reason will get the discussion nowhere if this element isn't considered, because people have not only different tastes but different zones of confort, and on top of that, had different experiences when they tried to get out of there. You should probably be treating the whole issue a little more carefully, with more respect to each other's experience.

Human psychology is complex and all sorts of things could affect your immersion in character - not just preference or comfort/discomfort, but all sorts of unfathomable aspects of how your mind works. People tend to have aspects of this in common with each other but we are all individuals.\n<blockquote><blockquote>[...] if combat is always going to be freeform, there might be that tinge of doubt at the back of my mind, second-guessing the GM.</blockquote>\nThis is precisely the issue: for a lot of people, it's *not* "much less of an issue with social interaction". ... For some people, using mechanical means to establish things like social interactions gives the same sense of "objectivity" that you're describing for combat in that quote, above.  ...<br/><br/>I found that in various situations ..., it was so clear to me that in order to succeed at something I had to <i>figure out what the GM was expecting to hear</i>, and that made it almost impossible for me to simple "immerse in my character"; outside thoughts and concerns would constantly keep creeping in. ...</blockquote>\nWhilst I do not doubt that some people have the instincts you describe, my subjective perspective is influenced by my experience of GMing. I know that when I GM an NPC all I really have to do is inhabit their headspace as much as possible, effectively doing my best to immerse in character, or at least simply playing the NPC as comes naturally to me. Very rarely will my roleplay be warped by metagame considerations. Moreover, I find that, as GM, though I like to talk about being an evil GM, really I am rooting for the players. Because I tend to assume that most (half-decent) GMs have a similar approach, it is very easy for me to trust the GM to run social interactions reasonably. However, I know from running combat in a freeform or primarily freeform way that it involves more abstraction and analysis rather than just taking on the mantle of an NPC by instinct, and, perhaps more importantly, the stakes in combat are generally more immediate and higher. If a blow lands in combat, that may be death. If the King orders your execution because your etiquette was utterly lacking, you can still have a chance of escape. So the gist of the point that I am making is that whilst some people may feel the way you mention, probably a lot more people would reason more or less in the way I have set out.<br/><br/>Hence when our (70-strong) V:tR MET-LARP group discussed dropping social stats from uptime play, the minority who were very vocally in favour of keeping social stats for uptime play mainly argued their case on the basis that social stats gave a leg up to the less confident people, the wallflowers, the less socially able, and allowed them the chance to play a broader range of characters, and meant that more socially able players couldn't dumpstat their social stats and still benefit from their suave sophistication. The role of the STs/ASTs in playing NPCs fairly or unfairly, and the objectivity of the resolution process, were never brought into question. \n<blockquote>Definitely support Paul's point about social interaction guessing games.   I've never understood why in traditional games it was okay to play "convince the GM" here.</blockquote>\nBasically, to rephrase what I have said above, because (with any luck) the freeform GM is not generally making an arbitrary conscious decision as to how the NPC will react in a social situation; rather the GM is simply playing the NPC as comes naturally to him. Whereas the freeform GM is generally making an arbitrary conscious decision as to the outcome of a fight or a phase of a fight, especially when various totally diametrically opposed outcomes are equally plausible. \n<blockquote>You're going to have to forgive me here omni.  In my opinion, your "attempt at a storygame"  as someone who doesn't seem interested in storygames, falling flat for a bunch of people who expect RPGs to be a certain type of thing is practically a foregone conclusion.  I'm not sure how you could stack the deck harder without like, inviting RPGPundit to play in your session.</blockquote>\nYou're overstating your case, but not entirely unfairly. There are storygames I've enjoyed considerably more than certain trad RPGs. Also, of the participants in my games of CHIEFS, in game (1) one of them was an "indie" gamer on this site (they can name themself if they wish!), and although the rest of us were really probably trad gamers at heart, one was fairly new to roleplay and had mostly played forum-based story-writing games, and in game (2) one of the players was someone who I think is probably a storygamer at heart. Game (1) also suffered for many other reasons (tiredness, mismatch of expectations as to time needed, etc.).\n<blockquote>I have a question, actually.  If you don't LIKE storygames, why are you trying to write one?</blockquote>\nCuriosity / experimentation. At a deep, psychological level, I am a very open-minded person.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Leo, are you seriously implying that there are two kinds of gamers in the world, tactical and narrative? Even the outdated theory of GNS acknowledged three strands of gaming - tactical, narrative and a poorly defined third category to cover a multitude of sins.</blockquote>Broadly yes. And no, I've no idea what simulationism means either.</blockquote>\nOh come off it Leo; that's tantamount to saying to me: "Matt, all you're interested in is levelling up, grabbing the treasure and killing the bad guys; you profess that you're not interested in 'story', and therefore, as night follows day, it is obvious that you're not interested in atmosphere, characterisation, character portrayal, your character's personality, or anything else of a fictional nature, except as a minimal backdrop for a wargame". It comes off as story-snobbery on your part and it's completely absurd. Many, many gamers who are primarily interested in atmosphere, characterisation, character portrayal, character personality and other things of a fictional nature explore those interests within trad games and appear to prefer to do so; trad games done well can offer really excellent arenas for exploring those things. Saying that there is only tactical or narrative gaming, is basically saying that I and people like me don't exist, and I think you can be pretty sure that I do, for starters.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452642/#Comment_452642" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T01:18:48+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  1:18AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 1:19AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the GM and player both agree that working from the fiction is desirable and possible, then "read the GM" should not be an issue.

The last time I felt immersion, it was with monsterhearts, it was such a powerful experience that I felt compelled to write about it (in Spanish), and I feel my immersion was with the overall fiction, not only with my character.

Coherent vs incoherent don't explain many people's experience with indie games. I've often found myself to be trying to play games with obvious issues, sometimes a lot of them: in a wicked age, BW, AW. Most of them were a defying experience, forcing me to go to the forums, ask questions, change habits, etc. In the short term, learning new or different gaming skills is not exactly like finding an oasis of easy gaming. I have myself stopped using such terms as coherent design, because my opinion right now is that design interacts with a gaming culture, addressing some issues while posing new challenges. Things I used to call coherent design in the past, I find them now really difficult to run, specially indie games of the "first wave": sorcerer, the shadow of yesterday, in a wicked age, etc. <br/><br/>Even pbTA games, I consider pose new issues  for design. But their case is interesting because their success came from working with the traditional gaming structure, not against it. Burning wheel is another game strongly traditional (when compared to fiasco) that found a place in the hobby. Why do most of us still play games with GM? Flawed or not, that game style must provide something other ones can't, today.<br/><br/>I think the future of indie gaming is to continue with this "stealthy indie design", to reach even more trad gamers than we do now, even if progress is slow. In Argentina at least, we've found most of the breed of new gaming generations is done by tabletop gamers, not by market or Internet, so most arguments about coherent design or immersion, indie games and osr, is ignored by a vast majority of roleplayers, who still use d&amp;d 3rd Ed, wod games, with d&amp;d 5th Ed being and exception. Perhaps Facebook might change this, as more people than ever are dragged to discussions that previously where for forums only.

For computer games, game theorists have come up with <i>presence</i> (spatial immersion). My studies in immersion have made me discover that the following types of immersion exist: <i>flow </i>(immersion in mechanics), <i>presence </i>(immersion in setting), immersion in <i>fiction</i>, immersion in <i>group</i>, and immersion in <i>meaning</i>.<br/><br/>So I totally agree with you. I made a storytelling game called <a href="http://www.urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt" rel="nofollow">Imagine</a> that was all about immersion in fiction, to give an example.<br/><br/>(Do note: character immersion is usually immersion in the character's meaning. It's not even its own thing!)<br/><br/>This is however confusing for roleplaying gamers to understand, so I call it \xbbengagement\xab instead. It's then easier for 90% of them to get it.<br/><br/>I could talk more about the different kinds of immersion in another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452649/#Comment_452649" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T10:46:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2016 10:46AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 10:52AM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't like reading someone lecture us about what immersion is or should be, narrowing it to mean only immersion-in-character.

Language means what language is used to mean; I do not claim that using "immersion" for "immersion in character" is sacred, but neither can you claim that using "immersion" more broadly is sacred. In general English, outside tabletop RPG circles, and even for many tabletop roleplayers, "immersion" has a different or broader meaning. In point of fact, The RPG Pundit (mentioned upthread) seems to use the term "immersion" in a broader sense to encompass what he feels when he GMs. However, I do not feel that I can be properly criticised for defining a term and using it consistently in a defined way. <br/><br/>I also think that the phenomenon of immersion in character (1) deserves separate consideration in its own right, because it is such a distinctive and (relatively) common phenomenon in tabletop roleplay and LARP, and (unlike every other form of "immersion") is more or less a unique phenomenon of roleplaying games (including LARP) and acting (in the Stanislavsky tradition, possibly including but certainly not limited to Method Acting), and (2) as such "immersion in character" needs its own snappy term, and (3) "immersion" does the job.<br/><br/>I do not, by this, imply any doubt regarding the power of your experience of Monsterhearts. From the way you describe it, perhaps a <i>part</i> of your "immersion in the fiction" was in fact immersion in character. Regardless, my choice of terminology does not preclude your experience. However, given the usefulness of confining "immersion" to mean "immersion in character" for the purposes of clarity of discussion, and the frequency with which the term is so used in the narrow circles of tabletop RP, I would invite you to use a different term, such as engrossment (in sense (2) as defined <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/engrossment" rel="nofollow"> here </a>), when you mean something broader than immersion in character. Engrossment (also referred to as "immersion" outside RP circles, and by some within RP circles) is a phenomenon not distinctive of or limited to RP. Engrossment can be experienced watching a spellbinding movie or reading (or writing) an absorbing novel or listening to poetry. Immersion in character is a much more distinctively roleplay-based phenomenon (acting and roleplay being materially similar for these purposes). Given the desirability of a special term for immersion in character, and the frequent use of the term "immersion" as that special term, using the term "immersion" in RP circles to refer to engrossment in general is what, in my opinion, muddies the waters.<br/><br/>If you have been reading my posts on this site lately, you should have understood that I do not claim (in any way, shape or form) that immersion (in character) is unique to trad games. On the contrary, Montsegur 1244 clearly provoked my immersion (hence the pain I felt in switching characters). I have acknowledged that immersion is a personal experience and the people's psychologies differ. An "indie" game could well be what best produces immersion (in character) for you and for many others. However, the way immersion works for a large number of people, probably the majority of immersively inclined roleplayers but at any rate a significant number of people, is an important aspect (one of many aspects) in explaining and understanding why trad games work very well for many people. It is vital when comparing how trad and "indie" games work to be able to talk openly and clearly about the advantages and disadvantages that one or the other sort of game may tend to have for immersion. So, I do not say that immersion is unique to trad, or even done in the way that is best for all people by trad games. What I say is that for many people trad does immersion better, and that that is an important part of the discussion, even if for some people, "indie" gives better immersion. <br/><br/>Also, most of the "indie" games that tend to do reasonably well at producing immersion may well do so by essentially the same mechanisms as trad games as the driving force of immersion (freeform roleplay of dialogue and freedom to play your character as comes naturally to you). Both trad games and "indie" games will have features/bugs that will be disruptive of immersion for one section of gamers or another, such as heavy mechanics or the need to trust the GM absolutely (many trad games) or authorial powers for players or character-switching (mainly "indie" games). You may be drawn to "indie" games because heavy mechanics or the need to trust the GM put you off "trad" games, but the essence of what drives immersion is probably the same for the vast, vast majority of players who "get" immersion whether from trad or "indie" games, i.e. (general) freeform roleplay of dialogue with (general) freedom to play your character as comes naturally to you (even if some disruption of that freeform exercise may be tolerable).<br/><br/>Regarding the mention of "bird-in-the-ear" techniques upthread, the way I prefer to handle that sort of thing in a tabletop scenario is always to frame a suggestion as a question or possibility, not dictating with an iron fist. For instance, I could pass a note to a player with the question on it (for them to consider privately) "could the fact that the NPC's hat is so much finer-feathered than yours be making you feel jealous?" Suggestions of this nature are safer made if it is open to the person to reject them, as that way if the person does reject the suggestion, that should not seem jarring to them (which it will do if it came in an imperative form). (Skilful hypnosis often relies on a similar principle.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press" title="kelmscott_press"><img alt="kelmscott_press" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press">kelmscott_press</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452650/#Comment_452650" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T12:05:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2016 12:05PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I discovered this in reverse, by playing a diceless, freeform RPG with some good friends (and great gamers).

What bothers me about freeform combat (and it only bothers me up to a certain point) is that when I am GMing I know that it's going to be a rare day when I'll feel comfortable actually killing a PC in freeform combat or inflicting grotesque injuries on them (unless the odds are totally stacked against them, e.g. man versus dragon, or man versus army), and I've seen a freeform GM shy away from killing my character too in circumstances where I was almost begging for it to happen. That excessive safety net makes freeform combat seem less threatening and less real.<br/><br/>In freeform social interaction, the GM is in no special position. To persuade a player character, as GM, I have to persuade the player. Were that not the case (because of personality mechanics and social interaction mechanics), the player's ability to make choices for the character, which is of the essence of roleplay, would be impaired. True enough, the point of a roleplaying game is for the players to roleplay; the GM is just the facilitator of that. But why should the GM not get some roleplay joy too, making choices for and as characters, rather than surrendering all of that to the mechanical arbitrariness of dice and rules?<br/><br/>Even if you can rightly characterise the GM's "choices" in social interaction as the GM arbitrarily judging people in social situations, the fact remains that from the GM's personal perspective it is not a conscious, deliberate, arbitrary choice, but rather the random process of what next comes naturally to him as an expression of the personality he has tried to adopt/mimic for the purposes of roleplaying that NPC. To me that is a positive, because it represents almost a guarantee that the GM will not be basing his decision on metagame pressures (and certainly it is easier for him to avoid doing so in freeform roleplay than in freeform combat adjudication - because the latter is conscious adjudication and the former, generally, is not, or at least need not be).<br/><br/>I do not see the social interaction as the player having an argument with the GM. I see it as the two people roleplaying characters who are having a fictional interaction with each other. Neither the player nor the GM has any need to analyse whether the other's responses are "fair" or "in line with the rules or spirit of the game". Each just gets on with playing their own character as comes naturally to them. When I adjudicate on combat, I find it annoying when players interrupt the flow of proceedings to make points about the rules - even when they are right, it's better to get the interruption finished as quickly as possible. Why on earth would I want people to be interrupting the flow of social interaction in order to quibble over whether it's being done fairly or in line with the rules or spirit of the game? Unless there's a glaring error to be pointed out, that does no-one's fun any favours. <br/><br/>So I really don't care if it's impossible to argue with me about which way my gut jumped on a particular social interaction. Because that's not the point or fun of the game. Just get on with the roleplay!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452653/#Comment_452653" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T14:35:43+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  2:35PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've occasionally wondered where the line is between improv theater and some of the rules-lite LARPs out there.</blockquote>\nI heard that Lin-Manuel Miranda (Pulitzer-Prize-winning author of the musical <i>Hamilton</i>) and his costar each choose one of two stances before coming to a certain scene.

Why not just freeform that, too?</blockquote>\nBut whatever the reasons are for preferring to have mechanics, they are not strong enough to outweigh my objection to intrusive social mechanics, which is that they stifle and destroy what is for me (subjectively) the great joy of tabletop RPGs:- natural, flowing dialogue as the medium of roleplay.</blockquote>\nRight. I get it, I really do.<br/><br/>My immersion is just ruined by the gulf between the quality of my social skills and my character's social skills. In some cases, I'm far more savvy than my character; in other cases, my character ought to be far more savvy than I.<br/><br/>I'd argue that social interaction in a game is not as direct as you think it is. Yes, it's more direct than combat. Sure, there's an element that you-the-player are verbally sparring with me-the-GM during social interaction, but that doesn't necessarily translate directly onto your PC sparring with my NPC. The translation requires various tools and models to make it work, and these--to me--can be immersion destroying, too, when they overwhelm the fun part of the interaction.<br/><br/>Like when your PC physically attacks my NPC, we have to translate that intent into the fiction through a model and system that relies on real-world understanding (bad as it may be) of sword fighting as well as game-mechanics understanding to resolve what happens. We describe to some extent what each character does, determine which mechanics that triggers, execute based on those systems, and then interpret the mechanical result into fictional terms.<br/><br/>The same thing occurs when your PC verbally attacks my NPC. Exactly the same thing. We're just all better talkers than we are sword-fighters, so it seems more direct. My brother, who is an excellent fighter in the SCA, might feel just as comfortable explaining blow-by-blow which sword moves he uses to counter which of your PC's attacks, ruling by fiat how you lose. <br/><br/>And I get that you say you'd be pretty comfortable with this, because you want system to get out of your way. I get it.<br/><br/>But when you <i>can't</i> imagine all of these moves and don't have the background to determine by fiat what happened, can you see how that would be frustrating to try to resolve by fiat, and how that could destroy my immersion? That happens to me during social interactions (and I consider myself rather good at RL social interaction, for the record).<br/><br/>Imagine I'm running the old Cyberpunk RPG for you. You want to hack into a computer system. I want to resolve it by fiat; I'm a computer programmer RL and know this stuff. I'm talking to you about rootkits and zero-day hacks and buffer overruns. You just want to roll some d10's and see what happens. I could easily run that scene by fiat, but unless you're also a programmer, you'll balk at keeping up with the terminology and following what your character should know how to do. It will destroy your immersion.<br/><br/>Now maybe the rule is "free-form for what you know how to do; mechanics for everything else." But that only works if everyone knows how to do it and is on roughly the same playing field. If you're Kevin Mitnick, I'm not going to be able to adequately GM-by-fiat at hacking scene for you--we better go to the dice at some point. \n<blockquote>In other words, combat mechanics are OK because it's impossible to get an optimal contribution to immersion from the representation of combat at the table in any event. Dialogue and thought-processes, in contrast, can be represented in a way that contributes to immersion, to self-identity with the character, and since the contribution they make is invaluable, from the immersionist perspective, there is no sense in jettisoning them.</blockquote>\nI think that's a false premise. Some people could get an optimal contribution to immersion from combat representation. Most can't, but some could. <br/><br/>I think it's also wrong to believe that everyone gets an optimal contribution to immersion from representation of social interaction. Some people at the table are going to be better at it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452656/#Comment_452656" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T15:07:29+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  3:07PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 3:35PM by catty_big.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Leo, are you seriously implying that there are two kinds of gamers in the world, tactical and narrative?

When both things happen in his game only dice rolling help the players out of it; luckily for them the GM is also fair to the rules RAW. Also, it's part of his game philosophy that really good roleplaying can get you out of any spot, but that involves doing some reaaally suave performance. Also, it's best if it doesn't include actions that involve rolls in any way, or he will make you roll and ruin your whole scene because "that's what the dice say".<br/><br/>So, it's not like we can totally go freeform because of his particular social and cognitive skillset when we're roleplaying the characters nor when we're doing combat. <br/><br/>What to do? Well, I think we could be a bit more inclusive with game design, it's not too hard to do. Including or dropping social stats and rolls? Give the players the chance to chose it they want to roleplay or rollplay.<br/><br/>For roleplayers confident of their social negotiating skills, playing with a GM sensible enough to read their cue before anyone frustrates and who gives enough clues to them to generate interesting roleplay, let them drop the stats.<br/><br/>For players whose immersion is broken when they have to deal socially with other people, let them have those. Balance the game by making buying/leveling up those stats a mechanic not dependant on XP or other game currency; maybe these players can spend a maximum amount of points at the start and it remains the same for the entire game, maybe they can switch one or more points between the social stats to adjust according character development or player preference.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9BNoNFKCBI" rel="nofollow">I mean, why your immersion has to break mine, when it's so easy to design inclusive games so we can all play together?

Applied to other media, it would have much looser meaning, but it always seemed rather specific with RPGs in my circles. <br/><br/>I am always a little suspicious when I see people deconstructing or questioning immersion as a concept, simply because it usually begins the first volley in a debate over whether immersion in character is important. If folks are genuinely interested in immersion and have a slightly different meaning by it, then I'm fine drawing distinctions like 'in character immersion' so the discussion is clear. But if it is just about dissecting the word, so that any attempt by people who want in character immersion to matter in their games is futile, then I think it undermines something of great value in design and approach to play for certain people.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452674/#Comment_452674" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T19:45:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  7:45PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 7:51PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>social interaction in a game is not as direct as you think it is. ...

Are you actually using direct speech, with people speaking in character, to resolve and represent social interaction? When that happens, broadly speaking no-one needs to separately describe the social interaction (summarise it in indirect, reported speech). Mannerisms and tone of voice can be acted out at the table. Occasionally some description may be needed for some outlandish behaviour that cannot be conveyed when seated, or to add to the atmosphere. But with rare exceptions the social interaction played out at the table basically IS the social interaction in the fiction. It is almost the exact same thing.<br/><br/>In my games Soul's Calling and Implodarc, both works in progress, you make rolls for social mechanics prior to commencing key social interactions, and the GM uses the results of those rolls to bias how he GMs the scenario, both in his roleplay of NPCs, and in hints and descriptions he gives (on a neutral outcome of the dice, the GM just GMs the scenario as comes naturally). This works very well, and does build on the idea that the interaction in the fiction is subtly different from the real-world interaction reflecting the way the dice-rolls and stats divert from the players' real-world luck and ability. However the key word here is "subtly".<br/><br/>Only in very limited situations where the players literally cannot say the words their characters would say, or even approximate them, do you need to resort to indirect, reported speech (which is reluctantly permitted in Implodarc to accommodate a broader range of gamers, but impermissible in Soul's Calling, the more puristic game). The main examples I can think of, in a fantasy game, are when giving detailed directions to get from one place to another (when the players don't know the local geography), or when making complex legal or perhaps theological arguments, debating the ins and outs of magic and the like. <br/><br/>But 99% of the time, the players are entirely capable of at least approximating the general sense of the words their PCs convey. So player-on-GM verbal sparring does translate very closely into PC-on-NPC verbal sparring. No explicit tools or models are required to make this work.\n<blockquote>The same thing occurs when your PC verbally attacks my NPC.</blockquote>\nNo way. The relationship between real-world acts and fictional acts is fundamentally different for combat than for social interaction. Even the best olympic fencer with a PhD in the most pertinent field (English Language? Classical Physics? Biomechanics?) is going to be incapable of giving a totally perfect verbal representation of an olympic fencing contest. Even a five-year-old can give a perfect representation of what his character says, if you are willing to imagine that the character speaks the way the five-year-old does.\n<blockquote>But when you <i>can't</i> imagine all of these moves and don't have the background to determine by fiat what happened... </blockquote>\nHow is it even possible for you to fail to be able to imagine your character saying the very things that you personally are directly saying?\n<blockquote>...Some people could get an optimal contribution to immersion from combat representation. Most can't, but some could. <br/><br/>I think it's also wrong to believe that everyone gets an optimal contribution to immersion from representation of social interaction.

All I am saying is that there are common trends, which you appear to agree with. I was clearly talking in generalities, but not absolutes.\n<blockquote>... there are broadly speaking two types of roleplaying, from which there are many offshoots, and of which there are many variations.   </blockquote>\nIf you want to say that there is fiction-oriented roleplay and there is system-oriented roleplay, that I will accept. But immersive roleplay, and various styles of trad roleplay, are fiction-oriented, not system-oriented. To divide the RP world into "narrative" (or maybe "indie") and "tactical" is completely ludicrous. Many, many gamers reject both shared narrative authority / a shared storytelling agenda in all its forms, and all forms of tactical / competitive agenda, at least as a fundamental aim. If you include all the gamers who not fundamentally wargamers in the concept of "narrative" (or "indie") gamers, you are using the word "narrative" (or "indie") in a really weird way, to include gamers like myself who actually have no pressing interest in "contributing to the story", and who simply want to play their characters from their characters' points of view and experience the game-fiction as their characters would. So how do you divide RP into your two schools, then, Leo? Do you put folks like me in with the wargamers and deny our interest in immersion and exploration, or do you put us in with the narrativists and deny our rejection of shared narrative authority or storytelling aims?<br/><br/>(I do not mean to imply that I am always against shared narrative authority in all its forms but merely that my optimal preference is that when I play I do not have it, and when I GM there are some players who do not have it.)\n<blockquote>I mean, why your immersion has to break mine, when it's so easy to design inclusive games so we can all play together?

Implodarc is my attempt at an inclusive game, a trindie game if you will, a genuine trad/"indie" hybrid. But Soul's Calling, a more purist game, is much more optimal for me. The sacrifices I make in Implodarc for the sake of broader appeal will detract from my immersive enjoyment somewhat. And even in Implodarc, the social mechanics get out of the way of my immersion as much as possible. Where I make a concession, it is that indirect speech is fine... but direct speech is <i>encouraged</i>. Because if I am playing with you, and my direct speech is met with indirect speech from you, that spoils my experience of the game; it spoils my excitement, and my immersion. And this coming from someone who had used direct speech in roleplay only in LARPs, and indirect speech consistently in tabletop RP, until probably some time in the last 5 or 6 years or so.\n<blockquote>Because I thought those years when designers were accused of ruining immersion were gone for good.</blockquote>\nIt is not a bad thing that designers are accused of ruining immersion; it is inevitable. People have different tastes (some value immersion; some do not), and even among people who value immersion, people's minds work differently. There will hopefully always be designers designing games catering to immersive gamers, and designers designing games to cater to other sorts of gamers. What is optimal for one, will rarely be optimal for all the rest. So if all of us are to have access to games that optimally suit us, we have to accept that people will argue over whether designs ruin immersion. Or ruin collaborative creativity. Or ruin tactical depth. Or ruin the atmosphere of horror or mysteriousness. Or ruin the possibility of indulging one's trainspotter-like zeal for gun stats or for a vampire aesthetic. It's not a debating tactic used to justify clinging to narrow, grognardy horizons out of a fear of change or inhibitions against artsiness. It's a genuine sentiment and it deserves respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452676/#Comment_452676" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T20:50:27+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  8:50PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 8:50PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, this is pretty interesting:<br/><br/>1.

If what you want is a mechanical simulation of the world, by all means use your actuarial tables and dice and so forth. Maybe, just maybe, if you have several PhDs in psychology, the game-system you devise will be truer to life than freeform roleplay. Or maybe it won't. Maybe no system can do the same level justice to the unconscious cues of the fiction that we can do by incorporating our own unconscious cues from the real world into the resolution mechanism. But in any event, if what you want is a process that conjures up a vivid representation of the fiction in an ongoing and direct-seeming way, what you want is freeform dialogue. If what you want is immersion, what you want is freeform dialogue. Caveat, I am speaking in generalities, not absolutes. For some people, even immersion in character may work differently than I paint it here.<br/><br/>By the way, upthread I used (and took) the "represent" word-family to mean and refer to portrayal, rather than accuracy of task/conflict resolution, so I think you are using it differently than I was.\n<blockquote>2.

That will *definitely* ruin someone's immersion (most likely the players), if not stall the whole game.</blockquote>\nI could not disagree more. As a player, I am perfectly happy in a state of uncertainty as to how "well" I am doing at convincing the GM. I see no need whatsoever for the opaqueness of the GM's manner to stall the game.\n<blockquote>Likewise, the GM could benefit from a form of input, for various reasons.

The RPG Pundit would, I think, probably argue that that is (roughly) what reactions tables in BECMI D&amp;D or Rules Cylcopedia D&amp;D or maybe AD&amp;D 1e would achieve. It may ensure some variety in the GM's attitude so that the GM is prompted to actively avoid defaulting to whatever is the GM's norm. But none of those reasons would (in themselves, as so stated) justify dice-rolls during the dialogue itself (interrupting it), if those dice-rolls could instead take place beforehand, without interrupting the natural flow and twists and turns of the dialogue. Maybe they could justify interrupting the dialogue if some wholly unanticipated factor suddenly presents itself, but in my eyes from an immersive point of view it is still better not to interrupt the dialogue for mechanics for social interaction, once it's started.<br/><br/>Caveat to all this: if you roll before playing out the dialogue, I am assuming that that is intended to bias the GMing of the scenario but not dictate specific outcomes; if it dictates specific outcomes in advance, it will lead to very unnatural dialogue.\n<blockquote>3. I love the term "trindie"! That's great.</blockquote>\nIt definitely wasn't me who coined it - I think I first saw the term used on the ukroleplayers website, maybe a couple of years ago, maybe last year. It might have been Neil Gow who used it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452678/#Comment_452678" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T21:30:32+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  9:30PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are good points, omnifray. I may have slightly different immersion preferences than you. For instance, I see problems arising not so much when the player's activities are different from the character's (after all, we don't have too much trouble "staying in character" even though we're wearing jeans, sitting a table, rolling dice, and eating chips as we imagine our character starving in the desert), but when there is a disconnect about the fiction between the players and the GM (or other players), and that starts to interfere with the process of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Some GMs and some groups are really good at staying on the same page. For others, that is a very hard state to achieve, due to lacking skills, social difficulties, or even different genre influences.<br/><br/>Much like how combat mechanics might help you find objectivity and get on the same page in combat, for those groups it's been my experience that social mechanics of various sorts can really help immersion (by, just like in combat, cutting through the distracting elements).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452679/#Comment_452679" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T21:54:43+00:00" title="April 26, 2016  9:54PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 9:56PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember everyone that we aren't playing in the same way even when playing the same games, that includes the frame of mind and the depth at which each of us achieves immersion. Not even to mention the different types of immersion Rickard mentioned above:\n<blockquote><br/>There are however many kinds of immersion. For computer games, game theorists have come up with <i>presence</i> (spatial immersion). My studies in immersion have made me discover that the following types of immersion exist: <i>flow </i>(immersion in mechanics), <i>presence </i>(immersion in setting), immersion in <i>fiction</i>, immersion in <i>group</i>, and immersion in <i>meaning</i>.</blockquote>\nIf we just focus on Character Immersion or <i>Engagement</i> as he calls it, everyone experiences it in different ways through different mechanisms. I've talked about how some people I know experience the character even through their stats or dice rolls and built their Immersion from there.<br/><br/>So, Inclusive design in this context means being respectful of people who achieve immersion in different ways or even people who want different forms of immersion on the same table. Which strangely, it's where "trad games" win, since by having this blank frame that may mean different things for everyone they offer everyone a chance to achieve their own immersion.<br/><br/>It's a slight chance though, you need the right group, with the right skillset, sharing the right mindset, using the rules in the right way on the perfect atmosphere to achieve exactly the thing you want. No wonder so many people started writing their own heartbreakers first and their own games later. Some nods here and there may be all your group needs to achieve that perfect moment together.<br/><br/>My point with inclusive design is that as a designer you should be thinking how to allow people without your current mindset, social skillset, math skills, cultural background, impro skills nor creative ability to play your game and experience in the same way you do. It isn't too hard, it just requires a profound mental exercise in putting yourself in other people's shoes. That's it, whatever happens later can be blamed on players not reading enough, their own personal tastes, acquired trends of play or the people they play with.                        </div>\n<div

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You know, this is pretty interesting:<br/><br/>1. When it comes to "social interactions", we now have a great deal of scientific evidence pointing to social interactions being largely about subcommunication. Studies find that unconscious cues (body language, smells, surroundings, time of day, hormone levels) overwhelm rational behaviour, and that people often make decisions (sometimes very accurately!) within moments (sometimes seconds) of meeting a person or interacting with them. <br/><br/>This means that it's at least a somewhat reasonable argument for someone to say that "playing it out at the table" is not representative of true social encounters.<br/></blockquote>\nI would certainly be interested in hearing what people from different fields in the hard sciences have to say on this, but at the same time, I am pretty hesitant to rely on folks making a case for play style who bring these kinds of details into the conversation (since it is so easy to misapply the science). For example, I am sure my hormone levels, the smell of the gas station and a host of other factors matter to a degree when I go to pick up my car from the shop, but what the mechanic actually tells me still matters in how our interaction plays out. Things like non-verbal cues, are handled at the table if you are speaking in character (most people I game with will incorporate body language for example into their RP). You seem to be making an argument for determinism as a reason for in-character immersion being a flawed concept here and as far as I can tell, it is still hotly debated among both philosophers and scientists. <br/><br/>But even if we grant this, what matters to people who are after in character immersion is that they feel immersed in their character. I am not particularly concerned about obscure findings in the behavioral sciences when I role-play my character and the GM role-plays an NPC. For me what matters is the i feel like I am there, having a real conversation and the outcome feels plausible based on the interaction. So I just don't think these kinds of arguments hold much water. <br/><br/>If you don't go in for that kind of character immersion, that is fine. If you don't like engaging in in game dialogue at the table and prefer something more abstract, that is cool too. But there are plenty of legitimate reasons to want that and to avoid mechanics that interfere with it. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452682/#Comment_452682" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-26T22:17:59+00:00" title="April 26, 2016 10:17PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2016 10:19PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it's just a curious side-point.

My character knows a lot of stuff about feints and parries and giving ground and when to hit with the butt end of the spear that I don't.  So we don't require me to explain all those bits, and we allow me to abstract that when I say "I'm going to try to press him back against the wall and stab him." that my character takes the necessarily actions to actually make that happen.<br/><br/>In a social situation, I know that my goal is to embarrass the mayor in front of the gentry.  My character knows a lot of stuff about innuendo and double entendres and body language and tone that I don't.  But somehow, we're NOT allowed to extrapolate from what I say, so that when I say "Ah.... but... you see, you've forgotten that er... you explained the new tax as being for the benefit of the guilds...right?" that that is somehow interpreted as exactly what my character is doing, even though he's a charmer and I occasionally introduce myself by saying "Er, yes, I'm Chris's sister, er, I mean Chris IS my sister."<br/><br/>Why are these two things handled differently?  I tend to find that the more "immersive" choice is the one that makes me feel like my character.  And the one that makes me feel like a fast talking charmer is NOT "We took your stammering attempt and innuendo to be verbatim what you said."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452696/#Comment_452696" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T15:28:45+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  3:28PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 3:50PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I see problems arising ... when there is a disconnect about the fiction between the players and the GM (or other players), and that starts to interfere with the process of roleplaying.</blockquote>\n"Disconnect" sounds vague enough to cover a multitude of sins. Certainly, when everyone discovers half an hour in that the GM and two players thought that the PCs were in a crowded tavern with plenty of eavesdroppers and the other three players thought that the PCs were alone in a private, secluded location, that could ruin the whole evening for everyone.\n<blockquote>(after all, we don't have too much trouble "staying in character" even though we're wearing jeans, sitting a table, rolling dice, and eating chips as we imagine our character starving in the desert)</blockquote>\nOn the other hand I have heard a highly intelligent LARPer say that he doesn't play tabletop games because he can't get into character when he is in his hoodie (i.e. he can't immerse when he is wearing modern clothes). I however personally found the hood of my hoodie quite helpful for my immersion in the Crimson Empires game Four Orcs and One Dwarf I once played at Indiecon. From the outside it looked like a bright red Hollister hoodie but from inside the hood seemed dark and sufficiently orcish :-)\n<blockquote>My point with inclusive design is that as a designer you should be thinking how to allow people without your current mindset, social skillset, math skills, cultural background, impro skills nor creative ability to play your game and experience in the same way you do. It isn't too hard, it just requires a profound mental exercise in putting yourself in other people's shoes. </blockquote>\nSo let me get this straight:- a "profound mental exercise in putting yourself in other people's shoes" is something you can characterise with a straight face as something that "isn't too hard"??? <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/><br/>Because on the contrary after long effort and having identified many game-features that work great for me and for many others (especially with me there to shepherd them along), I still feel as if I'm a long way off cracking the whole puzzle, if that's even humanly possible (which I doubt).\n<blockquote>Oh, it's just a curious side-point. I was raising it only in reaction to the idea that a bunch of gamers roleplaying a queen talking to a psionic ogre is a realistic representation of the fictional events in question.<br/><br/>In some respects, a boffer-LARP enactment of a fight scene is much more representative of combat than an in-character social conflict, especially given the average gamer's breadth of skills and experience.<br/><br/>Surely everyone has seen social interactions proceed in completely unpredictable ways - and not due to the pure content of what people were saying at the time - throughout their lives? It's very common. </blockquote>\nAt the risk of opening myself up to a deluge of artillery fire, my strong preference is for players to be encouraged to play the gender they identify as, unless they really can't immerse that way. Provided the queen is played by a girl/woman/female, I have no problem with the notion that a bunch of gamers roleplaying the queen talking to the psionic ogre could be a credible representation of the fictional events. Note, the word I use here is credible (believable), rather than realistic as such.<br/><br/>I have done oodles of foam-sword LARP and it is nothing like a real fight. For starters you never actually thrust your foam sword into your foe's abdomen spilling his guts on the floor (or if you do, the game probably ends there, to be swiftly followed by interminable legal complications). When you are struck, you do not feel pain... or at least, generally speaking, nothing comparable to real injury from a metal sword swung in anger. Blows are struck very differently than in any real combat (often quicker because the weapons are ridiculously light... even the difference between lighter and heavier foam weapons is significant here); shields are moved more easily (because they are lighter, and consequently may have more convenient grips of a sort that would be impractical for use with with the heaviest wooden shields over a long period of time); in many systems (including my favourite and all the systems I personally have experience with), thrusting is banned; in many systems (including my favourite in its current form) grappling is banned. At least in tabletop RPGs you can have grappling! (Albeit often not without a shudder of terror from whoever has to consult the rulebook and adjudicate on it.) To be clear, on the whole, yes, LARP combat is a more immediate and direct representation of the fictional combat than tabletop combat can be, but it is nowhere near as immediate and direct a representation of fictional combat as freeform roleplay is of fictional dialogue.<br/><br/>Even if social interaction can be unpredictable, the different possible permutations in a fight present themselves radically more starkly. Seconds make a difference between life and death, with no coming back from that. A slip, a tiny misjudgement, or just looking in the wrong direction, can end things for you. I am not saying that there can never be any parallel in social interaction, but it's not generally so glaringly obvious to the participants in the game that the GM has just had to make a conscious, arbitrary choice between two equally plausible and diametrically opposite possibilities.\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>But even if we grant this, what matters to people who are after in character immersion is that they feel immersed in their character. I am not particularly concerned about obscure findings in the behavioral sciences when I role-play my character and the GM role-plays an NPC.

So I just don't think these kinds of arguments hold much water. <br/><br/>If you don't go in for that kind of character immersion, that is fine.

I get some folks might be concerned about the character-player disconnect when it comes to this, but would anyone seriously argue that Larpers are less immersed when they are swinging swords at one another than gamers rolling dice and consulting to-hit-charts? I tend to thing that Larping would be the more immersive experience (even if my personal skill level doesn't rise to the same level as my character's). In fact, while I have never larped, I have years of sparring experience from martial arts and boxing. I can assure you, when you spar, it is immersive because you are literally performing the act. Just like when you play basketball you are immersed in the game because you are literally being a basketball player. So I definitely say the more 1-1 the act you are performing at the table matches the act your character is doing, the more immersive. <br/><br/>It is just we make the trade off because it is much more convenient, better for flow, and safer to not pull out boffer weapons during a table top RPG. By the same token, I think when you speak in character, it is hard to argue that isn't generally much more immersive. There may still be good reasons to prefer another approach (because you value your character's skills, not your own, being important at the table). But I see that as a very different issue from character immersion. Immersion is just about feeling like you are sensing things through the character, feeling like you are the character in that moment. But you are always going to be limited by your own brain in that experience. <br/><br/>I think what you are describing is more like simulating a character. But people who are after immersion want to get into character. They want the feel.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452698/#Comment_452698" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T15:44:20+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  3:44PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 4:30PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>How is it even possible for you to fail to be able to imagine your character saying the very things that you personally are directly saying?<br/></blockquote>\nSee, this is exactly the problem. <br/><br/>In combat, I know my goal is to get the sharp end of the spear into the other guy.  My character knows a lot of stuff about feints and parries and giving ground and when to hit with the butt end of the spear that I don't.  So we don't require me to explain all those bits, and we allow me to abstract that when I say "I'm going to try to press him back against the wall and stab him." that my character takes the necessarily actions to actually make that happen.<br/><br/>In a social situation, I know that my goal is to embarrass the mayor in front of the gentry.  My character knows a lot of stuff about innuendo and double entendres and body language and tone that I don't.  But somehow, we're NOT allowed to extrapolate from what I say, so that when I say "Ah.... but... you see, you've forgotten that er... you explained the new tax as being for the benefit of the guilds...right?" that that is somehow interpreted as exactly what my character is doing, even though he's a charmer and I occasionally introduce myself by saying "Er, yes, I'm Chris's sister, er, I mean Chris IS my sister."<br/><br/>Why are these two things handled differently?  I tend to find that the more "immersive" choice is the one that makes me feel like my character.  And the one that makes me feel like a fast talking charmer is NOT "We took your stammering attempt and innuendo to be verbatim what you said."</blockquote>\nWhilst I understand where you're coming from, I think first of all that you are representative of a fairly small minority (in turn within the immersive minority, again in turn within the RPG-playing minority of society), and secondly that there are ways of avoiding the problem you mention without requiring social interactions to be determined by dice and rules rather than by free-flowing natural dialogue.<br/><br/>Specifically, there is nothing to stop the GM taking account of your character's social stats in the same way that the GM would take account of any knowledge- or insight-type stats, namely by giving you hints, tips and information to help you.<br/><br/>Thus, if in one of my games (i.e. when I am GMing), I know that a wallflower-player is liable to lack confidence as to what sorts of conversational tactics to try, I can hand that player a private note saying something like "if your goal is to seduce the princess, given that she seems like the type to admire courage and bravery, it may be useful to mention, indirectly, things you have done that show you in a brave and courageous light, or to mention some anecdote that can only be explained by then mentioning some fact that shows you in a brave or courageous light". Probably, this could be done much better than the example I have just given.<br/><br/>In my particular set-up, I ask the players what their goals for important social interaction are before the important social interaction takes place. I do this mainly so that I know what dice-checks to ask for before the interaction takes place (we will only roll for the most important aspects as the potential aspects are very numerous so we have to be selective for the sake of saving time and achieving a smooth-running game). This also means that I have the chance to give you hints and tips if I feel you need them in order to play your character at the level of artfulness indicated by your social stats.<br/><br/>On a related note, even if there is some truth in the notion that you are having to second-guess what I am wanting to hear you say, we can get around any problems arising from that if your high social stats justify me giving you clues as to what sorts of things I would like to hear you say (ideally without actually writing the exact words down for you to read out). Yes you may still stammer or veer off into inappropriate innuendo for the situation, but you can have as much of a leg-up as you may need to materially eliminate any serious problems.<br/><br/>I should also mention that I have gamed with players who claimed to be utter wallflowers and socially inept. I did not personally find them to be as socially inept as they claimed. However that is by the by. What matters is that they did indeed seem to feel that the social stats system I use in Soul's Calling solved their issues. It reassured them to know that dice-rolls were being made using their social stats, and their social stats were being taken account of by the GM, albeit that their effect was indirect, filtered through my GMing activities (including especially through my roleplay of NPCs).<br/><br/>If you are in fact the sort of wallflower your post suggests (rather than that being just a hypothetical example) I really encourage you to get your group to try this approach because if what is holding you back from natural, freeform roleplay is fear of your own inadequacy, once the tools are in place to help you with your natural, freeform roleplay, you may surprise yourself with how much you enjoy it and how much better you may be at it than you would previously have thought.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452701/#Comment_452701" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T15:56:36+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  3:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So basically, you are just saying that instead of building a system, I should rely on my GM to compensate for the failures of the system by giving me hints, tips, etc?

The system might be built toward what he is suggesting (or at the very least it doesn't fight against him when he plays that way). You should do whatever you want. If you want to build a system for something go ahead. But he is just explaining how this can be done in a more free-form, speaking in character approach, and I find I do similar things when I run games. For example I like having social skills for characters so when this sort of thing does come up, even I can call for a roll or factor in their skill rank if a person with a particularly high level of skill is not being especially persuasive. Also this isn't about winning an oscar. It is more about vibe and feel. I just want for people to feel like they are there and for their actions and words to have weight in the game. \n<blockquote>I am a fan of the idea that we should determine the result ahead of time, and then roleplay to that - because I think it is a good way of sidestepping these kinds of issues, but at that point, I believe that the system used is basically irrelevant to immersion because either A) You've broken immersion regardless by breaking out the system or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> You can immerse yourself after the "system interlude" regardless of what kind of system was used to determine the results.

The fact that you are determining things in advance means they are not emerging as they would in a real conversation, so it is maybe more like quickly producing a script right before you do stuff. I can see how some people would find it immersive (the way I a sure an actor in a role can get immersed) but I would find the disconnect between when things happen to be a bit jarring. \n<blockquote>For the record, I sometimes am really bad at social scenes, and sometimes I am not.

It doesn't infuriate me that you want something different. I happen to find it not to my taste as a player when a game fights against me speaking in character (when it feels like nothing I say in character really matters). <br/><br/>I prefer games that allow for the kind of things Omnifray is asking for. And rather than see this as a design shortcoming or forcing me to design around issues, I see it as liberating and not interfering with my natural style. Such games are not demanding we be jerks to people. It isn't like you use speaking in character as an excuse to make fun of someone who might not have strong social skills. I've games with lots of people who have trouble with communication or engaging in social interactions. If people can't speak in character, I don't force them, if they try I give an A for effort. I also am not going to prevent someone from giving me additional details out of character to help explain what they are trying to do. The goal is to keep things in character as much as you can, but it is a game and there will be times when you have to step out to clarify things. <blockquote></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452708/#Comment_452708" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T16:52:47+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  4:52PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So let me get this straight:- a "profound mental exercise in putting yourself in other people's shoes" is something you can characterise with a straight face as something that "isn't too hard"??? <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/><br/>Because on the contrary after long effort and having identified many game-features that work great for me and for many others (especially with me there to shepherd them along), I still feel as if I'm a long way off cracking the whole puzzle, if that's even humanly possible (which I doubt).<br/></blockquote>\nGotcha! You are telling me you know your way to total immersion in your character, literally get into the character shoes, but can't do exactly the same -get into the shoes of a person who can't do what you do- to explain how can he try to do the same as you? Because that's all Inclusive design requires, explaining things better, thinking that the person who will pick up your game shares your interests but doesn't have the same skillset. That's it, that's the profound mental excercise I'm talking about. <br/><br/>Try playing a guy with poor social skills, totally new into larp who walks into a larp session. What kind of questions would he have? How would you explain it to him all the details and things he could do for fun? Of course, it's too much to explain it all, but how about a bare minimun so he can pick it up from there, learn and develop techiniques on his own while feeling safe enough to try things.<br/><br/>You will probably end up saying "Ok, for now just sit and watch", and after one session explain to him how you felt at some points, what was going through your mind when you did X or Y, what all those phrases and signals you used meant, etc. Which can be translated better into an AP video with comments, instead of a book. (BTW, it's interesting all the LARP specifics you wrote up there, I've never been able to tell there was such detailed complexity just by watching a LARP, even when I researched the subject a little when I compiled the linked Techniques list)<br/><br/>In my case, I ended up making a comic to explain how an AP went simultaneously in real world and in the player's head, pretty much like <a href="http://tabletitans.com/comic/whispers-of-dragons-page-111" rel="nofollow">Table Titans</a> though I'm thinking of adding a few more pages to it to explain the GM side more (right now it's more for the players) For the rest of it, I just had to explain everything as if I were talking with a person without any experience with tabletop RPGs. I feel quite confident about the result so far, in one playtest the mom of one of the players (the kid was 15, she was in her late 40's and not familiar with complex games, videogames, fantasy nor science fiction works except for a few blockbuster movies) got interested and played with us, and ended up kicking the heck out of the final boss. My next goal would be having someone like her GMing the game.\n<blockquote><br/>Are you talking at cross-purposes here?

For example, it's incredible how "Not blocking another's players idea" works. Line up all the mechanics you can to stop players and the GM from blocking each other, then add or recycle some to help players build into each other inputs and instant trust is generated as a subproduct, allowing for further creativity sparks to ignite the whole session in movement. Introduce a single conflict resolution mechanic as the block/regulator for courses of action and no one can resent against nobody, so frustration is reduced to a minimum and kept focused at the dice or cards or whatever props you use.<br/>At first it seems like nothing new, but then when you understand how and why it works, it can easily be used properly.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452709/#Comment_452709" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T17:02:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  5:02PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 5:16PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So basically, you are just saying that instead of building a system, I should rely on my GM to compensate for the failures of the system ...?

Basically, I am saying that instead of constructing mechanics to control the outcome of social interaction in the game, you may discover more enjoyment by relying on the GM to mitigate the gap between (a) your character's social abilities as codified in the system and (b) your personal talent (or lack of talent) for actual social interaction and for roleplaying social interaction (which are almost the same thing). <br/><br/>My view on this is not affected by your not being a fan of any sort of game that depends on the GM's discretion "because not all GMs can or will do so". IMHO any decent GM can and will do so (if prompted to do so by the players or rulebooks) if that is within the spirit of the game chosen by the group (which usually means if that is within the spirit of the game as presented in the rulebooks and modified by any matters of house style or house rules). If even when the spirit of the game so demands and the group so agrees your GM is incapable of this or unwilling, then your GM sounds a bit rubbish frankly and you should probably get a new one. If you can't, then I suppose you are stuck making the best of a bad job by whatever means you can, but only because your GM is a bit rubbish. <br/><br/>As for the system not giving this advice to GMs, that's easily fixed for you personally, by asking the GM to house-rule it, or by agreeing a house rule as a group, however your group works on this kind of question.<br/><br/>In relation to the example I gave, I don't think the GM should in terms say to the player "you should probably play up the 'bravery' angle" as if it were an instruction. Rather the GM is saying, in effect: "though I can't say with certainty what tactics will work best in this conversation until we've played it through, I would suggest that because of your character's superb social skills your character might well guess that emphasising his bravery could be a good tactic here".<br/><br/>The GM can use alternative techniques to similar effect. The GM can play the princess as gullible, naive, interested and easily seduced. The GM can also drop you hints of pure factual observation emphasising what is helpful to you, such as if you roleplay relating some anecdote of your bravery the GM could hand you a private note saying that "at the mention of your bravery you see the princess's eyes open a little wider with interest and  enthusiasm".<br/><br/>Basically, every possible alternative "should" be tried before giving up and resigning yourself to delegating your roleplay to the dice.\n<blockquote>I am a fan of the idea that we should determine the result ahead of time, and then roleplay to that - because I think it is a good way of sidestepping these kinds of issues, but at that point, I believe that the system used is basically irrelevant to immersion because either A) You've broken immersion regardless by breaking out the system or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> You can immerse yourself after the "system interlude" regardless of what kind of system was used to determine the results.  So there is no reason NOT to use a well developed social system with that method.</blockquote>\nJust to be absolutely clear, I do <b>not</b> in <b>any way</b> advocate determining the <b>result</b> of social interaction ahead of time then playing it out. There is a really important distinction here. Under the systems I am writing, you do <b>not</b> determine the <b>result</b> of social interaction ahead of time; you merely determine the GM's <b>bias</b> ahead of time. This is really fundamental. Determining the result ahead of time then simply playing lipservice to roleplaying it out would be anathema to me and would utterly ruin my immersion, at the very least if I were aware that that was how the situation was being determined, and especially if (a) the GM had to distort the course of the conversation in an obvious way to conform to the pre-ordained result or (b) I had to actively and consciously conform my roleplay to the pre-ordained result. I can hardly think of anything worse. I thought I was fairly clear about this upthread but I don't know why you're using this particular example unless you misunderstood what I said about Implodarc and Soul's Calling?\n<blockquote>But I am positively infuriated by the idea holding people to their own capabilities in a game about imagination.   I HAVE gamed with players who pretty much universally fail at social interactions even when assisted by systems like the one you describe - they make a game attempt that comes out as laughable as something that would actually work, but then we override that with... an actual SYSTEM.  Because that is what game systems are for.  It NOT the GM's job to fix this stuff.</blockquote>\nWell you must be pretty infuriated with LARP in general, given that:-<br/>(a) salon LARPs frequently use freeform roleplay as the sole or primary means of determining social interaction, and that means using player skill;<br/>(b) foam-sword LARPs probably universally use freeform roleplay as the sole or primary means of determining social interaction, and that means using player skill;<br/>(c) foam-sword LARPs by definition use foam-sword combat as the sole or primary means of determining combat, and that means using player skill.<br/><br/>What about combat tactics in games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons? They use players' capabilities too, in a different way. Consciously or not, we judge statistics and probabilities. We judge the the positioning of miniatures. We judge what powers we think the monsters will have to counter our powers, and what sorts of damage will harm them. This is all a matter of skill. Unless you want to exclude players from making any choices with any possible implications for the success of the player characters, you have to either resort to player skill, or turn the game into an elaborate version of Snakes and Ladders with a bit of extra narration and maybe posing / uttering predetermined lines.<br/><br/>As for your friends, well, I am talking about experience of GMing Soul's Calling for players with undoubtedly really quite significant issues (even if I did not personally find them as socially inept as they claimed to be), and in terms of social interaction in character, they were absolutely fine with the assistance the system gave. If what you say are "systems like the one [I] describe" haven't worked for you so far, I'm left wondering exactly what techniques (in detail) were used. Maybe they can be radically improved on.<br/><br/>You say "It [is] NOT the GM's job to fix this stuff", and you try to paint this as the GM fixing flaws in the system, but I regard it not as the GM fixing a system's flaws, but as a GM working within the framework established by a system I regard as more or less optimal, with the GM just doing what is, in fact, exactly his job and a significant part of it. There is, of course, no one true way of roleplaying, and if you enjoy playing games where the mechanics handle all these things for you, well, that's fine (though I really think you may be missing out), but rest assured, that in my world, game systems are NOT there to unnecessarily remove (even to a limited extent or in narrow contexts) the burden of a player actually roleplaying their character, and it IS the GM's job to be the essential bridge between the fiction and the characters' stats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452710/#Comment_452710" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T17:14:43+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  5:14PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>So let me get this straight:- a "profound mental exercise in putting yourself in other people's shoes" is something you can characterise with a straight face as something that "isn't too hard"??? <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/><br/>Because on the contrary after long effort and having identified many game-features that work great for me and for many others (especially with me there to shepherd them along), I still feel as if I'm a long way off cracking the whole puzzle, if that's even humanly possible (which I doubt).<br/></blockquote>\nGotcha!

I may feel "immersed" in the sense that I feel a strong sense of empathy towards my character and that I identify with them. Likewise I may feel a strong sense of empathy towards some gamer with radically different preferences and needs and psychological processes than mine. But we are talking about<b> affective empathy</b>, not <b>cognitive empathy</b>. Affective empathy means a sense of common feeling (cf. the German term Mitgefuehl, translated as compassion/sympathy); cognitive empathy means the ability to predict and analyse behaviour.<br/><br/>Autistic people may feel strong affective empathy; psychopaths may have strong cognitive empathy. The two kinds of empathy do interact, but they are not identical.<br/><br/>I can have all the affective empathy in the world for gamers of a totally different school than myself, but that in no way guarantees me any degree of cognitive empathy towards them. I can feel as if I share their feelings, but in no way does that guarantee that my feelings are an <i><b>accurate</b></i> reflection of theirs or that I can <b><i>predict</i></b> what will go down well with them. Quite possibly I can in fact do a reasonable job of sensing and predicting their feelings in different situations, given that (in common with most people) I do have a reasonable level of cognitive empathy, but bearing in mind what a complex and obscure phenomenon the experience of immersion or the enjoyment of a roleplaying game can be, it is very far from easy to get it exactly right. Gawds, anyone who reliably could, would be very rich very quickly! Because they could reliably write novels, screen plays and what have you with the broadest and deepest possible appeal.\n<blockquote>Yes, I'm looking for the applied psychology stuff, things like how to incentive creativity in specific ways. For example, it's incredible how "Not blocking another's players idea" works. Line up all the mechanics you can to stop players and the GM from blocking each other, then add or recycle some to help players build into each other inputs and instant trust is generated as a subproduct, allowing for further creativity sparks to ignite the whole session in movement. Introduce a single conflict resolution mechanic as the block/regulator for courses of action and no one can resent against nobody, so frustration is reduced to a minimum and kept focused at the dice or cards or whatever props you use.<br/>At first it seems like nothing new, but then when you understand how and why it works, it can easily be used properly.<br/></blockquote>\nAll this research may be interesting and valid up to a point but any mechanic or technique that assists one aspect of the enjoyment and experience of gaming is liable to detract from another, and anything that works well for most people is likely to work less well for some people, so ultimately game-design is likely to come down to prioritising different objectives and making trade-offs.

All you need now is some research on the experience of immersion from two points: how do you achieve it and how did gou get the skillset to achieve it. Formalize that into a text, video or any other media and that effort would be enough to help other people try to achieve it in their own way. That still doesn't look like too much effort to me, despite the fact that it could take say, maybe five years to put it down properly? probably less. For me too much effort would be, say trying to make a game in this way that also appeals to hardcore WoW gamers. And even that would be kind of doable. But hey, perhaps we're just talking here of perceptions given our different backgrounds and skillsets, I see it doable, that's it.<br/><br/>I've kinda spent my life reading and consuming all kind of narrative content, studied marketing and graphic design, investigated and practiced applied psychologry tricks in daily life, so perhaps that's why it seems doable for me. So putting myself in the shoes of a person without my background, I realize now that what I'm proposing may sound like science fiction, even if the scope of my proposal is reduced. I would actually need to explain more about how could that be done (more than I've already tried to do in previous posts, that is) in order for other people to understand how it can be accomplished.<br/><br/>Which is my point with inclusive design. Any human experience can be put into words - even if the result is still too obscure, but it can be done good enough to inspire other people to try experience the same thing. Saying "it's too much work" and then complaining other people doesn't get you it's just... ah, well, not my problem.\n<blockquote><br/>All this research may be interesting and valid up to a point but any mechanic or technique that assists one aspect of the enjoyment and experience of gaming is liable to detract from another, and anything that works well for most people is likely to work less well for some people, so ultimately game-design is likely to come down to prioritising different objectives and making trade-offs.

We play and design games. My degree is in history (and I wouldn't even claim to be an expert in that). I think if you think you understand these kinds of disabilities enough to provide useful mechanics for people, then by all means. Personally I am a little skeptical when people draw very liberally from advanced disciplines like that and port them into games, and I would be very cautious myself about adopting ideas from a field requiring training and schooling, with that kind of aim. It just is something I don't know enough about, don't understand well enough, and would worry about doing more harm than good because i don't think I'd understand the tools in question. What i do understand is how to run the kind of game I play at my table. I can give people advice on how I run stuff, why I design mechanics a particular way, etc. I can work hard to make sure the text in my games reflect what happens at my table and during playtests. But again, too much of bringing in sciences and social sciences to games feels a bit like "quantum selling" to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452719/#Comment_452719" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-27T19:29:55+00:00" title="April 27, 2016  7:29PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2016 7:31PM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's why I actually don't sell games like that. That would comparable at making a beer ad that explains what elements it's using and what it's appealing to get to you and still convince you of buying a beer, instead of just passing for an interesting example on how publicity mess with your mind to make you want to buy things.<br/><br/>My approach has always been reading all the games that I can find along with their APs and playing advice, then dismount every mechanic, analyze what effects they have in the players and formulate my hypothesis. Then I mount those mechanics on my games, try them out and contrast the hypothesis to confirm what it does, looking out for other variables that need to be considered.<br/><br/>So, I'm not really making anything new nor reinventing human communication, I'm just analyzing how it works with specific game mechanics and how can everything be brought together in the most efficient way, requiring the lowest learning curve while maximizing the chances for human interaction through conversation, ritual phrases, signals, gestures, etc. So far I've found that several mechanics can be resumed to perform several things at once and even then the human brain follows perfectly and even speeds and complicate things up even more because it naturally increases fun. <br/><br/>Roleplaying games are actually played at several levels at the same time.

Many of the techniques it uses could easily be ported into a rules-light RPG. One of them is that before the game the GM gets everyone to close their eyes and envision being their characters, answering (privately, in their heads) various questions as their characters would, such as "what really matters to you right now?" and "why?". In this process each player is encouraged to privately identify and focus on a "golden motive", their PC's single core drive and burning desire. <br/><br/>Another tip is that you can require each PC to have an identifiable voice and identifiable mannerisms, to help people get in the zone.</blockquote>\nThis is totally what I was talking about with inclusive design: explaining the players about the specifics of how to achieve Immersion the way you understand it. It's great, you totally got me interested (and I'm not a LARP guy at all), except for the part where you say "encouraged to privately identify and focus on a "golden motive", for which I would require a lot more of info as a player. <br/><br/>I mean, what counts as a good core drive for the game? Would players need different core drives or it's okey if we all share the same? Would the different core drives need to be conflicting because the game works best for interpersonal drama? <br/><br/>You're probably answering all this questions in your game, but the word that puts me off right now is "encouraged" as it sort of implies that <br/><br/>a) the golden motive isn't totally needed and <br/>b) it's up to the players to come up with something that could potentially make the difference between a good and a bad game experience. Because motivations are not only the engine of the characters but also act as limits to what they would do and how far will they go.<br/><br/>This has probably more to do with a personal experience: a player who got late into our Pathfinder campaign almost ruined it. He made a character who lived all his life in isolation, generally distrusted strangers and whose only motivation was to protect the forest he lived into. It was his preference and we respected it, but the GM had already running a country-wide campaign, requiring the players to travel far and had lots of interaction everywhere with different cultures.<br/><br/>So basically, his character didn't needed, trusted nor knew anything about each ours; he didn't care much for the kingdom beyond the forest and when any kind of threat to it was put out, he would basically go back to his forest and that would have been the end to his story. It didn't help out the campaign at all, so we had to force things a bit. My character found a way to befriend him, convinced him that whatever threatened the kingdom would wipe out his forest and while this didn't convinced him much, he forced things out a bit too so his character could join us. <br/><br/>We both experienced a broken immersion because our core drives had nothing in common, so for me now it's very important to engrain such things in the design as rules. It's actually stated as a question for all the players in the case of my game: "What does your group do for a living?" This way players can discuss it, come to an agreement and be on the same page with a common objective that is totally related to their personal core drives, which is the next question to create their characters. It's that simple, a single question that also defines the scope of the campaign for the ]GM and the kind of things the players want to do.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452781/#Comment_452781" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-29T16:56:05+00:00" title="April 29, 2016  4:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            omnifray,<br/><br/>I found your example of a GM technique to help a socially-inept player roleplay a charming character very interesting. You said that GM could suggest an avenue of attack ("mention your brave deeds", or some such) and then play the princess as very vulnerable to that kind of talk.<br/><br/>That's pretty fascinating! I hope you don't mind if I dig a little deeper. Here are my reactions to that:<br/><br/>1. It seems to me that in this case, the GM is effectively "playing both sides". He knows what's going to happen and how: essentially, either the character speaks of his bravery and succeeds, or does something else and probably fails. (I know that other approaches are possible, but it's been my experience that a GM who has a certain avenue for success in mind while be far less generous in arbitrating other possible solutions - that's just basic human nature.)<br/><br/>2. Telling the player that the princess is amenable to a certain thing, and then playing her accordingly seems almost EXACTLY like determining the outcome of the social interaction first, and THEN playing it out. Is it just the illusion of uncertainty that's necessary here for "immersion"?<br/><br/>I mean, yeah, the GM didn't *fully guarantee* that buttering her up in this way would work, but can you imagine a functional style of gaming where it *wouldn't*?<br/><br/>("Hey, you're bad at social stuff, so let me tell you how this is going to go..." -"Ok, I do that!" "Nope, tricked you! It doesn't work!" Doesn't sound terribly fun...)<br/><br/>3. What I find most fascinating is that you're looking to prioritize natural in-character dialogue, but fixing a perceived problem (the player with average social skills playing a very, very smooth character) with an out-of-character solution.<br/><br/>Here's your proposed way:<br/><br/>* Tell the player something that will work, then play that out.<br/><br/>How does it differ from these two (hypothetical) social conflict mechanics?<br/><br/>a) If the player can make a Social Skills roll, the GM gives him a strong hint about what might work against this person. Then you play it out.<br/><br/>(Apocalypse World works like this.)<br/><br/>b) Make a Social Skills roll, determine that the character wins over the princess, then consult with the GM to see what approach he could take to believably win her over. Once you have the answer ("talk about your brave deeds"), play out the scene.<br/><br/>(Some people might play Fiasco or Primetime Adventures like this.)<br/><br/>I agree that there are subtle differences, but I'd like to hear your take on what they are.<br/><br/>The main differences I see are not in the roleplay at all, but in the presentation of certain game factors (e.g. "Yes, I'm totally giving you an out-of-character hint, but, hey, it might not work, wink-wink").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452872/#Comment_452872" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-02T23:56:54+00:00" title="May  2, 2016 11:56PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>All you need now is some research ...

I believe I thought you were suggesting that it would be possible to provide a perfect, comprehensive analysis of what would work for immersion for basically everyone. That, I think, is not doable. However, I have spent several years - probably at least 6 or 7 - really rigorously analysing what works for immersion and what doesn't. I have done that not just with the benefit of my own experiences of immersion personally, and of watching roleplayers at play, but also with polls and discussions on Internet forums, primarily The Big Purple, but also the RPG site, this place and UK roleplayers. I have also read literature on Stanislavsky's theories of acting. In the process I think I have distilled a lot of wisdom on immersion, and most of it is in the draft appendix to my Soul's Calling core book (a work in progress). One day, perhaps, a final version will be widely available :-) But by no stretch of the imagination could I claim that it will be definitive.\n<blockquote>... what counts as a good core drive for the game?</blockquote>\n<br/>Speaking specifically from a puristic Soul's Calling point of view, the short answer is that the best golden motive is the golden motive that is most convincing for you personally, the particular player playing your particular character. No-one else need ever know your golden motive; it is a tool for your personal immersion. It is, incidentally, directly stolen from Stanislavsky's theories of acting. <br/><br/>The slightly longer answer is that as a player when you are not at the gaming table but preparing to be at the gaming table (during CharGen and between sessions) you do have some kind of a responsibility to check that your character, whether because of his golden motive or for any other reason, is not going to cause the group to immediately implode, and if there is a real risk of that, you should chat it over with the ref. But during actual play, your job is to play your character without restraint.\n<blockquote>You're probably answering all this questions in your game, but the word that puts me off right now is "encouraged" as it sort of implies that <br/><br/>a) the golden motive isn't totally needed and <br/>b) it's up to the players to come up with something that could potentially make the difference between a good and a bad game experience. ...</blockquote>\nIn Soul's Calling, a pure player should always at least start each session with a golden motive for their player character, but a deputy GM ("a-ref") doesn't have to do that. The golden motive is a private psychological tool for the player. In a less fascistic but avowedly pro-immersive game, the golden motive would be optional but recommended. I can't dictate to people how their minds will privately work, and there are no thought police checking that you have indeed dreamt up a golden motive or that you are sticking to it. It has no mechanical role under the rules. It can shift freely over the course of play, as the character's personality naturally and fluidly develops (in your real-world subconscious). \n<blockquote>This has probably more to do with a personal experience: a player who got late into our Pathfinder campaign almost ruined it. He made a character who lived all his life in isolation, generally distrusted strangers and whose only motivation was to protect the forest he lived into. ...</blockquote>\nYou don't necessarily need to focus on the base level of golden motive to address this sort of problem. PCs can stick together for less fundamental reasons. In Soul's Calling, character generation ideally starts with the group agreeing a "seeming common theme" to bind the PCs together superficially. The reality may be that the "seeming common theme" is a facade, an illusion, a semblance and nothing more. For instance the "seeming common theme" may be "pirates in search of treasure", but one PC may secretly be a shapeshifting blooddrinking merman who loves to be around when human blood is spilt into the water, and another PC could be a spy working for the King, perhaps trying to work out whether the pirates could be useful as licensed privateers who would only attack foreign vessels.\n<blockquote>1. It seems to me that in this case, the GM is effectively "playing both sides".</blockquote>\nThere is certainly a conceivable danger of contravening what is probably known around here as the "Czege principle", but I think that you are overstating the case. The GM has not planned the NPC's reactions in detail, and cannot give the players a detailed roadmap of the conversation in advance. The GM will usually be a lot less certain about what is going to happen than you imply. Also, the dropping of direct hints as to what topics to broach is one of the most potent weapons in the GM's arsenal; for players with less difficulty, the GM might well stick to subtler means. Even if the GM does drop those hints, the GM may well give alternatives. The GM is only speculating as to what may work. The conversation could certainly take an unexpected twist and what at first seemed like a great tactic might turn out to be rubbish, or vice versa - possibly because of something another PC does (whose player is not aware of the secret hints). The GM does his best, but might turn out to be genuinely mistaken. Also, it is (known to the players to be) legitimate for the GM to sometimes give misleading hints to players who roll badly. So if you follow the hints and it goes wrong, you may not immediately realise that that is because the GM made a mistake - you may think that you may have rolled worse than you thought. And that's all fine. Another thing is that the GM's hints will be terse and may be misinterpreted by the player. Again, this is all fine. What matters is that over the medium to long term the player is getting some bang for their social stats buck, even if sometimes there are hiccups, and that it is all handled in a very smooth, natural, unrestrictive way (i.e. that the rules are not restrictive of how the social interaction can potentially unfold, so as to risk giving it a jerky feel).\n<blockquote>a) If the player can make a Social Skills roll, the GM gives him a strong hint about what might work against this person. Then you play it out.<br/><br/>(Apocalypse World works like this.)</blockquote>\nI would have to see the AW rules written down to be sure, but in this particular aspect the basic approach seems to be the same. However in Soul's Calling the default mode is more likely to be the GM playing the NPC as gullible / easily manipulated etc., rather than relying on giving hints - partly because it is quicker to dive straight into the roleplay. Also, I am assuming that "then you play it out" means that despite the hint, anything can happen. That is crucial because the conversation has to be and appear totally natural.\n<blockquote>b) Make a Social Skills roll, determine that the character wins over the princess, then consult with the GM to see what approach he could take to believably win her over. Once you have the answer ("talk about your brave deeds"), play out the scene.</blockquote>\nAgain I would have to see the rules written down to be sure what you mean, but as described, this sounds antithetical to my approach. More specifically, it is very important (to my way of thinking) that the outcome of the social situation is absolutely <b>not</b> predetermined. A predetermined outcome can jeopardise the natural flow of conversation, just in the same way that interrupting social interaction for a Bluff check or Diplomacy check using D&amp;D 3e et al can cause the conversation to be jerked unnaturally off course.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452873/#Comment_452873" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T04:04:39+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  4:04AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good clarification, omnifray. A lot of that makes sense; although I still maintain that "GM gives a hint and then we play out" is a sort of play which can SO easily move into  one of the two problem areas I discussed (the GM effectively playing both sides of the conversation, like a GM setting up a puzzle and then being forced to "guide" the players into a specific solution she's dreamed up, and the social pitfall of giving a hint which feels like the only solid approach to the players and then having them left feeling duped if it doesn't work).<br/><br/>The first, I think, is very common in "immersionist" play groups I've seen. Some players don't mind it, at least some of the time. But it's a slippery slope, as well. The second is more problematic because it's messing with the social dynamic of creative roleplaying - personally, I would find it less immersive, I think, to have to worry about how a certain hint might be intended by the GM, and how I might be able to play along or, instead, surprise her.<br/><br/>The thing with a hint and playing it through is that it's very subtly delineated from "let's decide on an outcome and then play it out" - there's a lot of overlap, and that creates a pretty nebulous and weird space for the group to play in. There's a big danger, I think, of it becoming the latter but *with the very very strong intent by the group to pretend that it's not*. That merges into to a variety of "Illusionist" (or "railroady") practices which can have toxic effects on a game group.<br/><br/>The AW approach is potentially quite good: it's essentially a "reading" move which allows a socially-adept ("sharp") character to ask questions of the GM about the NPC in question. ("What is she afraid of?" "What about her is not as it seems?" - that kind of stuff.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452889/#Comment_452889" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T16:07:28+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  4:07PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 4:13PM by omnifray.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:-<br/><br/>I have to say that I have never felt while GMing Soul's Calling that we were playing out a pre-decided outcome or especially that we were pretending not to be doing so, contrary to the fact. As I say, the fact is that any hints given would be directed to one player individually, typically in a conversation where other players also have a strong role. But I don't default to the tactical-hint-giving option - usually I leave it to the players to dream up what to say, and the benefit they get from social stats rolls is only in how I play the NPCs or in factual-hint-giving i.e. giving private notes to players emphasising an NPC's "tells" or other useful body language / tone of voice (which I may have tried to imitate at the table anyway, or may not if only the most perceptive PC(s) should have the advantage of noticing them). <br/><br/>Speaking of myself personally, I don't think that I ever really get into a fixed mindset as to how the conversation has to go or what tactics may succeed or fail. I fully expect to be surprised from time to time by the twists and turns a fictional conversation takes.<br/><br/>I think that the hyperbolic vitriol directed (in the Forgey tradition) at "illusionist" styles of gaming is often a bit odd in itself. Personally, I would regard railroading as a major GMing failure on my part under most circumstances, though I do not say that it would always necessarily be a poor form of play:- from memory, Tomas has contributed interesting points to discussions on this site on this issue in the past if you care to search for them. However, the notion that tricking players is necessarily toxic is highly problematic because it conflates two very different situations (legitimate and illegitimate trickery) and the perception of (even illegitimate) trickery as problematic is rooted partly in a subconscious bias in favour of a "narrativist" "creative agenda".<br/><br/>Trickery can be legitimate where the express <b>or implied</b> understanding of the gaming group is that the players are fair game for trickery (or for trickery of the kind in question). As a player, in the immersive style of game I best enjoy (including in LARP), I am always game for trickery. I could happily be fed sensory input for my character only to later discover that it was a hallucination. I frequently take the same approach as a GM. <br/><br/>Trickery can be illegitimate where the express or implied understanding of the gaming group is that the players are not fair game for trickery (or not for trickery of the kind in question).<br/><br/>The hyperbolic vitriol emanating from the Forge on this issue seems to me to be partly fuelled by the preference for players to be empowered to contribute creatively to the shaping of what is perceived as a "narrative", or to what I would regard as the shaping of the broader fictional events of the game. For players for whom that is of the essence of play, of course it will seem gut-wrenching to be deprived of real creative impact by the machinations of the GM. For immersive players, however, the difficulty with railroading is much subtler. Remember, these players are not (or often not) all that bothered about their creative impact on the game. Rather, they are bothered about their sense of being their character, and thus by extension they are bothered about their freedom to be their character (by doing whatever they feel like their character would do, and making what seem to be real choices as their character) <b>insofar as</b> that impacts on their sense of being their character. Railroading in itself does not affect that experience unless it is noticed by the players. Successful illusionism is therefore <b>not</b> toxic in a group where the implied understanding is that trickery (as to the impact of player choices) is fine.<br/><br/>The trouble with railroading from an immersive point of view is really that it is impossible to hide it flawlessly. The players are pretty quickly going to notice when they are going round in circles. In fact they may often suspect railroading when it is not in fact happening (this has happened to me a couple of times when I was GMing, even fairly recently). Illusionism is problematic for these players when the mask slips. "Participtionism" is anathema to them. Trick them, sure; they do not <b>want</b> to know!<br/><br/>Thus, I have known players (even one I regard as basically a storygamer) explicitly say that they do not want to "see behind the curtain" (by analogy to the Wizard of Oz). They want to be in the dark as to how the GM does his magic.<br/><br/>I also know a gamer I regard as probably a storygamer (he once ambushed me at Indiecon with a "roleplaying poem", our only experience of gaming together) who apparently has explained his view along the lines that if the players don't know the impact of their choice of whether (for example) to pick the left tunnel or the right tunnel, it's still OK for the GM to (secretly) retcon his prep so that they get to the fun bit quicker. I would personally add a rider to say:- "it's fine to do this as long as the players have had <b>no possible hint</b> as to the likely impact of their choice".<br/><br/>Despite what I say above I prefer to absolutely avoid railroading in roleplaying games, I suppose partly as a personal challenge to show that I can run a highly entertaining game without resorting to that, and partly so that there is no risk of the mask slipping, because there is no mask.\n<blockquote>The AW approach is potentially quite good: it's essentially a "reading" move which allows a socially-adept ("sharp") character to ask questions of the GM about the NPC in question. ("What is she afraid of?" "What about her is not as it seems?" - that kind of stuff.)</blockquote>\nAh. Now you put it that way, it sounds quite different to my guidance in Soul's Calling, because the player is controlling the topic of the hint. I think that's an important distinction from a number of perspectives. From a "narrativist" perspective, you are protecting the player's autonomy and creative role and preserving the "Czege principle" as you might think of it. From an immersive perspective, however, there is the problem that the player is being required to make an arguably dissociated choice (whether it is dissociated or not may depend on the circumstances). Moreover, posing the question (with the implied right to a significant answer) may force retconning in a sense. For example, if I choose "what about her is not as it seems?" then you as GM presumably have to invent such a thing, and I as player have made a choice that my character would have had no concept of, to cause there to be something not as it seems about the NPC. Even if the GM can legitimately answer "nothing", I as player have made the choice that my character would notice that rather than noticing what might scare the NPC - whereas a real person would notice things regardless of whether looking for them, and would not necessarily notice things even if looking for them. Also from a tactical/"gamist" point of view the "reading" move gives the player tactical options (for the same reasons as it protects their autonomy) and from a "simulation" point of view it might be wobblier (because of the retconning and because the outcome is determined by the players and thus likely to be more optimal than a probabilistic approach would suggest).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452890/#Comment_452890" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T17:18:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  5:18PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 5:19PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think we were very slightly at cross-purposes.

Ah, I thought you meant that not even the bare minimum of explaining how to play a game focused on immersion was doable, which to be honest I'm sick of seeing in every hipster game design, often written in an obscure way and for which GMs and player advice not included in the text is often needed to understand what the author meant. That thing made me go into a research similar to yours, but in the field of conveying information to people, measuring how much info is needed and used to play a game, how to present it for the players to get their attention at the crucial parts that make it different to ther game experiences, etc.<br/><br/>Exactly this last point is why I often advocate to state advice <i>as rules</i>, to stop using words that may lead players to think a crucial game procedure isn't important enough to include it in their own experience of the game. Why? Because to play a game people need clear instructions. Advice isn't recognizced by the readers as instructions, and thus is temporally discarded until the brain can map how the whole process works.<br/><br/>What happens then when an RPG isn't clear about that special procedure that turns it into a different experience? The reader maps the process using the most familiar reference for it, which statistically in USA and South America, would probably mean that he would end up playing it like D&amp;D and complain that the game is broken.<br/><br/>I know that rules sound facist, writing them may feel like you're ordering players what to do and think when you want them to be free. Well, looking at it from the players side, you're not. I mean, readers have free will and it's stronger than you think, reading a book that tells them how to think and what to do won't really do them no harm, specially if you say <i>it's a game</i>. It doesn't even feel disrespectful to read things like that. What does come out as disrespectful (well, more like frustrating) is offering players a new different experience, explaining them how it's attained in an obscure way and then leave them wondering if it's their fault for not being clever enough to understand the author or not being creative/extrovert enough to make it work in play.<br/><br/>The main problem is that more often than you may think is possible, a really important part of the procedure needed to repeat the author's experience isn't explained because the author herself has done it so much that now it's second nature to her. So, things like "what is a good golden motive and what not" can't be easily tell by any reader not familiar with Stanislavsky's theories of acting, professional screenwriting or a somewhat wide experience with storytelling in general or roleplaying at least.<br/><br/>If you just tell players to be free, that won't count as an instruction for them to experience freedom the same way you do, unless you tell them exactly how and give them proper options to explore. Sooner or later they will ditch the options, rules, instructions  and advice to follow their own perfected ones, but not until they interiorize the whole process, for which they need a proper map first. They may even play it like D&amp;D but then it won't be because they thought that's what you meant, but because that's what they really want to play.<br/><br/>I get how the "golden motive" may or may not have to do with the group or character's objective in the game and how it's there more as a tool to help immersion; yeah, it doesn't do nothing with the mechanical rules, but if you're making a game about immersion it's worthy to state how exactly do you use it through a clear procedure, as if a teacher of acting was explaining you how to use it, that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452895/#Comment_452895" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T17:47:07+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  5:47PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> - my existing drafts already state many propositions as rules which in another game might be regarded as advice.

It makes a good deal of sense, and I appreciate you engaging in this discussion so fully.<br/><br/>I suspect, more and more, that this kind of debate often has to do more with play culture than actual games or techniques. There is a certain "old school" mentality where the GM provides <i>an experience</i> for the players, which contrasts strongly against the Forgite "we are all equal players" philsophy, and they have different implications. In practice, I think the games are played in an identical fashion for the most part, but philosophically there is quite a gulf.<br/><br/>I have no problem playing in an "immersionist" game where the GM is King, and things like mind tricks and Illusionism are part of the fabric of play. My goal is to experience fiction as my character, and, while I *like* to understand what's behind the curtain (I find magic shows where the tricks are revealed afterwards far more interesting, too), I can respect that others just want to experience the show, almost like passive entertainment.<br/><br/>Where it crosses a line for me is when the obfuscation becomes its own doctrine. If it's better for a player not to know that he's been "tricked" in a given session, then maybe I'd better not tell him that I'm going to be doing it in the whole campaign... and if I told him that it's a GM trick I use in general with other people, he might also start wondering if I ever do it while playing with him... so maybe I had better never mention it at all! From there it's an easy leap to, "Lie whenever discussions of GMing or roleplaying come up at all."<br/><br/>That can gradually turn into a whole roleplaying culture. (I've called the "GM Mystery Cult" in the past, as a shorthand.)<br/><br/>Perhaps this sound hyperbolic, but I've seen it, again and again, with group after group, and in my experience it is, at some level, the dominant paradigm in the roleplaying world. That's one of the reasons the Forge perspective, which had largely to do with "pulling aside the veil", was so radical (and presumably very offensive to anyone who had tried hard to maintain such illusions over the course of an entire gaming career).<br/><br/>And that's when things have a tendency to become toxic, even if it's relatively subtle. <br/><br/>To use a crude analogy (hopefully I won't offend anyone), it's a bit like faking orgasms with your sexual partner. You have the possible benefits of improving the apparent quality of the experience for your partner, but the potential negative side effects of reducing *their* ability to contribute to the experience. On top of that, there is the rather significant potential of ruining trust.<br/><br/>If your priority is to produce a highly powerful experience for the player/customer, "faking" makes a great deal of sense. (In the crude metaphor, a prostitute or someone really trying to impress/win over a new lover could be an example of this: they're trying to create an experience for the other, and the "other" has everything to gain by buying into it.) They can even know about it and willingly suspend their disbelief. (Especially in gaming, which is already make-believe, that's not too hard.) <br/><br/>However, if your priority is to create a strong framework for having fun together and to trust each other, to have each person's creative interests met, then it's not a good idea: over the long-term, you'll be eroding some other important aspects of the human relationship even if the creative endeavour (gaming, in this case) remains strong. The long-term relationship of the gaming group is being built up here, instead of the experience in the moment. (Much like a romantic partner who makes a point of being honest all the time - that can "ruin the magic" in some ways, but may be a better bet for long-term trust, to build something together.)<br/><br/>Personally, I draw a pretty hard line at lying: if you aren't allowed to say something about the game, or have to misrepresent it when talking about your game, that's when I want out. But I can understand that some other people might value the "experience" so much that they're willing to let that slide. <br/><br/>As for your analysis of the AW "reading" moves, I agree with you. Unlike you, I don't see anything wrong with asking a question of my choice (if I can immerse in my character and make choices about what the character is curious about, I can choose the question to ask from the character's viewpoint, as well), but it would be immersion-spoiling if I knew that the GM would be making up new material in response to the questions, for instance. <br/><br/>Thank you for the interesting discussion!<br/><br/>WarriorMonk's post, above, touches on the very same topic, in my opinion. Where do we balance clarity of communication with "preserving the magic"?<br/><br/>As an artist, I believe pretty firmly in clarity and understanding - because we can always go BACK from clarity and understanding to immersing ourselves in the art willingly - and if we can do that in art, surely we can do it in our games. I don't believe that finding out a certain painter uses the Golden Ratio to plan out their tableau is going to ruin my appreciation for their paintings. However, if someone else feels differently on this topic, I respect that.<br/><br/>I've even seen designers intentionally omit important parts of their games because they want the players to stumble on the answers themselves and "discover" them. You risk failing altogether, but presumably it's worth it for the ones who get the feeling of "getting it" on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452904/#Comment_452904" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T19:11:07+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  7:11PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 7:23PM by omnifray.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:-<br/><br/>It's a common theme among "narrativist" gamers and storygamers (and I've even done it myself on occasion) to refer to "simulationist" or immersionist games in terms of passivity, or a show put on by the GM. That is accurate only within a very narrow frame of reference, where you assume that the "activity of play" is the active and conscious control of the "narrative" (the active and conscious shaping of the broader events of the game). If you look beyond that narrow frame of reference, what the players in such games are doing is often the epitome of pro-active, energetic gaming. The only thing is that their actions are performed entirely within an in-character mindset, entirely through their characters' agency. Really it is a misconception to assume that this deprives them of influence over the broader events of the game. Generally, in "simulationist" and immersionist games, unless the GM actively railroads the players, it is in fact the players who are driving the "plot" of the game, driving the "narrative", making all the key choices about what the game will focus on - the difference to "narrativist" games being partly that they are not doing this consciously and deliberately, but rather that they are doing it subconsciously or, perhaps it may be more accurate to say, merely <b>incidentally</b> to playing their characters.<br/><br/>The spotlight is always on the player characters. Unless the GM controls where the player characters can go, the spotlight goes where the players choose for their characters to go. The GM is merely a facilitator. It is the players who are exploring.<br/><br/>Let me emphasise again that the problem with the "GM Mystery Cult" is when GMs do not realise that particular players care about impact on the fiction, and want their choices not merely to seem meaningful, but to be meaningful, or when for whatever reason a GM does not respect that autonomy. For a group of players who are not motivated primarily by the opportunity to contribute creatively to the "narrative", the "GM Mystery Cult" is absolutely unproblematical (as long as any necessary illusion is successfully maintained).<br/><br/>"Narrativist" players tend to woefully misunderstand the "mystery-GM" of the "GM Mystery Cult" because of a common facet of human psychology:- our first assumption, until shown otherwise, is that others are like us. Thus, the "narrativist" player assumes that the "mystery-GM" cares about conscious creative control, and the "narrativist" player assumes that the "mystery-GM" knows that the "narrativist" player also cares about conscious creative control, and if you make those two fatally flawed assumptions then you are bound to take great exception to the "manipulative" behaviour of the "mystery-GM". It is all a big misunderstanding between the "narrativist" player who cares about conscious creative control, and the "mystery-GM" who cares about any one or more of atmosphere, character portrayal, immersion, believability, mechanical simulation, investigation and/or exploration.<br/><br/>You refer to the "GM Mystery Cult" being the dominant paradigm of roleplaying as if it were somehow puzzling that that should be so. It is not puzzling. It happens because a lot of people prefer to game that way as players, and thus, when they GM, they assume that other players want the same thing too (because of the very same facet of human psychology that I have mentioned above, that we assume that others are like us unless shown otherwise). I am not saying that the "GM Mystery Cult" is in fact the dominant paradigm, by the way, but I do think that, interpreted in a broad way, it is a very significant and widespread paradigm.<br/><br/>I doubt that many "mystery-GMs" are offended by attempts to create games that pull back the veil, or would be if they understood or knew about them, but they might well be offended by deprecatory and derogatory references to the "GM Mystery Cult" as if it were necessarily a toxic or broken thing.<br/><br/>What is toxic is not the culture of GM-as-Wizard-of-Oz, but rather the collision between the culture of GM-as-Wizard-of-Oz and the smaller movement of RPG-Play-As-Collaborative-Oral-Creative-Writing, when a player desperately wanting the former finds a GM blinkeredly expecting the latter, and neither understands how their motives differ or can be made to work in harmony.<br/><br/>My own view is that once you* understand the problem there is no difficulty finding a place for a person of the newer school in a game GM'd by and for the older school. The answer is the assistant GM's role. Only a hardcore purist of either school will not be willing to make this work once shown how, if it is the only way to get the gaming group to continue in harmony.<br/><br/>* (the impersonal "you", not you personally)<br/><br/>You (now meaning Paul_T again) talk about prioritising a framework for fun, trust and meeting each person's creative interests, but the point is that immersive players (often/mostly?) do not really have creative, so much as experiential interests. That is not to say that they are purely passive; they may drive the game, even with "narrativist" players present. Anyway/also, what is fun for or inspires trust on the part of immersive players may be very different than what is fun for or inspires trust on the part of "narrativist" gamers. <br/><br/>You talk about some people "letting it slide" when the GM lies to them. I think it's worth distinguishing here between illegitimate lies and legitimate lies. If the game text, available to the players, explicitly says that the GM can lie about certain things, and the GM does so, then in the absence of a house-rule to the contrary, and assuming that the players are reasonably likely to have read the rules, I think that's absolutely fine. (NB players can also lie to each other subject to similar reservations.) As for "letting it slide", in line with what I have said upthread, I have had players who have been really upset when I have shown them some of the cogs of the machine; they are not just "letting" lies "slide"; they positively demand them! My assistant GM in a game of Soul's Calling was even quite upset at me for basically openly telling the players (including the assistant GM) at the end of one session that because a particular player, Pete, would be absent from the game the following week, we needed to come up with some in-character reason for Pete's character to be absent too. The problem wasn't that I wanted Pete's character to be absent when Pete was absent (although the players may not necessarily have seen that as being as vital as I thought it was). The problem was that the players wanted me to pull the wool over their eyes so that they (as their real world selves) would not realise the true metagame reason for the absence of the player character, and they were really annoyed at me for pulling back the veil! All or most of the players felt this way including even the assistant GM who I would class as a storygamer. I had had no inkling that they would feel this way, as to me it was just obvious that a player's absence would mean contriving the best excuse we could for the PC's absence, so I wouldn't have expected hiding that from them to have any chance of working.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452905/#Comment_452905" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T19:21:56+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  7:21PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to agree largely with Omnifray's response here. In an immersion focused game it isn't illusionism and it isn't that the GM is Oz, it is that the GM is a facilitator making an honest attempt to emulate a living world. That doesn't mean pure sim. It doesn't mean not fun. It means the players say what they want to do and the GM assess their chances of success then decides what happens (sometimes calling for a roll, sometimes not). When characters interact with NPCs, it is generally in character. The point is to interface with the setting through the perspective of your character...not to simulate your character's personality accurately, not to act out your character's behavior in an oscar worthy performance. It is simply about being in the shoes of the character (and that can include an oscar worthy performance that gets you deep into the head of the PC, but it doesn't have to). Immersion is merely the feeling that you are there. <br/><br/>Immersionists won't be thinking in terms of the fiction or controlling the narrative. They will be thinking in terms of 'what do I want to do now'. <br/><br/>My suspicion is people maybe have an inaccurate impression of what immersion tables really look like in practice (there seems to be a lot of confusing them with railroading and other types of play). <br/><br/>It definitely isn't passive play. Immersion heavy games thrive when the Players take initiative and try to do stuff.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452906/#Comment_452906" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T19:26:50+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  7:26PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2016 7:28PM by omnifray.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>, yes, I share these views, though with the rider that when you say that immersionists won't be "thinking in terms of the fiction", I think you mean that they won't be (deliberately/consciously/frequently) assessing as the game goes along what will make the fiction better or worse; obviously, however, they are hoping to be transported into the fictional world, and so in that sense, the fiction (in the broad sense of "the made-up stuff") becomes their frame of reference for everything (so far as possible).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452909/#Comment_452909" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T20:14:46+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  8:14PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a>, yes, I share these views, though with the rider that when you say that immersionists won't be "thinking in terms of the fiction", I think you mean that they won't be (deliberately/consciously/frequently) assessing as the game goes along what will make the fiction better or worse; obviously, however, they are hoping to be transported into the fictional world, and so in that sense, the fiction (in the broad sense of "the made-up stuff") becomes their frame of reference for everything (so far as possible).</blockquote>\nI meant fiction in the sense of 'narrative', 'story', 'plot', 'themes' etc. Right now I am in the middle of a big formatting project, so I can't give this the attention it probably deserves.

It almost feels like you (omnifray, in this case) are making a case against an argument I have never put forward. (This is understandable in some ways, because it is a common argument - but that's not what I'm saying here.)<br/><br/>I think aiming for an "immersionist" playstyle is completely valid, and I understand the appeal of the in-character experience.<br/><br/>However:<br/><br/>I DO think that, while not all "immersionist" games are necessary railroaded, it's disingenuous to claim that there is no tendency in that direction. The earlier example of "GM suggests to player how they might sway an NPC, then decides the NPC's reaction" is perfect in this context. Yes, it's *possible* to play out a non-railroaded version of that interaction. Will most people, given those tools, however? Not in my experience. At the very least, not acknowledging it as a tendency, I think, is misleading.<br/><br/>However, the only point I was trying to make was that the culture surrounding this style of play encourages misleading or incomplete communication *about the game itself*, and therefore between the players, as well. The need to "maintain the illusion" creates this quite naturally, as you yourself say.<br/><br/>When this is entirely consensual, there's nothing wrong with it. However, speaking for my own personal preferences, much like I wouldn't want my partner to fake their pleasure with me, I don't want to go in this direction with my gaming. The pitfalls - particularly the long-term erosion of trust - are just too large and too omnipresent.<br/><br/>A subtler but perhaps less stark drawback is the inability to even talk about the game, whether for pleasure, or to make it better! I really enjoy discussing the game with my friends, and not being able to do so is just terribly disappointing. If I ask for help to contrive a reason why Bill's character won't be present next session, and the players cover the ears and start chanting their immersion-protection mantra, I've just been abandoned in a difficult position by my friends, and I'm <i>not even allowed to ask for help</i>. Sure, it's a mild thing in this case, and well within the purview of my GM duties, but it's still an example of a (very mildly) socially dysfunctional dynamic. <br/><br/>Similarly, if I'm a player and I don't like what's happening to my character (let's say it triggers some prior trauma I have, or something equally unpleasant), I'm now fighting an upstream battle against our culture of play to say anything at all - to protect my own emotional state, I have to "break the illusion", which is an extra barrier to my speaking up at all. A barrier (in this case) to my enjoying the game instead of being hurt by it (since I'll likely get some kickback from the group for at least momentarily ruining the game).<br/><br/>In short, I very much *like* the immersionist style of play, and would happily engage in it with people I like and trust. But I see it as carrying a lot of baggage which can cause real problems, and the unspoken taboo against discussing things openly creates difficulties - if not today, if not tomorrow, then someday...<br/><br/>It has NOTHING to do with "Narrativist priorities" or a power struggle between players with different expectations. The in-game behaviour (nicely summarized by Brendan, above) is fun, solid, and great. It's the culture <i>around</i> the game itself which I find stifling (and in every group where I've seen it in action, it has led to problems).<br/><br/>Surely a bunch of people who are capable of rolling dice, calculating attack percentages, counting experience points, and imagining their GM as a 3"-tall pixie speaking in sub-human hearing range song magic - without <i>any</i> of that ruining their "immersion"! - can be mature enough to disconnect from the illusion for a minute and have a chat about how to deal with Bob's absence from the next session? <br/><br/>Or are they really so self-deluded about the nature of what they are doing that they *wouldn't notice* that Bob's character was very specifically missing only from events which took place on Tuesday night, when they were playing at Jenny's house, but not the events of the following week, when playing at Bob's house? To the point where just <i>my bringing it up</i> ruins the game for them?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452919/#Comment_452919" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T03:16:53+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  3:16AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually have a pretty interesting thought experiment related to this topic, which I will post separately, in case readers more sensible than we (who have presumably long abandoned this thread!) would like to contribute. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Here it is:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20639/omniscient-gaming-a-game-thought-experiment-that-was-a-real-game" rel="nofollow">Link</a><br/><br/>Question:<br/><br/>If you were offered a chance to adopt this system for the campaign you're running, would you?

From my experience, immersionist are pretty sour on railroads. The whole point is to be in the shoes of the character, which means if I suddenly want to go west to Donyra and set up a wheat emporium, I'm pretty much free to do so. I've very rarely been in a group where this is the predominant style and you end up going through a path set forth by the GM. <br/><br/>Even if you are just looking at discrete interactions with things like NPCs, the whole point against is to play the NPCs as you would a PC (a full character with goals and motivations). There isn't a single path to victory in an interaction with an NPC just like there isn't a single path to victory in interactions in real life. As a GM I am not sitting there guiding the PCs responses, my NPC is just reacting to what they say and do.

I agree that it would perk curiousity if that was the name of the game. It should have a rather ambivalent market image, too, so when the GM puts the game text on the table you still don't really know what it's about. Is it a fantasy game? A thriller? Who knows!<br/><br/>The actual game would maybe be set up like a mystery cult, too, with the GM as the high priest and the players as supplicants attempting to initiate into the mysteries. Occasionally there is fictional material in there, except is it a fiction or is it a doctrine, and it's mostly in the form of self-encapsulated initiation exercises that seem to almost, but not quite, link to each other. It would be a glorious mess of blended fiction as you're supposedly playing this game, within which you're supposedly joining a mystery cult, within which you're being initiated into the secrets of being a game master. Is it a game, is it a learning exercise, is it a cult? Who knows!<br/><br/>At the end you get a diploma certifying successful completion of the course, entitling you to call yourself a GM of the 1st degree. At the back of the game text there's a chart of the organization of the cult, rising the lofty heights of 33rd degree grandmastery, all available to those willing to become seekers of truth in the... <i>GM Mystery Cult</i>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452936/#Comment_452936" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T09:48:57+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  9:48AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always felt games should do more to train (or enable) players in the GM arts to proliferate table-top gaming, which is often reliant on a word-of-mouth pedagogy. <br/><br/>Perhaps <i>GM Mystery Cult</i> players have characters that are themselves GMs for imagined groups. <i>"... roll 2d4 to see how many players turn up this week."</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452937/#Comment_452937" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T10:07:10+00:00" title="May  4, 2016 10:07AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that makes sense - and you have itty-bitty character sheets for the imaginary players, but no particular stats or such for the GM, because the GM is you.<br/><br/>In fact, the whole thing needs to be a sort of a managerial meta-game where you design and implement rpg campaign projects, starting from choosing a game and the player base, and ending with successful or not so successful execution.

Compared to a game of Shared-Narrative-Authority-Collaborative-Oral-Creative-Writing, obviously, an immersionist game has a higher chance of ending up as a railroad, because railroading is impossible in the former type of game, and not necessarily entirely anathema to the latter type of game. However, I stand by the assertion that railroading is generally (not always) a sign of a defect in GMing (which is not to say that the GM in question has GMed poorly in every respect; it may be an isolated defect in his GMing). Moreover, you are much likelier to see railroading in a heavily tactical game of, say, D&amp;D 4e where the game moves from fight to fight along an almost pre-planned path, rather than in an immersive game. A sandboxy style of gaming is a big thing for many immersive gamers (not all). So to say that there is a "tendency" of immersive games to result in railroading is... contentious to say the least. There may be an element of truth in it, but as a sweeping proposition it is liable to mislead.\n<blockquote>A subtler but perhaps less stark drawback is the inability to even talk about the game, whether for pleasure, or to make it better! </blockquote>\nThis can be a real drawback but it is the price inherent in striving to ensure (for the sake of immersion) that the players' knowledge of the fictional elements of the game is limited to the knowledge their characters would have. I am not sure whether you are classing this as a matter of culture rather than the essence of playing an immersive game, but it is not merely a matter of culture. Whilst it is not universal or inevitable that player knowledge of the fiction will always be limited to the character's knowledge in a heavily immersive game, striving to limit a player's knowledge of the fiction to what the character would know is an important technique of immersion. When you adopt that technique, the price you pay is inherent in it.<br/><br/>The worst example of this sort of drawback is when someone suspects that someone else (GM or player) is unfairly victimising their character for out-of-game reasons and the supposed bully cannot explain their in-game reasons adequately without spoiling the game for everyone. This is especially problematic when the supposed victim does not understand the need for secrecy and the supposed bully does not understand that the supposed victim is, perhaps, not an immersive gamer. It is also complicated by notions of fair play among tactically minded gamers. This problem does happen; I have seen it on numerous occasions, broadly speaking from both sides of the fence. The answer to this is to learn to (and perhaps have the maturity to) trust your fellow gamers to GM/play the game in good faith, and to game with decent people who aren't out to vent out-of-game frustrations on your character. And to have the maturity not to care too much if it turns out that some fellow gamer of yours is indeed so cretinous as to use the game as pay-back for something out-of-game.\n<blockquote>I really enjoy discussing the game with my friends, and not being able to do so is just terribly disappointing. If I ask for help to contrive a reason why Bill's character won't be present next session, and the players cover the ears and start chanting their immersion-protection mantra, I've just been abandoned in a difficult position by my friends, and I'm <i>not even allowed to ask for help</i>. Sure, it's a mild thing in this case, and well within the purview of my GM duties, but it's still an example of a (very mildly) socially dysfunctional dynamic. </blockquote>\nWhat's dysfunctional here is that your friends are prepared to pay a higher price than you are for the sake of maximal immersion, and/or their experience of immersion is more sensitive than yours is to disruption. Suck it up! In the actual case where this happened to me when I was GMing, the other thing is that a GM's perspective into the players' immersion is necessarily imperfect, because the GM doesn't get to experience the same depth of immersion as the players and isn't always as conscious of that experience as the players are.\n<blockquote>The in-game behaviour (nicely summarized by Brendan, above) is fun, solid, and great. It's the culture <i>around</i> the game itself which I find stifling (and in every group where I've seen it in action, it has led to problems).</blockquote>\nI do not think that you can separate the culture from the essence of the game in this way. What you perceive as culture surrounding the game is the result of a set of techniques preferred by some immersive gamers so as to achieve maximal immersion. To abandon that culture is to abandon those techniques. There may be other ways of achieving immersion, but the level of immersion achieved may suffer as a result of foregoing some techniques. Immersive gamers are not oblivious to the difficulties in striving for immersion; but it is so much fun, that the problems are a price worth paying.\n<blockquote>Surely a bunch of people who are capable of rolling dice, calculating attack percentages, counting experience points, and imagining their GM as a 3"-tall pixie speaking in sub-human hearing range song magic - without <i>any</i> of that ruining their "immersion"! - can be mature enough to disconnect from the illusion for a minute and have a chat about how to deal with Bob's absence from the next session? </blockquote>\nYou are entirely wrong to think that this is a matter of maturity. Immersion is a subjective experience and what lets a particular person experience immersion has very little (if anything) to do with maturity.\n<blockquote>Even if you are just looking at discrete interactions with things like NPCs, the whole point against is to play the NPCs as you would a PC (a full character with goals and motivations). There isn't a single path to victory in an interaction with an NPC just like there isn't a single path to victory in interactions in real life. As a GM I am not sitting there guiding the PCs responses, my NPC is just reacting to what they say and do. If they are sufficiently engaged, it usually leads somewhere interesting (though more often than not, not in directions or with conclusions I ever anticipated). </blockquote>\nI agree with you that the GM's task or method is (generally speaking) to play the NPC in a similar way to a player playing a PC (as a full character with goals and motivations), although I would tolerate exceptions to that on a case-by-case basis because what matters most to me is the players' experience. I agree, for sure, that there isn't a single path to victory in an interaction with an NPC. In fairness to Paul_T, the notion of the GM giving some guidance to assist a particular player is a notion that I introduced into the conversation (even if some analogy can be drawn to the AW "reading" move, up to a certain point). That's a very infrequent feature of my GMing; more often what I am willing to do is to bias the way I roleplay an NPC in the players' favour or against them, depending on a social stats roll (and/or give factual info). There's no iron rule that as a GM for an immersive group I must roleplay the NPC purely as feels most natural to me without any distortion. But I certainly would not be sitting there giving a player a prompt every 10 seconds as to what to say next, and running the whole conversation from the GM seat. I think maybe I have given Paul_T a slightly exaggerated impression of how my social stats rules are supposed to work, because really I would regard a situation where the GM is effectively playing both sides of a conversation between a PC and an NPC as a catastrophic failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452946/#Comment_452946" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T16:06:09+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  4:06PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In fact, the whole thing needs to be a sort of a managerial meta-game where you design and implement rpg campaign projects, starting from choosing a game and the player base, and ending with successful or not so successful execution.

It doesn't seem <i>to me</i> that this style of gaming would be impossible to accomplish while removing some of the "culture of play" surrounding this type of game. However, until I've done it successfully myself, I can't really say much to back that up. <br/><br/>Overall, it comes down, for me, to a difference in attitude: <br/><br/>* I've had a lot more fun and healthy, functional gaming with people who take the approach that a game is a fun, social, creative activity between equals. <br/><br/>* I've seen a lot more problems in the other paradigm, where gaming is seen, rather, as <i>an experience</i>, which is <i>provided</i> by one person to a group of participants. Much like my earlier (crude) sexual metaphor, I tend to see long-term problems arising from that culture and that mindset. At some level, it requires deception and intentional obfuscation which can bleed over into social interaction and into the trust between the people involved.<br/><br/>In the end, for me it's a question of personal preference, but I do have plans someday to explore this further with different mixes of people!

It isn't like we're sitting there not allowing anyone to speak out of character with the intensity of an ISIS recruit. It is a game, and while the focus will tend to be on in-character play, it is never a problem to break that to ask a question about anything (whether the question is about something in the game or to request something in the game not be addressed). If someone is having problems at the table, I would view that as a personal matter between them and who they are gaming with (a discussion to be had before, during or after the game). I don't think you can blame immersion for that. Certainly if you find playing in immersionist games, for whatever reason, makes you uncomfortable, then you shouldn't do so. But I haven't seen any instances of people having a problem because of immersion. </blockquote>\nI've read before about LARPers using gestures and keywords to signal other players they are having some problems, thus avoiding to interrupt the flow, You can also use cards and point at them at specific moment in the game to signal the GM to throw a veil over an scene. These are simple safety measures easy to implement and started as a response to a problematic, a real problem that has already been mentioned here on SG, on other places, LARPs and which I've experienced myself a couple of times.<br/><br/>I think I mentioned it before: too sensitive people can get lost in their character immersion or handle poorly another player's involvement in their own immersion. It seems to be particularily common among the public your game is aiming to, Omnifray. <br/><br/>In my particular case, it happened mainly when I started roleplaying, as I wrongly assumed that every player was as much deeply immersed in their characters as me. I got quite angry at another player because he killed another PC because of a miscalculation, but his reaction to the whole deal was totally disconnected from his character. It was on the lines of "OOops! I killed the paladin? ... well, how much XP do I get from that?". Everyone laughed, but for me it was like a dear comrade had fallen and the culprit was acting unrepented and non-chalantly as if it wasn't his fault. I wnet trying to punish him, but the GM rushed the scene, the session ended and I was denied any chance of intervention.<br/><br/>I calmed later, got to know the player a lot more (we weren't so familiar by that time) and surprisingly found out that his real self wasn't at all like this. For him, this all was just a game that he could enjoy without immersing into the character, but into other parts of the game. I eventually learned a bit of that from him, and while I kinda still get into character here and there, this and the chance of character death still keep me from immersing too deeply, since otherwise that would get me a bit more emotional than I need to properly enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Another case I saw is from another close friend of mine. Prior to what he said, I never had any problem as a GM impersonating female NPCs, immersing in character and even engaging in romantic or sexual situations with PCs when it suited the story. For me there was a good source of motivations for PCs and good story twists in such characters and situations. However eventually this friend of mine confessed me that seeing me and other GMs do that actually broke and ruined his immersion. It doesn't even have to do with an actual trauma or homophobia, it's just that he can't focus when seeing us acting as other people from the opposite sex. I ended up apologizing to him for many scenes I had put him through without knowing this, and have avoided going there as much as possible ever since. I've even warned other players not to go there for his sake and kept asking new players how they feel about this particular before thinking of using NPCs that way.<br/><br/>In another more recent case, a GM which we've been playing with has been including so much innuendo and sexual jokes on our sessions, imposing sexual situations on our characters that we ended up speaking to him and asking to cut it off a little, specially because my girlfriend's character got irresistibly drawn into an orgy with some demigods, which most of the rest of the PCs avoided narrowly due to good will saves. She took it on the good side and while we still laughed at it (ok, she laugh, two of us just smiled uncomfortably and the fourth one just throwed up his arms on the air and raised his hands resigned to his fate) we had to talk it with the GM at the end of the session. He was allright with the changes and while we still have to see how well he fares on the next session, he's always been honorable, so we consider the matter settled.<br/><br/>So, as you can see, things have been solved by talking on every case, but that didn't stopped the bad experience from happening, and we have to consider that the people we're taking about here were totally reasonable, talkative, considerate and tend to take things on the good side (me included, even considering I'm somewhat sensitive to some things), which isn't often the case with every group of players.<br/><br/>So, immersion safety rules aren't there <i>because things will go badly</i> (even when I might appear to be stating that they will), they are there to help players build confidence and trust, so I believe they should receive a good amount of consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452963/#Comment_452963" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T23:16:21+00:00" title="May  4, 2016 11:16PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About the particular of character immersionist games being railroady... well one thing shouldn't actually follow the other, Im pretty sure there are lots of groups playing it differently. But the idea of the two things going together isn't totally a myth and giving it some thought it's reasonable that it happens a lot.<br/><br/>You see, the human brain has a limit to the amount of things it can deal with at once. Even when some stuff is processed at different levels, order and speed, it's not like we can play 3.5 D&amp;D <i>using all the rules</i>, right? Some GMs would ditch encumbrance rules, use fixed damage instead of rolling it, roll for initiative once instead of doing it each round, exchange some rules for their own homebrew version, etc etc. We can however mix perfectly a still large amount of rules with minis, because spatial tactics are handled by a different part of the brain. On top of that our numeric abstraction may be fast enough to also deal with number crunching along this, or perhaps just do it when leveling your character up. There's a part of our brain also working to keep the story coherent in our perspective. And then there's character immersion, which engages another entire different part of our brain.<br/><br/>So, how much can actually our brain deal with when roleplaying? There must me some more serious studies somewhere about this, but I think all things listed abowe are enough to make you doubt a player or GM can engage with all this stuff at once. They will probably deal with things in different moments, be better at some and worse at others, manipulate the situations a bit until the part where they can shine comes ("I draw my axe and attack!" -"Shut up, we're about to talk things off!") or just limp through it for the group's sake. They may leave making a coherent story up to the GM "because he's better at coming up with stuff", or leave roleplaying to the dice "because the GM is better at acting". None of this things means one type of player is more passive than others. They may be perfectly proactive in one aspect or another, but people focused on one specific thing may feel that people not focused on the same thing are playing the game <i>wrong</i>, or perhaps just not enjoying it enough.<br/><br/>So basically, while character immersion may not be for everyone, character immersive players aren't neccessarily passive, nor story gamers may be as active as they thought, nor rollplayers might be enjoying the game in the wrong way or less than anyone does, it's just different mindframes applied to the same activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452964/#Comment_452964" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T23:16:54+00:00" title="May  4, 2016 11:16PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2016 6:03PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452965/#Comment_452965" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T23:17:19+00:00" title="May  4, 2016 11:17PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2016 6:03PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452966/#Comment_452966" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T23:19:20+00:00" title="May  4, 2016 11:19PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2016 6:03PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crap, sorry everyone!

In a LARP that is a physical activity where people are fully in character and you can see how people could get injured or have stuff happen where they are not okay with things. A game where people are immersed, as I've tried to point out, isn't about losing touch with reality and not paying attention to other things. I mean, you do get a certain sense of being the character, but you are still at a table where people are eating potato chips. It isn't Mazes and Monsters. <br/><br/>In terms of things coming up in play that people are uncomfortable with. I think every group is different and deals with these things in their own ways. There is also local culture to consider. But immersion itself isn't something that I see creating problems like this in my own games. I am not suggesting you haven't experienced issues, just that I think problems tend to me more an extension of personalities at the table than play styles. <br/><br/>Right now I game with friends, and in the Boston area. I think for us, having special signals or safe words would feel a little strange. My group wouldn't go for that sort of thing. t think we are a lot more direct about that stuff (if someone has a problem they'll usually say so, if me or someone else in the group senses an issue, we'll ask about it). Of course it isn't a public game, it is among people who have played together for some time. Usually when I start an additional game with new people, or bring new folks into my current campaign, I talk with them before and after play (mainly to find out how our play style fits them but also to see if there are any issues). <br/><br/>Ultimately I think this stuff is up to the group though and not the ruleset. I wouldn't tell people not to use a safe word, but I think I might react a little quizzically if a rulebook insisted upon the practice. \n<blockquote>About the particular of character immersionist games being railroady... well one thing shouldn't actually follow the other, Im pretty sure there are lots of groups playing it differently. But the idea of the two things going together isn't totally a myth and giving it some thought it's reasonable that it happens a lot.</blockquote>\nI understand that, but I think this is a case where there just isn't a connection. I mean the least railroady games I've been in have been with people who value immersion. I think they tend to avoid railroad for the reasons I cited before. Also a lot of folks who are into immersion were put off by some of the railroady things going on in games during the 90s, so I think there is a natural resistance to it there as well. If people are coming away with the impression that immersion and railroads are related, I think they may not have much experience with it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453005/#Comment_453005" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T00:24:39+00:00" title="May  6, 2016 12:24AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2016 12:34AM by omnifray.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I see a number of drawbacks to this style of gaming (even while I find the gaming itself to be quite appealing, for the most part). It doesn't seem <i>to me</i> that this style of gaming would be impossible to accomplish while removing some of the "culture of play" surrounding this type of game. </blockquote>\nDefinitely not impossible to accomplish without some of these common elements that you refer to as "culture of play", but might be more difficult to accomplish and/or there might be some players who it absolutely wouldn't work for, whereas others it would.\n<blockquote>* I've had a lot more fun and healthy, functional gaming with people who take the approach that a game is a fun, social, creative activity between equals. </blockquote>\nBut Paul, you just don't seem to be able to escape your pro-"indie" assumptions. Immersive gaming can be fun, healthy, functional gaming with people who take the approach that a game is a fun, social activity (and possibly a creative activity) between equals. Let's zoom in on the phrase "between equals". When I GM it is often for very close friends of mine. I have no urge, desire or ambition to be their petty overlord, ruling over their social world; on the contrary, in some sense, when I am GMing, I am their bitch, in the sense that I am doing a great deal of work so that we can all have fun together. In reality, socially, we are all absolutely equals. I would be absolutely delighted for any of them to be GMing instead of me (provided they can make a decent job of it). The social structure imposed by the game is really just a set of conventions permitting the game to progress efficiently in line with commonly shared goals. They as equals delegate to me certain functions of ruling on aspects of the game. I can give those rulings only because they have delegated that function to me. I do not impose it on them from on high. It just strikes me as some kind of weird fantasy to think of the GM as enjoying genuine social power or social superiority over his friends in a tabletop gaming environment. In large LARP systems there may be exceptions to this, but in a tabletop game, the fact that you run the game with military efficiency by having a single decision-maker for questions of the rules --- is just a rule of convenience for everyone's benefit. Any hint that a person was abusing that role to jockey for position in the group socially, would simply cast them as a giant a-hole.<br/><br/>As for the creativity part:- Bella Martin in (at least one of) her book(s) on Stanislavsky speaks of "dual consciousness" (i.e. immersion in character in the way actors do it) as if it were part and parcel of the creativity inherent in acting. I'm not talking about the conscious, deliberate kind of creativity of RPG-As-Collective-Oral-Creative-Writing Shared-Narrative-Authority games, but a more instinctual form of expression that could be referred to as creativity.\n<blockquote>* I've seen a lot more problems in the other paradigm, where gaming is seen, rather, as <i>an experience</i>, which is <i>provided</i> by one person to a group of participants.</blockquote>\nFacilitated for, rather than provided to.<br/><br/>But the problems don't stem from having a single GM providing the experience. The occasional social problems (misunderstandings) stem from people keeping in-game secrets so as to helpfully preserve each other's immersion. The problems can equally arise from players keeping secrets from other players. The problems could equally arise in a GMless game where conflicts are resolved by table vote and one group of players might be keeping some secrets secret from another player or players. This has nothing directly to do with the GM's authority. It's to do with secret-keeping, a feature of gaming that I personally highly value, but which has nothing to do with power relationships arising out of GMing-based hierarchies.<br/><br/>Sure, I suppose, problems can arise when a GM botches the GMing role by giving poor rulings, but that's not confined to immersive games; it applies equally whenever anyone has to give a ruling that someone else finds annoying. Maybe, if the rulings are given by table vote, they have more social legitimacy and are easier to accept despite the fact that you don't personally like them; sometimes, in GMed games, if a player doesn't like a ruling they will try to appeal to the authority of the group. But table votes slow things down. Individual decision-making is quicker. That's a big plus.\n<blockquote>Another case I saw is from another close friend of mine. Prior to what he said, I never had any problem as a GM impersonating female NPCs, immersing in character and even engaging in romantic or sexual situations with PCs when it suited the story. For me there was a good source of motivations for PCs and good story twists in such characters and situations. However eventually this friend of mine confessed me that seeing me and other GMs do that actually broke and ruined his immersion. It doesn't even have to do with an actual trauma or homophobia, it's just that he can't focus when seeing us acting as other people from the opposite sex. I ended up apologizing to him for many scenes I had put him through without knowing this, and have avoided going there as much as possible ever since. I've even warned other players not to go there for his sake and kept asking new players how they feel about this particular before thinking of using NPCs that way.</blockquote>\nI do encourage people to play characters of the gender they identify with and not the opposite gender to that. Likewise when I am GMing my ideal is to have a female player acting as deputy GM so that she can take on some of the female NPC roles. That view of mine has attracted some criticism in the past but stuff it, the fact is that me pretending to be a dainty princess or even Brienne of Tarth is not going to convince anyone for very long.<br/><br/>Interestingly people tend to find "cross-play" much more objectionable in LARPs, presumably because LARPs are so frequently so much more immersive than tabletop to start with, so anything that spoils immersion in LARPs is immediately more noticeable than the same thing would be in tabletop where immersion is frequently relatively speaking shakier.\n<blockquote>So, immersion safety rules aren't there <i>because things will go badly</i> (even when I might appear to be stating that they will), they are there to help players build confidence and trust, so I believe they should receive a good amount of consideration.</blockquote>\nBut the more the players are forced to think constantly about each other's comfort zones and to roleplay with kid gloves, the more that in itself distracts them from simply roleplaying their characters, and hence ruins their immersion. I encourage players to just go nuts as their characters and let the GM try and handle any fall-out. Between sessions may be another matter but sharing of information about the fiction with a player should be avoided if at all possible unless his character would know it.

interesting how "cross-play" (a non-male playing a male, or a non-elf playing an elf, or whatnot) is viewed as undesirable by Omni for immersive purposes. In discussions with Finnish immersionist gamers I've generally found that they tend to share a sort of liberal progressivist agenda that encourages opportunities to immerse in "the Other", holding it as one of the major benefits of the rpg hobby. I've only ever seen cross-play considered problematic by a few trad gamers here and there (as opposed to "immersionists", who are considered a distinct school or tradition by now).<br/><br/>This probably goes back to how immersion seems to be a more polarized issue in the Nordic scene than in some other places, due to the way it became an early and central point of distinction for freeformers and larpers in opposition to trad gamers. Such tends to foster cohesion of thought, and in this matter the cohesion seems to have favoured cross-play, making the opposite viewpoint somewhat exotic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453042/#Comment_453042" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T19:46:57+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  7:46PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually thought cross-playing to be perfectly normal since I started playing RPGs and didn't even joke at players doing it until my friend told me about it ruining his immersion. He learned to play RPGs with us so I'd say for us it's not a matter of a cultural difference, but more about a personal one. <br/><br/>And Onmifray, you can minimize as much as you want all the problems we have mentioned along the thread, but that doesn't make them dissapear. Some of us would still be as skeptical about carefree immersionist gameplay always going allright, as you are of trad gameplay being a nice enough way to achieve immersion for both roleplayers and rollplayers. We both know that both things are achievable, but will certailnly distrust any method of achieving it consistently until all details of such methods are properly explained.<br/><br/>So far your game sounds interesting, I hope you end up explaying it well enough that a player/GM like me would understand what you mean well enough to explain it to other players not familiar with the joys of character immersion. More than that, I really do hope your method is good enough that doesn't generate the side effects of uncontrolled charater immersion we have mentioned before, thus making safety measures unnecessary.  I'll bow out of the discussion, since it seems there isn't too much else to discuss that will help anyone. Best luck with your game, hope we can read it soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453045/#Comment_453045" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-07T00:20:14+00:00" title="May  7, 2016 12:20AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2016 12:26AM by omnifray.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, in my (perhaps in this respect narrow) experience the counterimmersive nature of cross-play is more (rather than less) of an issue in LARP than in tabletop:- what I am thinking of is for instance how in my favourite foam-sword LARP, people make comments like "let's hope Jemima turns up to monster otherwise the witch at the end of section 1 is going to be Smithy in a dress" (both the girl "Jemima" and the fat balding 40-year-old man "Smithy" are hypothetical individuals i.e. names have been changed to protect the guilty, but the general idea is the same) - and the tone / sense of humour used clearly implies that "Smithy" is not going to be very convincing in drag... what we tend to do in that LARP is to fit our perception of the fictional character to our perception of the real-world player as closely as possible, so that for instance our elves can indeed be fat, balding and ungainly (though the players do wear face paint - Snazaroo generally), and we don't have horses or dragons in the foam-sword environment... for tabletop RPG purposes I personally find it fairly easy to overlook "crossplay" crossing lines of race (such as human versus beastmanlike faerie) as long as the race played is humanoid; currently I am playing a female horse as a PC and whilst I hesitate to say that playing a female faerie horse is more of an issue than playing a male horse, I reserve judgement pending further play experience! But definitely the fact of the horse being a horse is more of a potential issue than the fact of it being a faerie. Anyway I feel uncomfortable playing female humanoid characters as PCs and whilst I will happily play them as NPCs while GMing I do not claim to do 100% justice to the female psyche in my roleplay, as it is quite different to the male and not easy to faithfully imitate.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, I accept that there can be problems that are more characteristic of immersive roleplay than of other forms of roleplay; I have not sought to deny that. Perhaps though I have "minimised" them, but only insofar as I think that some of the posts other people have made upthread have given an exaggerated impression of them, or have made generalised sweeping statements going further than was justified. I am not saying that carefree immersionist roleplay always goes to plan - I am far from saying that. And I am certainly not saying that OSR-type gaming cannot lead to immersion. (I use "trad" in a far broader sense than "OSR-type gaming", so broad in fact that I class pretty much any RPG as "trad" unless it has significant shared narrative authority; to me, a foam-sword LARP is basically "trad"; but that's terminological / semantics; the important point is that I do not mean to say that games with 10' poles and orcs can never be immersive).<br/><br/>My game will generate social side effects of uncontrolled character immersion, precisely because it encourages uncontrolled character immersion, subject only to the supervision of the GM / assistant GM (who may be able to save the day if necessary, but equally may not), and to the responsibility of players to think about the needs of the game between sessions (but not really so much during play). It's not that I think that the game wouldn't be socially safer with safety measures - of course it would. It's just that I think that a little social conflict is a price worth paying for a maximally immersive experience.<br/><br/>So yeah, sure, considering shared narrative authority games of collective collaborative oral creative writing run according to table consensus (and especially if run without a GM), those games, compared to hardcore games of full-on unrestrained immersive roleplay, will probably tend to be more socially harmonious, because of the transparency and openness encouraged by the set-up. But those shared narrative authority games just don't hit quite the same spot for me as the full-on unrestrained immersive games. I kind of have an expectation that gamers will toughen up and take it on the chin when the game riles them up a bit. I find those games more exciting. Other people get a huge creative buzz out of shared narrative authority games; I generally don't. Who can say if one person's buzz is buzzier than another's? But I know what gives me the biggest buzz and it comes at a modest price of gaming with the occasional prima donna who might have a bit of a tantrum due to some perceived slight that was actually justified for in-game reasons that you just can't explain to the prima donna because it would mean sharing secrets. It's partly a question of priorities and it depends critically on subjective individual factors and personal individual psychology.<br/><br/>Now addressing the general reader if anyone reading this is interested (not addressing any particular poster with the following comments), I think if you've never had that immersive buzz to the level I'm talking about, and you're curious about it from reading my long and rambling rants on the matter (sorry!), the easiest way to get it for the first time is probably by trying a variety of different LARP games and some freeform tabletop RP with a strong GM. But no advice will work for everyone. Some people find "elves" portrayed by fat men in green costumes with plastic bows, or "vampires" in goth clothes with plastic fangs trying to pull emo girls, so offputting that it ruins any chance of immersion for them. It depends what your buttons are. But for me personally it was LARP that did the most to open my eyes to experiences that I was only later able to mimic in a tabletop environment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453324/#Comment_453324" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-16T20:45:46+00:00" title="May 16, 2016  8:45PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having done some ("boffer") LARP, and enjoyed it, it was also one of the least immersive RPG experiences I've ever had.

Actually I would say it's a common element of dozens on dozens of games going back to the 1980s. I'm not sure how effective it is or isn't. On the one hand, shifting D&amp;D players to being open to other games has been a mug's game so far, so perhaps you lose nothing by aggressively pursuing those who actively dislike D&amp;D.  On the other hand, if you can't shift them maybe your resentment is unfounded - you're just not making as good a game as D&amp;D.  On the other other hand, nobody seems to read the instructions for RPGs anyway, so why not put whatever godawful stupid garbage you want in there?

But, man, trying to sell My Life With Master as a product for D&amp;D players sounds like a headache.  So, yeah, teenagers!  Find a way!<br/><br/>Do you think the 300-page book preference is inherited from D&amp;D, or do you think it applies to total newcomers too?  Maybe, as counter-intuitive as it may be to pay $40 for some big book that calls itself a game, paying $20 for some little book that calls itself a game is even weirder?</blockquote>\nAs a publisher, I can say that the marketing challenge is totally doable. I mean, RPGs are the best games fueled by imagination; provide enough material to keep players going, or just pointers for players to find more reference material and you're done. The product is great; what you need to do is make it more accesible. You must think of the worst case scenario of course, that you're selling it to people who:<br/><br/>-Doesn't read too much or doesn't want to read too much to play.<br/>-Isn't familiar with other systems, techniques or procedures from any roleplaying game.<br/>-Will definitely feel cheated if you explain that they will need more than one book from your collection or some hard to find props to play (like d20 dice in my country).<br/>-Definitely don't want to deal with too much math nor complicate game mechanics.<br/>-Doesn't have too much time to invest in this hobby (YET, perhaps once you get them interested they will make some sime)<br/><br/>And at the same time, to people who do, which is easy if you put some more optional rules. So you need streamlined or minimalistic mechanics, quite well explained. You need to convey a lot of info in the least space possible -for which I believe comics are the best: a lot of the techniques are more easily explained through visual AP examples. You need to make prep really short, fun and an integral part of the session, so the DM doesn't have to spend time out of the session and people can start playing right away. You need to keep the amount of mechanics to the minimum possible and recycle them to solve anything that could come up in the game.<br/><br/>For the rest, the actual culture is already there. You can perfectly sell this as a formalized way of "play pretend" and every single person in the globe will get what you mean, everything else, they will acquire it through playing.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nWhich btw, comes from my experience publishing and selling my own RPG in a country almost totally unfamiliar with RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454053/#Comment_454053" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T16:58:41+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  4:58PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think you nailed it.<br/><br/>Marketing to the disenfranchised in a way only they can understand is indeed a big part of it.

I think the big problem is that a lot of the marketing remains directed "inward" - gamers try to recruit other gamers to play their games (and this sort of word-of-mouth recruitment is basically the only "marketing" most indie RPGs have) and the gamers they are trying to recruit are either A) Invested in/content with D&amp;D and disinclined to change or <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> People who dissatisfied with D&amp;D and want to change.  I guess there is also category C) People who aren't dissatisfied, but like variety in their lives, but this category seems to be a minority.<br/><br/>So the major problem with indie games is that they lack the "oomf" to make a marketing push to people who aren't gamers, so are stuck with essentially fighting with/cannibalizing D&amp;D.  Which, in addition to not being that effective, is what breeds the cultural backlash - becaus these games are viewed as "stealing" gamers from D&amp;D.  Which is not entirely unfair, because let's face it, people DO have to choose which games they play, and if you decide you want to play indie games once a week, that may very well come at the cost of your longstanding D&amp;D game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454075/#Comment_454075" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T18:49:59+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  6:49PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The goal of The Forge was the publication of independent titles. Not sure if profit was a priority, but having as many independent publishers as possible was. That's antithetical to producing a single game system which everyone agrees to advocate for.<br/><br/>And the accessibility issue is weird because technically Indie titles are far more accessible than typical Trad titles like D&amp;D or Pathfinder which value multiple books with high page counts. And yet those remain the most popular titles by a wide margin. Worse, art and page count have become almost directly proportional to how much current gamers consider an RPG book to be worth. So while your game may be complete in 100 pages, it still won't be seen as a better value than a book three times its size full of filler.<br/><br/>There's a set of expectations in the current RPG market which Indie titles will just not penetrate, so it's best to look elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454092/#Comment_454092" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T21:50:14+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  9:50PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, accessibility isn't just about page count, it's about how the game is explained to people, about how many concepts, techniques and mechanics you need to teach them and they need to internalize before being able to play and enjoy the game in the same way the designer envisioned, and how much time do they need to do that and prepare for that.<br/><br/>I owned a copy of the Anima Beyond Fantasy rpg, a (more or less) complete game in a single book, 350 page long more or less. The game setting, premise and PC skills were awesome, but the system was so highly detailed that even with previous experience in roleplaying and GMing, we couldn't play it RAW even though we tried. We ended up hacking and mixing it with several other indie games. <br/><br/>The game isn't actually too bad, it's just complex, even unnecessarily complex for some players. and then getting familiar enough with the setting and system is no easy task for a newbie player. Most probably, newbie players could get scared away from tabletop RPGs if they thought they were all like these.<br/><br/>Then you have the GM role, which in itself seems to deal with tons of responsability and a work of patience, since players may not need system mastery but you definitely need to achieve it and on top of it, come up with creative original material for each session. Newbies often take that role out of necessity more than out of vocation, unless they get enough inspired by APs or previous experiences as a player, with a GM that knows his trade.<br/><br/>You also have to make a game accessible to people of different skillsets than the designer. A designer with better math skills than the media and a lack of sensibility for people with different skills will often lose himself on mathematical intricacies of the system, making it somewhat unaccessible to people without math skills. Outgoing designers will make games which get the best out of their personality without considering how introverted players could possibly cope trying to play it without enough developed social skills. <br/><br/>And notice that we aren't actually discussing tastes. I'm no mathemathician but I could grasp what ABF was about and I could totally play it, except that it would take me a lot of time at first until I get over the learning curve, not to mention I'll have to help my players up that learning curve too. And I would do that because the game actually fits my tastes in genre, detail and more... except that I also happen to have skills at designing and hacking games, so I prefered to change the game instead of facing the learning curve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454128/#Comment_454128" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T20:47:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2016  8:47PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use page count as a synonym for complexity.

You'll probably find easier to learn how to play RPGs by playing it with a GM and players already knowledgeable of the game than reading it directly from the book. You can learn the tools of the trade more or less as quickly as in real life if you watch a couple of how-to videos. Next in efficiency are APs in comic format, specially if they represent both what's happening at the table and what's going on in the fiction. After that comes written AP examples, and then actual rules description.<br/><br/>Anima Beyond Fantasy would possibly need 1/5 more pages to be properly explained in text, and maybe a series of  15 minute videos to offer a proper walkthough, like 15 of them maybe to include proper character creation and GMastering. Maybe reducing the manual to the half and adding 32 pages of comic to explain the mechanics could do the deal. \n<blockquote><br/>Speaking of tastes and skillsets, for some reason much of this hobby seems to think we all  (at least should) share the same ones and gets defensive when we try to identify how we don't.

And of top it's easier to believe people who can't do what we do have an extremely rare flaw, instead of thinking we are the ones who have a somewhat rare gift.<br/><br/>It's somewhat sad that ultimately, all depends on marketing principles. The faster you can sell it, the more people you will reach, the more sales you get. Since RPGs are still somewhat hard to explain, it's most of the time not fast enough to keep possible buyers attention. Specially when the best part of the game only comes up after 5 minutes of play at the very best, using premade characters, a really streamlined system, and railroading a lot. It starts when players have answered the question "what do you do", roll a high number and the GM narrates what happens.<br/><br/><a href="http://corporatevisions.com/blog/2014/04/22/the-incredible-shrinking-attention-span-can-your-sales-story-survive/" rel="nofollow">But then all you've got to catch a potential buyer attention is possibly 8 seconds best.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454639/#Comment_454639" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T13:15:48+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  1:15PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm still thinking it's all due to the way indie games are explained and presented, like you've got to be <b>already familiar AND dissatisfied</b> with whatever is indie in your country, then actively search for whatever it isn't.</blockquote>\nSo there's an RPG called <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/186363/Unity-Free-Sampler" rel="nofollow">Unity</a> which is sold on the following features:<br/><br/>Class Fantasy<br/>Fail Forward<br/>Gridless combat<br/>2D10 Resolution<br/>Diceless GM-ing<br/><br/>But which of these are important let alone <i>meaningful</i> to those outside the hobby?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454640/#Comment_454640" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T14:55:40+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  2:55PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly! I'm not saying there isn't a place for books like these, and I'm certain that if the designers thought a bit more on the kind of experiende a new user would have, they could use the same mechanics and lore but present it in a bit of a different way so a person without experience in roleplaying would understand.<br/><br/>Checking their pitch, thinking as a newbie, I certainly don't get what is going on till the pharagraph about exploring a new interesting world, but then again I'm left wondering how is that supposed to go. The rest is completely cryptic as it tells me what the game doesn't need but can still include... I mean, even by the art and some detail in the text it could mislead me to believe it's a videogame.<br/><br/>Compare it to this, the first D&amp;D ad I saw in a comic book when I was a kid:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-slQr7fxvxOE/UVntB0k13AI/AAAAAAAAAhM/aAYHU5OdagE/s1600/dd6.jpg"/><br/><br/>Still cryptic as hell, it still doesn't say what it is and how it goes, and it's supposed to be the basic introductory set. Still a couple of phrases piqued my curiosity. The most I could think of it was that it was a sort of complicated tabletop game, as at some point later I was able to take a brief look at the contents of a module and (since I couldn't read in english at that time) all I saw was the dungeon maps on grids. The game had dice and as I was only familiar with "rolling the dice and moving your mini" mechanics I thought that was all dice were meant for, but the ad was promising more<br/><br/>I didn't got a clue about how tabletop rpgs went until I saw it being played, and even then it was cryptic as hell because I didn't knew what determined the pacing of the game and why combat was so detailed while travelling was hand-waved, nor why people were rolling the dice. Also, each time anyone asked a question, where did the answer came from? The GM had a couple of books and a screen, did it all came from there?<br/><br/>Even this older one tells you more about what is being sold:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Is7zbpFxQQk/UjpZ5_5byuI/AAAAAAAABrw/KFG86kKeLck/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-09-18+at+9.56.09+PM.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454712/#Comment_454712" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-06T06:20:03+00:00" title="July  6, 2016  6:20AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps being cryptic can actually <i>engage</i> potential players more than being clear.
