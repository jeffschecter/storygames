If you see someone's hand as turning, or your own, it could frame a new scene/conflict.<br/><br/>Here is a question I would like to see raised, without me providing an answer: When you "lost" an organ to the Angelic Host, do you maintain free will in regards to that organ, do you still control it? To what extent? Perhaps a conflict could be between you and the Mainframe regarding an action you/organ wants to take and the other does not, like saving a human sinner or striking them down (such as your wife, for loving you).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
