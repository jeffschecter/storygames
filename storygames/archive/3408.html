What are some things (3-10) that you'd love to see, or see more of, in a fantasy game? I'd even throw in setting-based rules into that mix as well.<br/><br/>Mine, in no particular order:<br/><br/>Airships and airship-related coolness (ideas for fighting, tactics, morale when they look like they are going to sink, a reason for them to exist, etc).<br/><br/>INDIA, and indian-themed cultural goodies.<br/><br/>Cool and interesting weapons, and real reasons to use them.<br/><br/>A magic system that's based on something: It doesn't have to all make total sense, but maybe it's based upon some simple rules or conventions that can limit it a little (rather than "all magic from fireballs to scrying to raising the dead can be done... because it's magic!")<br/><br/>Rules that let you draw upon your culture for boons.<br/><br/>More focus on clothing and food (particularly in a "non European" setting)<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76975/#Comment_76975" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T15:17:52+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  3:17PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different cultures other than the usual quasi-medieval tropes.<br/><br/>Either no races but human, or better developed races.<br/><br/>A distinction between race and culture when it comes to non-humans.<br/><br/>I'll second the airships!

Adventure is the stuff that happens while you're trying to do something else.<br/><br/>I want all magic items to have a history. If it was made by a human, it was made for a reason. If it is a gift of the gods, beware,  gods never really give gifts. If it is inherently magical (beholder eye or something), well, it has a history. These things shape empires and cause brother to turn against brother. Truly the most overlooked thing in all of RPGdom is the effect items can have on plot.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachlan</cite>Gaslight, hearth taxes, and a legal system based on Anglo-Saxon eorls.<br/><br/>Or a world that Doesn't Make Sense.

If your world is chock full o' mages that can transmute rock walls to mud, you don't spend your resources making castles. Suddenly, castles are stupid and everyone lives in nomadic tent communities. If there's only one dragon in the world, then the guy who kills it is pretty awesome and that wagon load of dragon hide he carts back might upset the balance of the entire kingdom.<br/><br/>Anglo-Saxon legal system idea is cool, or Scandinavian <em>Things</em>.<br/><br/>Airships? Cool. But only if its....<em>hydrogen</em> airships (and all that that implies).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77215/#Comment_77215" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T19:46:03+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  7:46PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a blast from the past. This is text from an old document of mine that inspired (at least in part) David Johansen's "among the beautiful creatures": <br/><br/>1. All (or nearly all) human PCs - think "Thieve's World" or "The Black Company". <br/><br/>2. An in-depth political overview (not just some quick, two-sentence blurbs on who controls what). A loose confederation of walled city-states seperated by hundreds of miles and who may not even be aware of one another's existence. <br/><br/>3. A fully detailed economy that doesn't have the campy "gold-piece standard", takes taxes into account, and takes a good look at supply and demand. <br/><br/>4. A fully detailed language system - nothing so generic as a universal "common". I'd like to see a dialect system implemented. Sign languages and the like would also be a nice touch. <br/><br/>5. A fully detailed guild/society section. Again, avoiding the ultra-generic standard of simply naming guilds and societies after the classes that they correspond with. Also, a break-down of how these guilds and socities interact might be a nice addition to the "politics" section. <br/><br/>6. Pantheons that play only minimal parts in the current world state, being looked upon as sad relics from less civilized times. Belief and worship in and of gods is a rare thing. <br/><br/>7. A largely (if not completely) ritual magic system would be a nice change of pace (and would fit the setting described thus far better than simple verbal or somatic casting). Perhaps an element of "belief magic" added to the ritual, meaning that if somebody believes enough in the power of a certain item, place, ideal, ect - that they can channel power through it.<br/><br/>8. A city-based or province based setting would be nice. There are not enough well-done localized campaign settings out there. <br/><br/>9. A planet that has stopped spinning on its axis, creating a "Nightside", "Sunside", and "Twilight" effect over the surface of the globe.<br/><br/>10. Monstrosities that lurk in the eternal darkness of the "Nightside" area, the target of regular incursions from "Twilight". <br/><br/>11. Ancient (and quite advanced) technology hidden in "Nightside", "Sunside", and remote "Twilight" ruins from aeons past.<br/><br/>12. Torchbearers as a guild specifically in charge of manning the night watch (excursions into the "Nightside"). Both warriors and scientists are important Torchbearer elements. <br/><br/>13. Clockwork technology, though nothing as fine as watches yet - many excavation machines, surveying equipment, and the occasional weapon. <br/><br/>13. The secret: The current state of the world is a direct result of the evil that they inherently do. That is, the collective dreams of the world's children have become manifest.Everything is symbolic. Specifically, the "Nightside" represents entropy and evil, the "Sunside" represents creation and divinity, and "Twilight" represents the place of man between the two. The rotation towards the "Nightside" represents mankind's slow but sure descent into evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77218/#Comment_77218" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T20:42:06+00:00" title="June 22, 2007  8:42PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I got more:<br/><br/>An otherworld, that's, well, otherworldly.<br/><br/>The law of Weregeld.<br/><br/>The Hanseatic league (or something like it). <br/><br/>Ruins of perfectly fitted massive stones from an ancient race of "Giants".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77226/#Comment_77226" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T00:15:14+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 12:15AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things that come to mind immediately:<br/><br/>I like when gods walk the earth, effing shit up, making titanic messes.  <br/><br/>I also like when you can walk to heaven or hell, when those places are just over the mountain range or in that there cave.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77231/#Comment_77231" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T00:57:36+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 12:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2007 12:57AM by shreyas.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Uh, I was gonna make a list, but basically: Earthsea, except with people that speak languages that <em>sound</em> Polynesian and South Asian.

Dragons would be slayed by armies not adventurers. Gave me interesting ideas about what a fantasy merchant guild might look like.<br/><br/>He also mentioned about how the economy in D&amp;D is aimed at game balance and if you try to use it to simulate a real world economy it will drive you mad.<br/><br/>As an aside, its a particularly insightful interview if you like RPG industry info.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
