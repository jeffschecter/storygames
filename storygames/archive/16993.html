In a design culture (where practice makes better), earning currency by employing skills reaps a double reward.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a barter system using virtual currency would reduce the hard margin. By hard margin, I mean cash margin (as opposed to man-hour margin). Paying an artist to do a cover for your Lady Blackbird hack is different to playtesting a few systems and using earned currency to commission the artwork.<br/><br/>This investigation comes off the back of conversation with a friend. He's an artist and I'm a graphic designer. He just blew a load of cash on a bad layout artist and didn't have the capital to invest in another try. I wanted to offer my help but my time is precious. If he could write me an IOU that I could spend later on his work, or on the work of another artist, that'd be just fine.<br/><br/>I've just signed up to <a href="https://villages.cc/" rel="nofollow">Villages</a> which uses the ripple system.

Also, the community has plentiful trust thanks to years of joint artistic endeavours, so there'll probably more currency in the system than we would ever need. The only major stumbling block that's been discouraging me here is the fact that gift economies, including the indie scene, are low in volatility, which means that most of the time a given person will have only little utility from messing with the system. Not much motivation in setting up a system that comes up once in a blue moon; for it to be truly useful for e.g. myself it'd need to be active and robust enough to facilitate game sales (my most common international economic transaction by far). As long as we're talking about helping out somebody every few months, it's easier to just do it instead of messing about with an accounting system.<br/><br/>This is to say, I'm all for a solution like Villages, it's an interesting experiment that won't hurt anybody even if it fizzles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386473/#Comment_386473" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T10:59:53+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 10:59AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2012 11:06AM by Sebastian.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/rafu">@rafu</a> Your scene-specific paradigm makes a hugely important distinction.

The thing this community excels at, for me, is the aggregation of ideas and experience, not the accumulation of luxury. Designers share. The distinction from the common marketplace, where services are often given reluctantly for the sake of living, is the hobbism, the passion for which has yet been unquantifiable.

The clever monkey could give other people flow instead of merely expressing delight.<br/><br/>Damn, I suppose I'll join it myself as well. Maybe start another thread Sebastian, to ask people explicitly and visibly to try this out?

I don't know how it goes with others, but for me I'm 99% of the time in helping mode and don't really need any help myself. On the other hand, when I do need help, I really <i>do</i> need help, so I guess that any system that would make that more likely would be worthwhile even if it doesn't do anything concrete in the short term.<br/><br/>And yes, I did indeed join Villages. (This is a landmark event for me, you understand - I join and use very few Internet services.) Now just start pestering me with requests, and I'll see about making the world a better place for practically no fee at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386488/#Comment_386488" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T14:22:01+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  2:22PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for joining Eero.
