I'll talk about it without any obvious spoilers.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Game 1</span>: Tanja, Lisa. Old friends.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Game 2</span>: Tanja, Daniel, Jen &amp; Joe (married), Melissa, Laura. Melissa is an old friend who had played an old playtest version (with other folks) over a year ago, about 3-4 sessions. Daniel is an experienced indie games player. Laura has some indie game experience with me. All are experienced D&amp;D players except Jen, who had never played an RPG before.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Game 3</span>: Tanja, Daniel, Steven. Steven is a hardcore D&amp;D guy, and he'd played in several of my 4e campaigns.<br/><br/>Everyone used a pre-gen except Daniel and Melissa. Daniel made up a character before he arrived, using the PDF that's available. He played different characters in the two games. Melissa had her old character from way back in the playtest days. She revised it when she got to the house to bring it up to speed with the PDF rules.<br/><br/><b>First impressions</b><br/><br/>Combat is fast! It moves about as fast as old Basic D&amp;D (I am most familiar with Moldvay). I used the fixed monster damage option to speed things up from the DM side. All I had to remember was that a goblin has AC 14 and does 5 damage (melee and ranged)--done! <br/><br/>Initiative is still a bit of a pain. I'm not really convinced of its value outside the tactical arena of 4e or even 3e. 5e combat is simple enough that there's seemingly not much value to tracking initiative order. Really, all you care about is who gets to attack before the monster on the first round, right? Then it's back and forth between monsters and PCs. Maybe with multiple monsters at different initiative times, that doesn't apply exactly, but I'd just use the boss for initiative and let everyone else attack at that time. Haven't tried it in actual play. I am pretty sure it'd make combat a lot faster. What happens now is that players sit there, waiting for the DM to say, "Okay, Laura, what do you do?" If they knew it was the "player turn" for combat, they'd all just coordinate their attacks and shout them out, and no one would have to maintain the order. I use index cards with names on them to manage order and that takes a minute or two to set up at the top of the combat, which is sorta excitement-destroying. It's easier for me to roll monster initiative once, say, "If you beat a 16, then you're first," let them go, handle monster attacks, then go into alternating PC-monster combat for the rest of the fight.<br/><br/>The rules for surprise were--well, pleasantly surprising. Basically, anyone who is surprised doesn't get actions on the first round of combat. There's no special surprise phase. This means that two PCs might be surprised but the rest won't be. Or two of the goblins are surprised but the rest are not. Easy to handle.<br/><br/>Advantage and disadvantage are brilliant and fun. If you have advantage, you roll an extra d20 and keep the best. If you have disadvantage, you roll an extra d20 and keep the worst. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other. Everyone loves rolling an extra d20! Disadvantage doesn't come up much, since players always seem to find ways to avoid it or cancel it out with Inspiration. Inspiration is the role-playing mechanic. Play to your specific personality traits (codified through Bonds and some other things), and the DM can award you Inspiration. I gave them a red gemstone to mark it. You only have one Inspiration point at any time. Spend it to earn advantage. I let players spend their Inspiration for advantage /after/ they rolled the first d20 (and failed). Probably not what the rule intends, but it makes them use Inspiration more often, which gets them to role-play to /earn/ Inspiration more often. I'd rather they were role-playing more than playing the tactical game of "should I use Inspiration on this roll?"<br/><br/>(more in a bit)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435872/#Comment_435872" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T08:50:54+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  8:50AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, the way that Inspiration works is really, really nifty.

(But then again, I liked 3rd Edition when it was just the PHB too).<br/><br/>It reminds me of Sword and Sorcery's White Box; old school feel but with more streamlined sensical rules, and some nice nods to narrative gaming (the inspiration rules, for example).<br/><br/>I LOVE the class + background combos.

They have different mechanics, more akin to 2e than 3e or 4e. However, they've borrowed ideas from 3rd and 4th. For example, where every character in 4th could use Second Wind to recover some hit points during combat, now only the Fighter can do it. At 2nd level, the rogue gets access to an ability that lets them hide as a free action. Our halfling rogue used it to great effect: she'd move ten feet or so to her opponent, attack, move ten feet away back into the woods (you're allowed to split your movement that way), then hide as a free action. Her enemies couldn't touch her, as long as she rolled a strong Dexterity (Stealth) check. <br/><br/>Spell slots are handled differently than before. You have access to a certain number of spells. You prepare (memorize) some of them. Then you get a certain number of slots to cast spells. For example, a 1st level cleric with Wisdom 14 (+2) knows 3 cantrips and all the 1st level cleric spells. Cantrips don't require memorization. The cleric prepares (cleric level + Wisdom modifier) spells, so 1+2=3 spells, say Detect Magic, Healing Word, and Sanctuary. The cleric can cast 2 of those at 1st level. She could cast Cure Wounds twice, or Healing Word twice, or whatever. The cleric also gets some domain spells, which are considered "always prepared" for free. A cleric in the Life domain gets Bless and Cure Wounds as prepared spells for free, so that'd be three prepared spells a day. <br/><br/>Wizards are similar. At 1st level, a wizard has 6 spells in her spellbook, prepares (wizard level + Intelligence modifier) spells every day, and casts two 1st level spells per day. Note that for wizards and clerics, there is no restriction about which levels of spells you prepare. A 3rd level wizard with Intelligence 16(+3) can cast four 1st level spells and two 2nd level spells, but prepares 2+3=5 spells of 1st or 2nd level. <br/><br/>Spells that have the "ritual" tag can be cast without being prepared, but it takes 10 minutes longer. This means you don't have to prepare Detect Magic as an "adventurer tax." As long as you have access to that spell, you can cast it as a ritual, but it will take at least ten minutes. Probably not a problem, and something you can do while the fighter meatshield takes a short rest to get some hit points back.<br/><br/>Characters are pretty durable. Characters get hit dice (cleric d8, fighter d10, rogue d8, wizard d6) and roll these per level for hit points. At 0 hit points or below, characters fall unconscious. Damage that would reduce hit points to less than 0 is cut off, so hit points stick at 0, not -5 or whatever. However, if you have N hp and damage would reduce you to -N hp, you die. At 0 hp, you start making death saves--basically a 50/50 roll that earns you a success or failure (3 successes brings you back to 1 hp, 3 failures kills you). Another PC can stabilize an unconscious character with a Medicine skill check (DC 10); stabilized means no more death saves, but you're still at 0 hp. Natural healing is very limited (only heal 1 hp after 1-4 hours, no more after that). You can, though, always spend your hit dice, roll them, and regain that many hit points. Spent hit dice return after a long rest (8 hours/day). In play at my table, PCs dropped to 0 hp regularly, but the cleric revived them quickly (and no one died). <br/><br/>(ETA: Also, max hit points at first level.)<br/><br/>The skill system is uninspiring. It's the usual skills with a few changes. Spot is replaced with Perception. Bluff is replaced with Deception. Diplomacy is replaced with Persuasion. There are separate skills for Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, all of which describe your ability to recall lore about the subject. Investigation is a new Int-based skill that replaces Search--well, sorta. Investigation is basically the "solve deductive reasoning problems with my character's smarts" skill. You have access to all skills as unmodified ability checks. You have proficiency in a handful of these, and that adds your proficiency bonus to them (+2 at 1st level). You can still play a cleric that isn't specially trained in Religion, and there's no context to these skills (knowing Religion means you know about all religions, not just yours). 13th Age's backgrounds, despite their problems, at least nicely handle the context part. Inspiration applies to skill checks, too, so you can gain advantage on a skill roll. There's no sign of a "skill challenge" system. There are rules for working together (one person rolls, with advantage) and rolls for group checks (everyone rolls, but at least half must succeed). <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435884/#Comment_435884" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T12:35:44+00:00" title="July 28, 2014 12:35PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Was anyone dissapointed of their character's class mechanics?

I heard a few exclamations of, "oh, this is cooler than I thought it was." The fighter was a great meat shield because of his Second Wind. The halfling rogue loved leaping out and attacking with extra backstab damage then hiding (though getting extra damage but not an attack bonus for backstab felt strange to them, but they figured out how to get advantage anyway). The wizard liked how the sleep spell worked (5d8-ish hit points of creatures fall asleep, based on <i>current</i> hit points, starting with the lowest current hp value). The dwarven cleric did healing things but also got to smash people in the face with a warhammer and turned two skeletons.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435886/#Comment_435886" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T12:48:24+00:00" title="July 28, 2014 12:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the fact that they finally renamed Diplomacy to what its actual function is.

The DM describes the environment.<br/>2. The players describe what they want to do.<br/>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions. Return to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Fine, right?<br/><br/>Except those six paragraphs don't mention dice, except once: "In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action." If you were learning this game from scratch, you'd probably assume the DM rolled all the dice for the players.<br/><br/>You'd probably also assume that players never got to describe the effects of their actions themselves. <br/><br/>I remember playing in some DM's 4e game, and I'd say what I wanted to do, and he'd describe exactly what my character did as a result of my actions. I hated it. I sat quietly and dealt with it, but was fuming inside. I wanted to describe in glorious detail how my spell worked. Worse, sometimes the DM would step into territory I considered to be role-playing my character. How my wizard reacted to falling, for example. Not cool.<br/><br/>But this procedure basically makes that the way you play.<br/><br/><br/>I think the <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/206" rel="nofollow">IIEE stuff</a> is fuzzy here, too. It <i>looks</i> like the DM gets to block at effect, maybe sometimes at execution, but never at intent or initiation. If you try to throw the goblin off the building, the DM probably tells you to roll to hit, and if the roll succeeds, describes the goblin falling off, and someone rolls falling damage and the DM applies it to the goblin. It's possible that the DM could interpret your to-hit roll as a failure of execution, though: "You can't even grab the squirmy little guy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435891/#Comment_435891" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T13:57:04+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  1:57PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other annoying bits in the text:<br/><br/>"The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group<br/>of characters embarking on an adventure that the<br/>Dungeon Master presents to them."<br/><br/>plus<br/><br/>"The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with<br/>a beginning, a middle, and an end.

In fact, it basically says that's not important by suggesting some unusual choices. What's important is that you are excited to play a certain role. <br/><br/>In general, I think the rest of the rules--especially backgrounds and such--support a RTD agenda pretty well.

(Hey, by the way, I think this is the first edition in a long time that hasn't changed the order of the abilities!) I called for a Charisma save in one of the games I ran this weekend, when the rogue shouted, "We killed Klaarg! We will kill all of you now!" and made an Intimidation check. In this case, the goblins all had to make a Charisma saving throw against the rogue's modified Intimidation roll. <br/><br/>I have no idea when I'd ask a player to make an Intelligence save and how this is different than a standard Intelligence check. Each class gains proficiency in two different saving throws (and thus applies the +2 proficiency bonus to those saves at 1st level), so there's one difference, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435897/#Comment_435897" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T14:27:52+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  2:27PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, 4e's distinction of at-will, encounter, and daily powers still exists, but those names are not used.

That makes them better meat shields. They also get a fighting style which reminds me a ton of the old fighter options in 1e's Unearthed Arcana (choose: +2 ranged, +1 AC, +2 damage with single-weapon style, reroll low damage for two-handed weapons, use a shield to disadvantage an attack vs. an adjacent ally, add damage to two-weapon attacks). <br/><br/>Also, 2nd level fighters get an Action Surge, which is basically an extra action/attack. It's an encounter power (requires short rest to use again). At 5th level, they get Extra Attack, which makes every attack two attack rolls. That increases to three attacks at 11th and four at 20th. Yowza! On an action surge round once per encounter, that's eight attack rolls!<br/><br/>It looks like they did away with Prestige Classes and replaced them with Archetypes. For example, a fighter can choose the Champion archetype at 3rd level, and gain Improved Critical immediately and four other powers through 18th level. It's hard to know for sure, but it appears that each archetype is like a specific subclass--really, as I think Rob Donoghue pointed out--more like a Kit from the old 2e Player's Options books. I can't imagine why a player would fail to choose an archetype, since it adds significant abilities. It's not an optional thing, but I guess a DM could ban them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435900/#Comment_435900" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T14:54:15+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  2:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I alluded earlier, the rogue's sneak attack is tricky. Here's how it works.<br/><br/>Sneak Attack grants +1d6 damage with a finesse weapon or ranged weapon. It does not grant an attack bonus or advantage on the attack. In fact, you must have advantage on the attack to apply the extra damage. The exception to this rule is what makes it work like 4e's flanking sneak attack: You don't need advantage when there's an ally* adjacent to the target (but if you have disadvantage to the attack or the target is incapacitated already, forget it). <br/><br/>Basically, as long as you have an ally nearby the enemy, you get your sneak attack extra damage on the attack.<br/><br/>At 2nd level, the rogue gets Cunning Action, which lets them take one free Dash, Disengage, or Hide action per combat turn. Disengage basically is the "5-foot step" rule that gets you out of Opportunity Attacks. Dash is a double move. Hide is the Stealth check that I talked about earlier. It wouldn't work for a melee fight, but in the bow vs. crossbow "gun battle" I described earlier, it was perfect. She moved out of the woods, shot her bow, then used her free action to Hide back in the trees where she couldn't be seen. The brigands that were trying to shoot her had to make Perception checks to beat her Stealth roll, or they didn't know where to shoot. <br/><br/><b>Epic Spit Take</b><br/><br/>Incidentally, those rules produced the most epic spit-take I have ever encountered. After the second or third time that the halfling managed to pop out and nail the brigands with her bow, then hide where they couldn't spot her, I-as-DM-playing-the-brigand yelled, "Fucking halflings!" For some reason, this caught Lisa totally off guard and tickled her funny bone in a big way. She'd just taken a big gulp of Coke, which she summarily sprayed over a range I'd liken to that of the Burning Hands spell, catching me and Tanja in her Area of Effect. It didn't end there, though. Our stunned reaction and laughter made her unable to bring her mouthful of soda under control, and she sprayed us not once more, but TWICE more. It was EPIC. And hilarious.<br/><br/>* The rules specifically say "another enemy of the target," which isn't quite the same as "an ally," I realize.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435903/#Comment_435903" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T15:43:37+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  3:43PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 3:50PM by Rickard.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun to hear that combat is fast.\n<blockquote>Initiative is still a bit of a pain. /.../ What happens now is that players sit there, waiting for the DM to say, "Okay, Laura, what do you do?"

I suspect this kind of "what is role-playing" crap gets written at the last minute as filler and people just fall back on what they think they're supposed to say rather than what they really mean. It's a pet peeve of mine, which is why I'm whining about it here.<br/><br/>I realize it's not a big deal. People are going to figure out how to play D&amp;D without this stuff being written better. It's just, the rules here aren't really gonna help them.</blockquote>\nNot only do I see no issues with what they say, it's how nearly every gaming session I've ever seen has been done (including my own). In other words, that IS how vast quantities of people do play D&amp;D, or anything else.<br/><br/>I think they would be better served by mentioning that this is only one way to go about it, and providing alternative text for these other styles, but as you said its a minor point as people will adapt things to fit them over time anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435935/#Comment_435935" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T19:54:29+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  7:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get a little worried when I see dramatic increase in hit points, even while the `Bounded Accuracy` and lack of `super-builds` keeps the range of ability within a reasonable realm.<br/><br/>Is there any danger of weirdnesss from this?

The DM describes the environment.<br/>2. The players describe what they want to do.<br/>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions. Return to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Fine, right?<br/><br/>Except those six paragraphs don't mention dice, except once: "In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action." If you were learning this game from scratch, you'd probably assume the DM rolled all the dice for the players.</blockquote>\nFollowing this section are Game Dice, D20, Advantange/Disadvantage, and General beats Specific. These sections particularly the d20 section, detail how and you roll dice to determine the results of an action.\n<blockquote>You'd probably also assume that players never got to describe the effects of their actions themselves. <br/><br/>I remember playing in some DM's 4e game, and I'd say what I wanted to do, and he'd describe exactly what my character did as a result of my actions. I hated it. I sat quietly and dealt with it, but was fuming inside. I wanted to describe in glorious detail how my spell worked. Worse, sometimes the DM would step into territory I considered to be role-playing my character. How my wizard reacted to falling, for example. Not cool.</blockquote>\nDescribing the effects of their actions <b>within the world</b> is what the dungeon master is supposed to do. In real life if you touched a stove you get burned. Physics ensure that. You talk rudely to a waitress, she may choose to give you poor service. That her choice. In both cases the Dungeons &amp; Dragons equivalent handled by the Dungeon Masters acting as a referee. However the 4e referee was not doing his job especially when dictated how your character acted for example how you reacted after a long fall. However how the spell worked is part of the "physics" although as a skilled wizard controlling arcane forces it is logical that you have some control over the precise effect of your spell. If it was just color I would not have of problem with a player narrating how it worked. If it did have a mechanical effect, say a specific hit location, I may have the caster attempt a check (skill, ability, etc) to see if his skill can pull it off. If it a extensive alteration of how the spell works I will disallowed it because it just not how the spell works in the setting.<br/>\n<blockquote>But this procedure basically makes that the way you play.<br/><br/>I think the <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/206" rel="nofollow">IIEE stuff</a> is fuzzy here, too. It <i>looks</i> like the DM gets to block at effect, maybe sometimes at execution, but never at intent or initiation. If you try to throw the goblin off the building, the DM probably tells you to roll to hit, and if the roll succeeds, describes the goblin falling off, and someone rolls falling damage and the DM applies it to the goblin. It's possible that the DM could interpret your to-hit roll as a failure of execution, though: "You can't even grab the squirmy little guy."</blockquote>\nThe point is that the setting exist independently of the referee and players. It is defined before the campaign and in the absence of specifics things are assumed to work as they do in real-life. A dropped clay mug will likely shatter on the floor and so on. A fair referee would not make stuff up out of whole cloth but rather acts a adjudicator of what already there. Again assuming in the absence of specific that things work or are as they are in real life. The fairest thing to do in the absence of something written down is to roll on a table of likely results. Want to know what plants are in the area, roll on a table. <br/><br/>The referee's creativity comes from deciding which of the possible outcomes of a player's actions is the most interesting and fun for the campaign. <br/><br/>If written detail, random tables, and similar tools are not being used by the referee then there is a good chance that is rulings are arbitrary and unfair.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435959/#Comment_435959" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T07:10:07+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  7:10AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, the advice is bad. :-( I disagree with you about the math behind Prof Bonus, though, Adam.

My issue is that it states that an adventure is a story (so far, so good) that has a beginning, middle, and end (so far, so good), and that the DM provides it all (ack). The DM can provide the beginning and, in my opinion, should mostly leave the middle and end to the actions of the players. To do otherwise makes it less of a game and more like just being told a story. Some people might play that way, sure, but from my convention experience, I don't get the feeling that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> people play that way.

It looks like they want the DM to roll all the dice. Do they? The rules never say who rolls the dice, but "How to Play" (section 2, para 2.) strongly implies that the DM does the rolling ("In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action").

The players describe what they <b>want</b> to do," emphasis added), not even Initiation, which would be "the players describe what their characters do." <br/><br/>The play procedure in that section is pretty clear how you're supposed to play:<br/><br/>1.

I do see your point. The How to Play is a summary, the details of what you are talking about are found in Chapter 8 Adventuring. Specifically page 66 under Social Interactions and Roleplaying. For the referee what he should be doing is following section "Results of Roleplaying." Something that 4e referee you ran into needs to read.\n<blockquote>If you look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Play</span> section in IIEE terms, the players get to describe Intent ("2.

However, the tone, amount, and examples are such it would be a stretch to conclude that how it played. The PDF is free and folks can judge for themselves.<br/><br/>I will add that one of the problems of 4e was the mocking tone it took to prior editions and the way you should play. Throughout the development of 5e Mearls has avoided advising THE way of playing. There is a recommended method when you read through it but it largely avoids saying anything is the wrong way. In fact points out alternatives in some places.

We tend to prefer 30-36 levels to cap, and starting lower power for several levels. We also prefer really immersing into one game for an extended time, and only switch between games when necessary or after having our fill.<br/><br/>Heck, in high school we started a weekly game one April that grew to be three days a week in June-August, with each session going 8-12 hours.

My issue is that it states that an adventure is a story (so far, so good) that has a beginning, middle, and end (so far, so good), and that the DM provides it all (ack). The DM can provide the beginning and, in my opinion, should mostly leave the middle and end to the actions of the players. To do otherwise makes it less of a game and more like just being told a story. Some people might play that way, sure, but from my convention experience, I don't get the feeling that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> people play that way. Some? sure.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI have no idea how Mearls plays, but I can tell you that's how most of the old guard played, at least for the first twenty or so years. I've read the interviews, listened to the podcasts, etc. Heck, even more modern games simply go that way by default for most people (watch the AI broadcasts from PAX for instance). It's also how nearly every group I've ever seen for thirty years played. Not that personal experiences indicates objective reality, but given the vast number neither is it totally dismissible.<br/><br/>No, I'm saying I DM the game, and the players are players...or one of them DMs the game while I play, or whatever combo we're doing right then. As DM I (or they) craft the environment, plots, storylines, etc (though as I mentioned in the other thread I get player input to do so). The players play while the story is going on around/behind them, taking it in some unforeseen directions quite often, while they evolve the stories of their own characters within this world. However the role of the DM is to fit those new directions and personal stories into the overall story being told which was already designed before they ever came to the table. In that respect he has still crafted the middle and end. It's just that the things that happen along the way are dynamic and chance may intervene to change things (kill characters, alter situations, etc). <br/><br/>In most cases in the history of pen and paper RPGs (again, at least up til say 2000 or so) the stories came from purchased modules or the DM as mentioned above. There's no ack there, it's basic fact supportable from a vast number of sources (books, interviews, podcasts, personal accounts, etc).<br/><br/>Now, some people don't prefer that style, and looked for alternatives. Fortunately there are games that cater specifically to them, or they've found ways to adapt other games to their needs, as the hobby has grown to encompass these additional styles. I LOVE that this happens. It doesn't change the fact that the bulk of RPGs were designed around the storyteller/participants dichotomy, nor that it continues to be a VERY common and equally valid playstyle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435979/#Comment_435979" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T12:30:31+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 12:30PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd argue that the trend to railroaded storytelling in D&amp;D was a movement that started when TSR started writing stories into modules. It wasn't a universal constant in gaming back in the early 80's (I can't talk about much personal experience from the 70's). If OSR stuff is any indication of truth, then sandboxing is more common than railroading story, too. I just don't think that style of play is as common as you think it is.<br/><br/>Maybe it's half of the games I've experienced under other DMs at conventions or game stores or other people's tables. Maybe half. Probably more like 20-25%. The vast majority was more like a sandbox: here's what I prepped, make of it what you will. No pre-planned outcome. <br/><br/>Anyway, it's interesting if 5e is actually encouraging that one particular style of play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435982/#Comment_435982" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T13:09:52+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  1:09PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So much of the answer to that question\u2014the "real" playstyle of 5E\u2014will depend on both what is in the DMG and how well spelled-out it is.

That's why I said it should be one of many options offered.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a preplanned outcome...having a storyline (or module) isn't the same as knowing the outcome. Having an adventure planned isn't necessarily railroading (at least not entirely). What's more, if the party WANTS to do what you have planned, well then frankly that's not really railroading either, even if they stick to it exactly. I have a feeling that when most people say 'railroading' they're talking about extreme worst-cast scenarios where I'd agree it wasn't my cup of tea. But there's a middle ground.<br/><br/>For instance, if I write a dungeon delve culminating in a showdown with an evil wizard to take his magic toad to cure a sick child there's nothing that says the party will actually do that. If they get the frog the kid certainly lives, but maybe clever adventurers steal it and so skip the showdown part. That's great for me, because now there's an evil wizard with a grudge hunting the party in later adventures, and if things get too easy he can turn up at the worst possible instant heightening the intensity and (if they overcome it) the fun. Of course, my groups know I'll do this, so most likely even if they steal the toad they'll just send it back with the sick and injured and the rest of the party will plot a dastardly ambush/assassination of the wizard on their own terms to give them the advantage. So in the end they kill the wizard and get the toad, but I had no way to know it'd go down like that.<br/><br/>For us it's that back and forth that's half the fun of roleplaying. Sometimes my plots (or random chance) beat the group, and sometimes they best me. Most often its somewhere in the middle...a 'win' with consequences. All are equally fun outcomes for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435986/#Comment_435986" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T13:59:03+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  1:59PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If that's how you're defining pre-planned story and railroading, then we've been in agreement all along! It sounds like you're not scripting outcomes or even using hidden DM force to make planned outcomes happen most of the time, right?<br/><br/>That's not what the 5e rules are saying though. They're telling the DM to create a story/adventure with a beginning, middle, and end, which could teach some DMs to totally script the whole thing and force players into an outcome.

Phoenix took it to mean a return to a classic style of play. That probably how Mearls and crew intended D&amp;D to be interpreted. That it is flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of play styles. One method the rules accomplish this is a straightforward and minimal core. Another is the tone of the writing.

The starter kit has a handful of monsters that are used by the Phandelver module. Those monster write-ups include XP reward totals and some kind of encounter score, presumably for encounter balancing.<br/><br/>The module uses two kinds of rewards. For the first two sections, it used milestones. The first milestone was basically one little encounter and it was worth 75 XP to all participants. The second milestone was clearing out a small lair and defeating a boss. It was worth 225 XP each. PCs need 300 XP to advance to level 2, so it was designed specifically to get players to 2nd level by the end of the lair, in one solid session of play.

I read Mearls' article when it came out two-three years ago. However, I am not reading the same things you and Phoenix are reading in the rules. What I'm reading does leave some things open-ended, but I feel like it's pretty strongly suggesting one type of play. Where you see a lack of direction as license to do what you want, I'm seeing specific language suggesting that people play a certain way.<br/><br/>Where you see "Encouraging options at every turn," I don't see that as incompatible with what I'm saying. I feel like players can have lots of options at every turn, yet the DM could be plotting the outcomes of His Story in classic illusionist style. It's just that the DM will secretly make those player options not change His Story. Where you see "not taking a strong tone on how the game ought to be played," I see a three-point procedure that tells the DM, straight-up, to narrate everything that happens, with nary a word about not stepping into the territory that is traditionally the players'.<br/><br/>You guys don't see what I see, so we're going to have to agree to disagree, I guess. <br/><br/>For the millionth time--because this will get forgotten if I don't repeat it--I am sure that the game will be fine, and that players will figure out how to play it (probably from oral tradition and seeing others play, but maybe just from working it out at their own tables). <br/><br/>I wonder, if I were to try to write a set of D&amp;D game procedures that left <i>all</i> of these style decisions to each gaming group, how would I do it?<br/><br/>Maybe D&amp;D Next is the Rorschach test of gaming. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436019/#Comment_436019" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T07:12:04+00:00" title="July 30, 2014  7:12AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rorschach test, eh?

To much treasure, not enough treasure, you need to be more active in roleplaying, do many dungeons, not enough dungeons, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>The Basic D&amp;D PDF largely avoids that sort of thing. What I should have said is that they don't discourage any option. Allowing people to read into the rule it is OK to plot the outcome of the story in illusionist style. <br/><br/>My opinion is that illusionism is NOT something that would make for a successful campaign. But also these days, I would also say, "Well if you make it work and everybody has fun more power to you."  And that the attitude written into the Basic PDF. Mostly because they don't discourage anything. \n<blockquote>Maybe D&amp;D Next is the Rorschach test of gaming. <br/></blockquote>\nI think that about simple of a summary that could be made on the topic.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436107/#Comment_436107" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T09:13:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  9:13AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'll be interesting to see what they do in the actual books.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, what's up with spot checks?

You get in fights so you can use all your nifty special abilities, and if you use them wisely that ups your odds of winning without major costs, etc.  As you advance, you get new things you can do, adding new options to the menu.  Sure, there's plenty of play outside combat, but combat strategy is kind of where it's at, right?<br/><br/><i>If</i> that is true, then the Inspiration mechanic seems unwelcome and beside the point to me.  Here we've got this formal system to master, and then poof, we get a drastic boost to our odds just for entertaining the GM.  What?  Now the wisdom of my powers-use is an even smaller percentage of the equation than it already was.<br/><br/>What do you think?

And you can use Inspiration on any d20 roll, so that includes skill checks or whatever. (Again, compare it to a Fate or Persona point in BW: not likely to swing a fight, but pretty likely to help on a non-combat check.)<br/><br/>There's no "social combat" system, AFAICT, but that's almost certainly a good thing. There's just enough stuff going on to make interacting with NPCs worthwhile, without turning 5E into a courtly intrigue game \xe0 la BW.<br/><br/>And there are exploration-focused Feats and powers, too; see the preview on Facebook of Dungeon Delver for a nice example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436158/#Comment_436158" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T09:28:28+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  9:28AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Adam, I'm curious about one thing, can you check me on this?<br/><br/>It sounds from the class powers that this is classic combat strategy roleplay.  You get in fights so you can use all your nifty special abilities, and if you use them wisely that ups your odds of winning without major costs, etc.  As you advance, you get new things you can do, adding new options to the menu.  Sure, there's plenty of play outside combat, but combat strategy is kind of where it's at, right?<br/><br/><i>If</i> that is true, then the Inspiration mechanic seems unwelcome and beside the point to me.  Here we've got this formal system to master, and then poof, we get a drastic boost to our odds just for entertaining the GM.  What?  Now the wisdom of my powers-use is an even smaller percentage of the equation than it already was.<br/><br/>What do you think?  Do these aspects of the game work together, or is there tension between them?</blockquote>\nD&amp;D as presented in 5e is a game about getting in fights with monsters, taking their stuff, and leveling up so you can take on bigger monsters--no doubt about it. And they did a great job of making that part of the game super fast and fun.<br/><br/>But a lot of people felt that 4e's mechanics were so uniform across classes that they all started to feel exactly the same. I admit my eyes glazed over whenever I paged through a character class's twisty maze of powers, all alike. 5e's expression of class rules differentiates classes a good deal and gets rid of the chapters of class powers that made me yawn.<br/><br/>Does Inspiration throw a monkey wrench into the combat gearworks? Only if you think that combat is all about <i>fiore</i> and player challenge and not about role-playing. <br/><br/>I'd argue that a lot of players love the minigame of combat, but that it is more about seeing their guy be awesome in the fantasy world--i.e., wish fulfillment--rather than beating the GM at a chess game. In that context, Inspiration is perfect. In combat, you get to be more awesome because, outside of combat, you role-played how awesome you are. At the table, it works marvelously. The Inspiration advantage bonus is sufficiently alluring to make players strive to have that Inspiration gem in front of them rather than in the bowl in the middle of the table (I used red gems to represent that they had it or didn't have it). They don't have to use it in combat, but they probably will. Outside of combat, the need to earn that Inspiration gem encourages them to scan their character sheet for any way to showcase one of their BIFTs (beliefs, ideals, flaws, traits). <br/><br/>It's a strong reward cycle. The elements work together, not at cross purposes. <br/><br/>Even if you're a challenge-focused gamer, then between combat challenges, you will be encouraged to role-play to earn Inspiration. I don't see that at cross-purposes with even the most hardcore Gamist table's agenda, really. Role-playing doesn't get in the way of Gamist play! In fact, role-playing opportunities must be considered as part of the strategy of a Gamist table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436168/#Comment_436168" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T12:02:00+00:00" title="August  1, 2014 12:02PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2014 12:04PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, in the How to Play section of the new Basic Rules, it basically says play goes like this:<br/><br/>1. The DM describes the environment.<br/>2. The players describe what they want to do.<br/>3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions. Return to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/></blockquote>\nAt least they HAVE a protocol for play explicitly stated, clearly and succintly early in the book, which I was very happy to see.\n<blockquote>I remember playing in some DM's 4e game, and I'd say what I wanted to do, and he'd describe exactly what my character did as a result of my actions. I hated it.     I sat quietly and dealt with it, but was fuming inside. I wanted to describe in glorious detail how my spell worked. Worse, sometimes the DM would step into territory I considered to be role-playing my character. How my wizard reacted to falling, for example. Not cool.</blockquote>\nI thought about that too, when reading 5e, since I\u2019ve also been in games like that (though CoC and B/X, I haven\u2019t experienced it in 4e).<br/>Luckily I spoke up to the DMs about it and it was quickly changed in both cases!<br/><br/>And it\u2019s a very \u201czorkian\u201d way of play. It\u2019s not all bad. But, I agree with you, it\u2019s not my preference.\n<blockquote>But this procedure basically makes that the way you play.</blockquote>\nThat\u2019s one interpretation, since because execution and effect are muddled in the protocol here.<br/>It\u2019s not necessarily so though. It could be that just what <em>happens</em> is narrated.<br/>For example, in that B/X game, when I hit something with my axe, I quickly put a kibosh to the DM describing my hacking and how my character took some sort of glee in the hacking. Instead I could describe it as the somber and reluctant fighter I wanted to play. Still, the DM could describe where the axe landed and what happened to the skeleton, etc, and I was fine with that.<br/>With the CoC GM we called it \u201cdescing\u201d, our cute nickname for \u201cdescribing what happens\u201d and we had a discussion about it that left all parties happy.<br/>We\u2019ll see.\n<blockquote>It's possible that the DM could interpret your to-hit roll as a failure of execution, though: "You can't even grab the squirmy little guy."</blockquote>\nThat\u2019s fine.<br/>\n<blockquote>"The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with<br/>a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might<br/>be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off<br/>the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM\u2019s needs<br/>and desires."</blockquote>\nThis, on the other hand, is not fine. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.<br/>The Lost Mine of Phandelver is great but the \u201cadventure creation advice\u201d needs to be much better.<br/>This is what makes Moldvay\u2019s and Mentzer\u2019s sets so good. They are all about \u201cThis is how you create and stock a world\u201d \u2014 i.e. setting up a situation.\n<blockquote>I think it's just sloppy writing. I suspect this kind of "what is role-playing" crap gets written at the last minute as filler and people just fall back on what they think they're supposed to say rather than what they really mean. It's a pet peeve of mine, which is why I'm whining about it here.</blockquote>\nMe too. I think this is important.<br/>I\u2019m excited about 5e and we\u2019ve played a short session that went great. But. I didn\u2019t come new to it and I wasn\u2019t \u201cformed\u201d by this paragraph, since I came fresh from B/X.<br/>Before I discovered the OSR, however... ugh... RPGs were basically unplayable to me and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried. Great summary, that Impossible Thing Before Breakfast. Describes the problem during the \u201cdark age of RPG\u201d exactly.\n<blockquote>I realize it's not a big deal. People are going to figure out how to play D&amp;D without this stuff being written better. It's just, the rules here aren't really gonna help them.</blockquote>\nIt might hinder them.<br/>\n<blockquote>So there's this thing called Proficiency Bonus. It goes up at a slow rate relative to level (+2 at 1st, +3 at 5th, +4 at 9th, +5 at 13th, +6 at 17th), laid out in the Character Advancement chart. It seems to me to be inelegant.</blockquote>\nI love it for two reasons.<br/>1. Realize that this replaces a bunch of different BAB charts and skill points and other miscy and confusing and tedious things.<br/>2. The slow rate is great because it keeps the to-hit range narrow == game makes sense across all the levels.<br/>In 5e higher levels = more HP instead of more AC/BAB. Much better.\n<blockquote>13th Age  [...] add +5 to middle-tier challenges and +10 to upper-tier challenges.</blockquote>\nI hate that. One of the true warts on the otherwise elegant 13th Age.<br/>At least it does it explicitly and consistently. This was one of the things I grappled with in Fate Core, also.<br/>I\u2019ve decided that I want static DCs.

It seems to me to be inelegant.</blockquote>\nI love it for two reasons.<br/>1. Realize that this replaces a bunch of different BAB charts and skill points and other miscy and confusing and tedious things.<br/>2. The slow rate is great because it keeps the to-hit range narrow == game makes sense across all the levels.<br/>In 5e higher levels = more HP instead of more AC/BAB. Much better.<br/></blockquote>\nNo, that's not what I mean. As presented, the Proficiency Bonus is a nice, elegant way to handle all those different things that other editions did with BAB charts and skill points and such. Fine.<br/><br/>However, 13th Age has an /even more elegant/ solution, which is that every character just adds +level to every skill check. To compensate, they add +5 to DCs for each increase in adventuring tier (+10 for Epic encounters, for example). So a 2nd level Fighter making a stealth skill check rolls Dex bonus + background bonus + 2. That same Fighter at 8th level rolls Dex bonus + background bonus + 8. The DC at 2nd level is probably 15 for a moderate task in the Adventurer tier. In the Epic tier where that 8th level Fighter is probably exploring, that same stealth check probably has a DC of 25.<br/><br/>I guess, now that I try to explain it, it feels less elegant. <blockquote>13th Age  [...] add +5 to middle-tier challenges and +10 to upper-tier challenges.</blockquote>\nI hate that. One of the true warts on the otherwise elegant 13th Age.<br/>At least it does it explicitly and consistently. This was one of the things I grappled with in Fate Core, also.<br/>I\u2019ve decided that I want static DCs. Again in keeping with the idea of setting up a world and letting the players loose in that world.<br/><br/>I love it. It matters that the DC applies to the /environment/ and not the PC level. That is, a 1st level Fighter who drifts into an Epic-tier environment is going to be making DC 25 skill checks probably!

That was the point I was trying to make \u2014 it\u2019s not an acting competition, it\u2019s keyed into using the TIBFs.<br/>Just like if a proficiency applies to an ability check you get the proficiency bonus, if your TIBFs are the reason for a \u201csuboptimal choice\u201d, you get insp. No \u201cgood\u201d role-playing needed beyond just acknowledning and applying your TIBFs \u2014 which in and of themselves are roleplaying tools.\n<blockquote>Technically, I think the rules ask players to apply Inspiration before the roll.

If your target is unconscious you have Advantage and therefore do the SA, no problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436274/#Comment_436274" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T20:55:49+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  8:55PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2014 8:56PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, wait, can I only earn Insp <i>outside</i> of combat?

I.e. if they\u2019re fighting two gostaks, a dosh and a distimmer, the DM will make three rolls and put them all in the initiative order. Good tools are needed for this... it\u2019s clunky and I\u2019m embarrased everytime I ask \u201cOK, now it\u2019s time to roll for initiative\u201d and everyone is like \u201cUGH BORING!\u201d because it\u2019s the boringest part of the fight, to them. But I think it\u2019s a matter of [character] life and death \u2014 getting the first hit in is a big deal.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve also forgotten about opportunity attacks a couple of times that really would matter. It\u2019s been an awesome and simple rule when I have remembered it \u2014 adds a lot of strategy to TotM fighting \u2014 but I\u2019ve forgotten it and my forgetting it has saved the party\u2019s lives. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> [Because one was unconscious and the other two had one hit point left and they were fleeing.]<br/><br/>We\u2019ve also had a lot of \u201cthere\u2019s no card for it\u201d\u2013action, like hiding in the water, weird uses of climbing and other things. Two of the players have never played an RPG or even a dungeon crawling board game like Descent or Adventure System, but they\u2019ve been creative when it comes to how they interact with the world. I\u2019ve tried to be clear that they can attempt whatever they want.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve played a lot of Adventure System and it\u2019s great to be free of the confinement of the cards. If the goal was seamless switching between \u201ccombat time\u201d and \u201croleplay time\u201d they\u2019ve succeeded \u2014 the game feels very homogenous.<br/><br/><br/>Even disregarding the Insp rules, Advantage/Disadvantage feels like the best of both worlds of Fate and non-Fate systems.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say the action was \u201cI want to climb on top of the monster and from there, stab her in the eye\u201d [taking the example from another recent thread].<br/><br/>In Fate, it could be \u201cUse Athletics to Create an Advantage, the monster can Defend using its own Athletics.

Great, it meant that you got a great attack roll which represent you stabbing it in the eye.\u201d<br/><br/>Of course, once you\u2019re all really familiar with how a game works, you don\u2019t have to speak everything out. But I haven\u2019t really gotten there with either game yet.<br/>What\u2019s cool to me is that the two situations are really doing the same thing but in 5e it\u2019s just stated more directly. Invocations and named aspects are the interface that Fate uses to achieve the same thing as 5e\u2019s Adv/Disadv: that things in the fiction have mechanical benefit no matter what weird and unforseen thing it was.<br/><br/>5e certainly owes a lot to Fate.

In two of them, we got through character acclimation (understanding pregens), explaining the basics of the rules, and the first two sections of the module (the ambush and the caves) plus a fair amount of role-playing in town after. In the third session, we did a lot of RP in town and went into the Redbrands hideout and cleared that out.<br/><br/>One solid 4-hour session is sufficient to take a 1st level character to 2nd level. The levels slow down after that.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to compare how your players handled combats, because while we had a fair amount of people falling to 0 hit points, we never felt threatened by a TPK. Even when one group decided to go one way (you know) instead of the other way (you know), didn't do it stealthily, and they got into a bad situation while getting whomped by a big monster (you know). Lots of unconscious PCs but I never felt like they wouldn't ultimately triumph there, and stabilization and magical healing fixed stuff pretty quickly.

Original post:\n<blockquote>Initiative is still a bit of a pain. I'm not really convinced of its value outside the tactical arena of 4e or even 3e. 5e combat is simple enough that there's seemingly not much value to tracking initiative order. Really, all you care about is who gets to attack before the monster on the first round, right? Then it's back and forth between monsters and PCs. Maybe with multiple monsters at different initiative times, that doesn't apply exactly, but I'd just use the boss for initiative and let everyone else attack at that time. Haven't tried it in actual play. I am pretty sure it'd make combat a lot faster. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>I'm not sold on this edition since it seems to fall prey to the same dissociated-mechanics-design-creep that started in 3E, but I'll keep reading.</blockquote>\nI know what you mean by the term "dissociate-mechanics-design-creep." I'm not sure I see a lot of it in 5e. Can you give me an example of a 5e rule that exhibits this?<br/><br/>For me, it's always been there in D&amp;D since the dawn of time. It's just abstraction. For some people and some rulesets, it goes too far. I think 4e went too far for most people. 3e seems to have hit it just right for a lot of people. I think 5e steps back toward 1e in terms of abstraction.<br/><br/>But let's be honest, hit points are a totally dissociated mechanic. Levels are a mostly dissociated mechanic.

I'm intrigued by the idea that you can use the binary switch to get around resource-hoarding and to encourage constant engagement of the BIFTs.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436390/#Comment_436390" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T13:06:36+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  1:06PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By binary, you mean that you either have Inspiration or you don't?

Sometimes, the bit that earns someone Inspiration is a five-word sentence that hits squarely on the BIFTs and then the player tentatively reaches for the red gem in the middle of the table while looking at me (the DM) for approval. In one or two instances, players actually awarded each other Inspiration without me-as-DM approving it.

So through play, you cycle through all four elements of your personal characteristics, earning four Inspiration (and spending four Inspiration, in the same earn-spend, earn-spend cycle as usual) before you can earn Inspiration for Traits again.<br/><br/>It forces people to play their Flaws, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436396/#Comment_436396" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T13:31:02+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  1:31PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's good that it's just one, we've had problems getting pool economy to work in the past.

The more I think about it, the more I believe 5e is just fine for Step On Up play. There are sufficient choices in chargen to support a strong "character build" mindset and a "strong party" mindset. The kill-loot-level cycle is strong, and there are interesting build choices at each level for Step On Up groups to grab onto. <br/><br/>The personality/Inspiration mechanics might be a distraction from that style of play, but they could also be a strong, strategic component of it, too. <br/><br/>I'm wondering if my Rorschach Test comment is more true than I thought.

It's abstract enough that you can't nail it down the how or why, but that's merely a sliding scale which is true of any rule in an RPG if you zoom in deeply enough or ask enough questions.<br/><br/>Hit points have a different problem where "they mean different things to different people", but they still directly represent a character's ability to remain standing after having suffered blows or trauma.<br/><br/>My sense from reading about the Inspiration rules in this thread is that this is a dissociated mechanic.  I said "creep" because it's a new rule, and this isn't the first edition I've followed since 3rd where I've noticed it.<br/><br/>Why is Inspiration dissociated?  Because there is no fictional justification for its use.  Why does the fighter get to use that inspiration point after a failed attack?  Because the player said so.  Really, that's it.  You could house rule Inspiration so that it's always associated.  In other words, require players to justify how their earning of the point specifically applies in the instance which they also use the point.  I just didn't get the sense from this thread that's how it works.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I don't mind dissociated mechanics in general, I just don't want them in my fantasy dungeoncrawl game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436498/#Comment_436498" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T22:13:09+00:00" title="August  5, 2014 10:13PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the <a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-same-page-tool/" rel="nofollow">comments sections of the Same Page Tool article</a>, some one asks if they can translate it.

or not tap *multiple* Aspects with each roll. I agree with you about "Insp before" in 5E though, partly for fiction-association reasons, and partly for mathematical reasons. There's a weird paradox here:<br/><br/>Let's say you have a 50% chance to hit on a particular roll. Rolling twice and taking the better one improves that to 75%. However, if you roll the first one and fail, and then roll the second one, guess what? Your chances haven't actually improved at all; the second roll is still only a 50-50 shot. Rolling both dice simultaneously is <i>actually</i> better than rolling them sequentially. (Though I agree that being able to roll the second one if you forgot that you had Ad/Dis is nice and convenient and tactile, and a better solution than just ignoring it entirely.)<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436571/#Comment_436571" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T10:22:36+00:00" title="August  6, 2014 10:22AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whaaaat?<br/><br/>No matter under what circumstances you roll 2d20, the chance that you get 11+ on one or both dice is 75%. <br/><br/>If you roll just one d20, you're at 50-50, yeah.<br/>If you fail, then you roll another d20, you're at 50-50 for that one, too.

Spending<br/>your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.<br/>[Emphasis added]<br/></blockquote>\n"When you make [a roll]..." could be interpreted as before, during, or after the die leaving your hand and hitting the table and coming to rest.<br/><br/>However, the way they use "when you roll" in the text seems to mean before and during, not after:\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you<br/>have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check,<br/>a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens,<br/>you roll a second d20 <b>when you make the roll</b>. Use the<br/>higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use<br/>the lower roll if you have disadvantage. <br/>[Emphasis added]</blockquote>\nStill, I think there's a decent case to argue that it could mean after.<br/><br/><br/>Possible scenario:<br/><br/>Player: "I waste him with my crossbow!"<br/>DM: "Hit AC 14?"<br/>Player: Rolls. "Drat! 10."<br/>DM: "You have advantage, remember."<br/>Player: Rolls another d20. "19!

Think about the way Bounded Accuracy works and the fact the Proficiency goes from +2 to +6 across the course of the entire game. That's pretty much the same mathematical spectrum covered by the original E6.<br/><br/>My personal opinion is that I wouldn't want to do it and don't think it's a good idea. It's true that spellcasters get somewhat "unbalanced" in some ways at higher levels, but I really don't like the idea of playing one knowing that I'm never going to get better than 3rd-level spells.<br/><br/>If you want a shorter campaign, just run a shorter campaign. YMMV, etc.<br/><br/>(I'm also kind of into the idea of starting at 2nd level and gaining 2 levels every time you would gain 1, possibly for a different XP cost, thus collapsing the game into 10 levels \xe0 la DW or 13A, because I think 1-10 is more feasible from a purely logistic point of view than 1-20.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438168/#Comment_438168" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-08T15:12:52+00:00" title="September  8, 2014  3:12PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like HP bloat though. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> Bounded Accuracy only addresses one issue (albeit a big one) out of several I have with high level play in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Looking at the free PDF...

First off, it has not been my experience that rolling lots of damage is what slowed down gameplay in 3.X and 4E. What made those games, especially the former, clunky was bonus- and buff-hunting, all the little stacking bullshit, you know. And that's pretty much all gone, especially because of concentration. So like, I don't get why it's bad design. But if it is such a problem for you, just play Dungeon World forever\u2014that's seriously not a bad choice.<br/><br/>Second, let's consider the various ways to make the higher levels feel genuinely different as you progress. Sure, it'd be cool if the non-caster classes got more flavorful things like battlefield command or whatever, but those sorts of things would non-trivially alter the entire tenor of play. And maybe that'd be a good thing. But it's not what 5E is aiming for. But you can't have some classes improve as they level up and not others.<br/><br/>Finally, Fighter is literally the only class that has this issue of multiple attacks, except for weird edge cases. No one else gets more than two. The game functions perfectly fine without Fighters.

They're not unrelated but they are different.<br/><br/>I think it's precisely *because* they deflated the other things that HP and Damage increases stayed relatively(1) intact. In 3E, the thing that distinguished non-casters from full casters, broadly speaking, was that the nons got full BAB. (This itself was a legacy from 2E and possibly before.) Fighters did get iterated attacks as they leveled up, but these extra attacks were less effective than they are in 5E, since each successive one was made at a -5 to hit. This was not only a paltry compensation for the insane levels of power casters were getting, it was *clunky*.<br/><br/>Now, *everyone* has, essentially, the same attack bonus progression. This is one of the things they essentially kept from 4E. But casters are getting the ability to throw around multiple dice of damage to multiple targets!<br/><br/>Of course, one could argue, why not deflate casters' high-end damage, thus obviating the need for Fighters to have multiple attacks and for monsters to have high HP? You could do that, but then you'd still want to give Fighters more attacks, for the simple reason that if all you did is pump their single attack's damage slightly, the swinginess of the d20 is going to nigh-guarantee un-fun for some players of Fighters.<br/><br/>Also, deflating casters' high-end damage is not so easy, because then you'd also have to severely decrease the power levels of their non-damaging spells, to keep relative parity.<br/><br/>But I still think the strongest argument here is an, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" one. Increasing damage and HP were simply *not* the major sources of problems in 3rd and 4th editions, they *are* an iconic part of D&amp;D, and so there's no need to be rid of them.<br/><br/>(1) It's also worth noting that the HP of the biggest monsters is far less than it was in 3rd or 4th, so there has been some not inconsiderable deflation here as well!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438228/#Comment_438228" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T14:58:58+00:00" title="September  9, 2014  2:58PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answer!<br/><br/>Worth thinking about.

By high levels many situations come down to SoD anyway due to magic, so HP are generally less important.<br/><br/>While I also agree that you want to be rewarded for gaining high levels with the feeling of being more powerful we need to remember that the comparisons have to be made intra-system. In other words, if we reduce the HPs available at most levels (so that characters have far fewer at say 5, 10, etc) then at the higher levels so long as we have more than we did earlier we'll still feel more powerful. It's only when we cap HPs somehow (so that we make gains for a while and then suddenly stop), or when we compare to other systems/editions (well in 3rd my fighter had 330hps instead of 90) that we feel like we aren't adequately high level. It's all about getting people used to the smaller numbers, just like they're forcing with BA.<br/><br/>When we did our houseruled version of D&amp;D we front-loaded considerably more on HPs, but then DRASTICALLY reduced HP gains (all characters max at 6 HD spread over the 36 levels). Of course this only worked well because we fundamentally changed armor as well, but the point is we greatly reduced the numbers while maintaining the equal escalation of power so that we didn't miss them.<br/><br/>I also don't feel that multiple attack iterations is a problem at all. It's never slowed things down significantly with us in any edition. The real issues have always been HP bloat and AC/attack bonus disparity. Those are the two that should be addressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438247/#Comment_438247" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-10T13:14:24+00:00" title="September 10, 2014  1:14PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just think iterative attack above 2 is a boring solution to a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place. =/<br/>I don't have much else to say on the topic of high level play except that my particular experience with it hasn't been fun and I don't see anything that makes me think it will be any different with 5e.

The idea that a round was 1 minute, an attack roll was merely that one perfect opportunity within that minute, HPs being an abstract, etc. Under those strictures iterative attacks suddenly make a LOT of sense. Of course a higher level combat expert will find more opportunities during a length exchange, and of course they'll more quickly strip away HPs (through exertion, determination, and apparent superiority if nothing else). <br/><br/>I think for many it comes down to rather people are ok with a 'hit it again' fighter, or rather they need powers/abilities/feats to find a fighter interesting at all. Most of the people I know who enjoy fighters in 1/2nd edition have no problems with iterations, while most who prefer later editions (especially 4th) like it less. Not always, but usually in my experience.<br/><br/>One thing I will say about 5th is that iterations mean something entirely different when you're dealing with advantage/disadvantage. In earlier editions there was usually quite a bit of missing going on, so having multiple rolls allowed a fighter to usually manage at least one hit per round without guaranteeing a steadily high damage output. Once you get a situation where you're fairly likely to hit anyway (as you are with advantage) multiple attacks may be overpowered. Conversely it may be a very effective way to overcome disadvantage, which can be a crippling penalty in an all-or-nothing situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438261/#Comment_438261" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T10:28:40+00:00" title="September 11, 2014 10:28AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">@Caoimhe</a> posted on her FB about how broken the druid is at 2nd level.

On the off choice that I'm wrong, the download here says a Black bear has AC 11 and 19 hit points, which sounds like an invitation to be hit a lot.  They do get to hit twice a round (at +3) but a druid out of the box should be attacking with a +4 with their Shillelagh cantrip powering their club anyway.  Even if a Black Bear is valid for a second level druid, I think that low AC is a big disincentive from using that form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deinol" title="deinol"><img alt="deinol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deinol">deinol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438272/#Comment_438272" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T14:45:51+00:00" title="September 11, 2014  2:45PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two attacks at +3 are far better than one attack at +4.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still not convinced.  We had a druid in our party last night, and yes, he turned into a bear... and yes, suddenly everyone was aiming at the big scary target.  He went from 34 to 14 hit points in one round before the other players finished off the bad guys.  Meanwhile I'm only occasionally getting pinged and running around the battlefield like a maniac, hitting two or three times a round, and next week I'll be able to sneeze fire at people.<br/><br/>I suppose a limiting factor on the bear right now is that our enemies tend to have 5 hp.  It doesn't matter if you do 12 hp a blow at first level if you only need 5 or 9.<br/><br/>But we'll continue to play, and I'll continue to keep an eye on the druid. It's not hard, he keeps borrowing my PHB. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438310/#Comment_438310" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-12T15:58:21+00:00" title="September 12, 2014  3:58PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran it for another group tonight, and it was the first time I made a wilderness of my own, with some town adventures and a few dungeons. So far, D&amp;D 5e is consistently been giving me the best DM experiences I have ever had in my whole life. So I\u2019m likely to become even more biased and blind to its faults.<br/>To be honest, those experiences are perhaps less 5e itself and more just reading/hearing good DM advice such as Red Tide\u2019s \u201cHouses of the Lost\u201d, Clint Krause\u2019s \u201cDamn Good D&amp;D\u201d, Mike Shea\u2019s \u201cThe Lazy DM\u201d etc.<br/>But 5e is still hanging on to its spot as my favorite edition. Tonight, with this new group (at a small local con), the Inspiration stuff really sang. The backgrounds came into play in a good way. And of course The Lost Mine of Phandelver has been very instructional and a \u201csafe\u201d for me to learn to DM. Very happy.<br/><br/>I learned that I should\u2019ve printed out the backgrounds, especially for a con game. I used the method of backgroundless pregen + background. (I.e. someone chose the premade human wizard and chose sailor to add to that.) The pregens were printed but the backgrounds were only in the PHB which meant that they had to pass it around and do it one at a time, which took time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19622/d-d-5e-first-thoughts-after-playtest/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19622/d-d-5e-first-thoughts-after-playtest">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19622/d-d-5e-first-thoughts-after-playtest/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19622/d-d-5e-first-thoughts-after-playtest/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19622/d-d-5e-first-thoughts-after-playtest/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19622%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19622%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
