Take your organization, figure out what the defining characteristic of somebody in that organization must be, then have the players explain how that defining characteristic comes out through the lens of their character.<br/><br/>For instance, the Green Lantern Corps requires that one be fearless. Above all else, the rings themselves require that a potential Lantern never let fear stop them. So what does this look like when it\u2019s played out among some of the biggest names?<br/><br/>Hal Jordan \u2013 Fear is a drug to him, he\u2019s an adrenaline junkie. He gets into planes that barely work to go faster than humans ever should because it is only when he\u2019s freaking out that he\u2019s happiest. This is probably because, after losing his dad, he figures he doesn\u2019t have much to lose. He\u2019d be right if he didn\u2019t continue to amass loved ones.<br/><br/>Guy Gardner \u2013 Guy strikes me as the kind of guy that was afraid a lot as a kid and developed a lot of bluster to cover it up. At some point, the bluster became his actual personality and so whenever he starts to feel afraid he just becomes more Guy-esque. He responds to fear with anger and being obnoxious; he essentially makes his personality bigger than the fear.<br/><br/>G\u2019nort \u2013 Obviously too damn dumb to realize there\u2019s anything of which to be afraid.<br/><br/>Sinestro \u2013 Literally and honestly thinks he\u2019s the biggest bad ass in the universe. Nothing in Sinestro\u2019s world is scarier than Sinestro. The worst part is, he\u2019s pretty close to right.<br/><br/>Soranik Natu \u2013 A neurosurgeon, she manipulates the smallest and most sensitive parts of her patients and holds their lives in her hands every single day. She\u2019s calm, cool, utterly professional and handles her fear by putting it behind that wall of professionalism.<br/><br/>Also, once you know what the real defining factor is (in this case, fearlessness) you know where to twist the knife. Hit Sinestro in his ego, lay out obvious trails to follow for G\u2019nort, put Guy in situations where delicacy is important, and endanger Hal\u2019s loved ones, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Thoughts and comments?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288988/#Comment_288988" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T12:57:40+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 12:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got this game called <i>Hex Rangers</i> that's about a secret government organization fighting supernatural forces in the Old West. All the PCs are members of this organizationg (the USHR).<br/><br/>The first thing I do when sitting down to play it with new people is explain the baseline of that a Hex Ranger is. They are <i>all</i> trained to shoot, ride, and survive in the wilderness, as well as to work magic. So you don't have to put anything on your character sheet about these unless you want to be particularly good at it or do it in a special style.<br/><br/>The second thing is to start actually creating the character, which begins with a discussion of who the character was before he was chosen to become a member of the USHR. To be a candidate for the USHR, you must have had an encounter with a supernatural evil, and comported yourself admirably (just <i>surviving</i> is admirable). I ask the player what they encountered and what happened. (There's a lot of stuff that happens in this step re: getting everyone on the same page as far as what the supernatural looks like and how it behaves in our game, too.)<br/><br/>By the time that's done with, the player's gotten pretty well into the character's head, and then it's time to stat them up. They've got two different kinds of stats: one is a set of betting limits (for the poker-style resolution) in four categories (vigor, wits, touch, sand), allowing you to personalize your character's approach <i>in the most general sense</i>. The second kind of stat is freeform traits that describe what about your character sets him apart from the Hex Ranger baseline.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289001/#Comment_289001" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T14:11:01+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  2:11PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting answers, all. I'm looking at the minor differences and wondering how they can be lensed/exploded to be interesting and come up in play, as well as how to put pressure on the things they do well. Putting pressure on that stuff and seeing how they do something--not how well they do it, is an interesting difference to me. <br/><br/>Josh Unruh: Well presented, I like those ideas.<br/><br/><br/>Marshall: Need playtesters for Hex Rangers? (I've got friends who love Wild West+Horror, but not fans of Deadlands) I was working on my own more "black magic+occasional old world supernatural or new world monster" game called Whispered West but its on the back burner a ways.<br/><br/>I was thinking of Smallville as a start, but I may use something else as well. Hearts &amp; Souls 2E is more focused on the superheroes drive--why they do what they do--and that plus triggers is a big way to create differences in play. I do like to play games I didn't write however, so I'm always poking and picking things up, plus examining what I could write specifically for a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289004/#Comment_289004" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T14:23:16+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  2:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville will give you the cool relationships but not the organizational side of things directly.
