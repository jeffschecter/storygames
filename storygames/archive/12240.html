And the Target Numbers seem really "borked" as Judd put it.  <br/><br/>Here is a link to the AP, in case you want see where the fiction is meeting the mechanics:<br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=512320" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=512320</a><br/><br/>The players are consistently hitting the TNs.  The constantly help each other out, which I like quite a bit and do NOT want to discourage.  But am a bit concern in order to challenge them, I might have to build really uber foes... and that just doesn't seem to work in the fiction of the world.  Sure, occasionally an uber foe is cool.  <br/><br/>I'm considering raising all the TNs of the skill checks by 2.<br/><br/>Conan/Elric/Solomon Kane/ Grey mouser &amp; Fafhrd, these are tough PCs to model in an RPG... they've got to be very bad-ass, but beatable. That is a tough tight rope to walk for an RPG, it so IS NOT the 4th Ed d20 model, where things scale up to the level of the PC.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274442/#Comment_274442" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T06:30:19+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  6:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2010 6:31AM by Andy.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At first, I was thinking "Are you actually using hard difficulty numbers, and not just the default of '9'?", but then I saw at least two instances of you making the target number "15", where they succeeded.

We did have the "too easy to succeed" problem with SoTC (IMO). I think it may be partly because of GMs who are afraid to kill off PCs, being conditioned from a lot of games where this is a pretty common occurence.

I tell them up front if you enter this conflict and you lose, unless something dramatic changes, you will die.  Otherwise I tie them up, leave them for dead, humiliate them in the eyes of their peers,e etc.  There are some things much, much worse than death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274557/#Comment_274557" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T12:48:31+00:00" title="June  4, 2010 12:48PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed this sort of problem with PDQ, too -- in my first session running S7S, no one got any training points despite there being two combats (admittedly, the first was just against minions).  In the second session, I kicked up the difficulties a bit, which helped.  I did find focused NPC built using the PC rules could be pretty dangerous.  Also, armor.  Also ""Quantity has a quality all its own."  If there's enough foes, they all have to fight them individually.  As for environmental challenges, if they're really good, then the environment should challenge them in ways lesser mortals would have no chance of surviving.  <br/><br/>Take all this with a grain of salt, of course, as I have less PDQ GMing experience than you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274650/#Comment_274650" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T00:47:58+00:00" title="June  5, 2010 12:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2010 12:48AM by Tim_Gray.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, a few thoughts.

They are big flags waving showing me what the players are interested in.  Especially with the idea of a Quality being downgraded first in a conflict leads to a story hook.  So to put up conflicts that do not involve their Qualities on purpose seems to be a bit at odds with how I GM.  <br/><br/>If the situation develops naturally... then it isn't so much a problem for me.  <br/><br/>But they made well rounded characters and they knew the premise of the game going in (tame a wild town).  So their Qualities often overlap and I don't have a problem with that.  <br/><br/>I really think it might be the team up rules that are a bit borked, but I definitely do NOT want to take away team up rules.  It is such a part of this trio, no one fights alone in the Grey Legion has become a rallying cry and a way of life.  <br/><br/>Hmmm... I've a bit to think on before my next game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274674/#Comment_274674" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-05T09:53:12+00:00" title="June  5, 2010  9:53AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could try a variant where, rather than adding all their MODs, each helper who has a relevant Quality contributes a flat +2. (Or Upshift, but that could get into a multi-dice extravaganza very quickly.)<br/><br/>In Wordplay, which is of a similar ilk, Graham has specified that a character can use no more than two supporting abilities of their own, and I think each helper does give a flat bonus (maybe having to roll themselves to achieve it... it's a while since I've played). That sort of approach might actually do a lot to make a game feel darker/grittier/more grounded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274828/#Comment_274828" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T06:52:16+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  6:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Judd and I talked a bit more about your idea Tim on IM.

"helpful".<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>I think I will expand the Fortune pts that if anyone on the team spends a Fortune pt during that "Helping" than everyones Qualities that they can bring to bear are fair game in the exchange.
