Like many other players in my early groups, I got into the habit of treating every new piece of fiction introduced by the GM as a potential threat.  There was theorizing and measuring and strategizing galore, because these threats were serious!  Make a wrong move, and my precious character might be killed, or imprisoned, or level-drained, or might lose my favorite magic items!  The way we played, the point of playing was pretty much to avoid those fates -- to stay alive long enough to prosper and become badass enough to fight the coolest beasties in the Monster Manual.  Getting killed or jailed or robbed felt like losing, and so we all tried to win instead.  Given that my only tool (well, besides criticizing the GM) was my character, there was an exact correspondence in adversity -- if my character's in trouble, <b>I'm</b> in trouble.  If they're faced with loss, I dread that loss and do everything I can to avoid it.  If they've got a problem, yo, I'll solve it.  That's what I'm here to do, to sweat the adversity.<br/><br/>My foray into indie RPGs 15 years later introduced me to an extremely different formula.  Playing Primetime Adventures at my first convention, I saw the players around me gleefully leading their characters into peril.  They relished the tight spots <i>while they were happening</i>.  This was a bit of a shock!  I'd only relished tight spots <i>after</i> the fact, in celebration of victory, or in contemplation of avenging loss.  "Now my character has this juicy choice to make" was a concept I quickly bought into over the course of 3 hours, seeing how everyone at the table perked up and took notice at those moments, despite the fact that dismemberment wasn't on the line, and no one was losing too much sweat in trying to avoid it even if it was.<br/><br/>Since then, I've played many sessions of many games with an attitude of "embrace character trouble".  It turns out that metagame resources, authority beyond what my character does, peril that doesn't involve losing life or levels, and one-shot games with characters I'll never play again, are all pretty common occurrences in the circles I've played in.  My earlier habit of "fear the GM's threats and fight like hell to avoid/overcome them" is long since dead, with "embrace character trouble" just as natural to me at this point.<br/><br/>This is where it gets interesting.  Instead of having one default attitude to take into all RPGs, I've wound up with this huge bag of different approaches informed by different experiences, so that when I see a new game, I'm playing mix-and-match.  Sometimes consciously, sometimes not.  When my character is going to unseal that vault, and I hear the guards' footsteps in the distance, how will I respond?<br/><br/>"Oh crap, if they show up they might imprison me, or kill me if I resist!  Can't have that!  Must run!  Must hide!  Or can I trick them somehow?!"<br/><br/>"Oh cool, if they show up then I'll get to deal with this quandary!  Maybe I'll wind up scarred by 20 years in prison, or maybe I'll recruit them as henchman for my upcoming coup!  Neato!"<br/><br/>Until I see the new game's feedback and rewards and consequences in action, I'm just guessing at what will be most fun, right now, with the group I'm playing with.  If the game doesn't push us in a particular direction, we'll wind up doing what comes naturally, based on prior experience and how we play together.  When I try out a new game, I <i>hope</i> that it <i>does</i> provide such a  push -- otherwise, I'd be more likely to play a game I already know instead.  However, having become aware of my options, at this point only the strongest pushes register.  If I'm with an "embrace trouble" group in an "embrace trouble" mood, <i>encouraging</i> or <i>allowing</i> me to sweat adversity simply isn't enough.  The adversity needs teeth, for real, non-negotiably, in a way that no player can dodge without cheating.  Similarly, if my group is all geared up to sweat adversity, we're not going to stop strategizing and simply embrace trouble unless the game truly rewards us for playing that way.<br/><br/>So, what do you all think?  Have you experienced this freedom to process RPG "adversity" however you like?  If so, is it a good thing, a problem, or both?  Do you intuit how a game "wants" you to play it?  Do you have enough game options that distinguish themselves via powerful incentives, and do you continue to find more?  Or do they all blend together to the point where you don't care about stakes and resolution outcomes, and you find the fun in other aspects of a game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422796/#Comment_422796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T15:28:12+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  3:28PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2013 3:29PM by catty_big.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The indie attitude, as I see it, is that no outcome is either good or bad- at least not in the traditional sense- because the roleplaying and the narrative are more important than 'winning' or 'losing'; also, every outcome adds to the fiction being created, so you can't really win or lose in indie games. Forex, I played Robin Laws' new game Hillfolk this afternoon, and at the end my character died- poisoned while attempting to poison another character- and I accepted it because it made the story interesting. Does that mean that I'm not invested in my character? That I don't care whether 'my guy' lives or dies? Not at all, it's just that I recognise that there's a greater objective in play, that of the overall narrative. Not sure if that helps you at all, but that's my two cents FWIW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422797/#Comment_422797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T15:42:04+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  3:42PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2013 3:58PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said!

There's something fun about scrambling to find an answer your character can maybe live with even though it's clearly wrong and terrible and not what anyone would willingly choose if there were better alternatives. I can get into the desperation that makes a character dig himself in deeper and deeper because it's the only direction left to him.<br/><br/>I can't do nothing but tight spots with no good answers for weeks on end (and maybe not even for a full four-hour game session, if I'm being brutally honest), but as far as exciting, climactic, memorable conflicts go, it's great. Better than just putting the character's life at stake, by far: if you really want me to get sucked into a scene, just put my character in a tight spot with only bad choices left to him and I'll have a fantastic time with it.<br/><br/>Just, y'know, be aware that at some point I'm going to get exhausted by the awfulness and will want the game to let me play happiness and fun again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422821/#Comment_422821" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T01:23:12+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  1:23AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it makes me "out" of the game, I'll want to avoid trouble. As long as I'm still in it (or it's near the end of the session and I won't be "out" for long), I tend to go for whichever is better for the story and more fun or interesting for the group as a whole. Sometimes, this means up to and including death for my character.... unless I'm very attached to them (in which case, it goes into risk-management mode).<br/><br/>The integrity of the story is my main concern. I have maneuvered my characters into bad situations intentionally (sometimes having spent several sessions to do so). I've likewise spent several sessions working to put other characters into terrible situations. All of this because it seemed "right" for characters and story direction.<br/><br/>If getting in trouble leads to things that would make the game less fun for the group as a whole (for example - getting in trouble might lead to changing the tone of the game from friendly adventuring to "crap, now we have to deal with a race war between humans and elves... <i>thanks</i>", or losing a level may make it difficult for the group to survive the next challenge) then it's certainly a big deterrent towards taking those risks or exploring that possibility of the story.<br/><br/>If something my character would do risks compromising the fun/interest of the story, I'll generally take it to meta. "Hey guys, if you don't stop my character, X is going to happen." And I'm perfectly fine with suggesting ways for the other players to avert the potential crisis, ex: "If you tell him [whatever], he'll agree with your plan." But I'm not going to just go, "Well, I'll go against six sessions of established behavior for my character and ignore this because it's inconvenient." <br/><br/>I've rarely played in games where things like permanently losing benefits was on the table. Usually, it was something that could be regained through the story (ie: a quest), expired after a certain amount of game-time, or (possibly) replaced with something else I wanted/my character wanted. So, in the end, the idea of my character's problem being my problem isn't very familiar to me. Even character death usually has some sort of "out" possibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422829/#Comment_422829" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T08:51:04+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  8:51AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things: Reinforcement and Victory conditions. If you see everyone on the table having fun for cleverly putting your character on the spot to make the overall story more interesting, you start to relax and have fun that way, that's positive reinforcement of an attitude. If everyone is scared about seeing their characters die, you may probably start to care more about it, and this isn't exactly equal to character investment -I've seen players invest less in their characters for the fear of seeing them gone on a bad roll- but more like investing in protecting your fun, your link to the game, group and fiction. That's more like negative reinforcement, in terms of having players actively create a story instead of just following it and make choices.<br/><br/>About Victory conditions, these doesn't always are what the game states, specially in RPGs where rules mosto of the time doesn't state them. It's more like a perceived thing, players will create their own by what they infere from the group dynamic. Tes there might be victory conditions inside the fiction, but outside there might be different ones and they will take precedence over the former.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422840/#Comment_422840" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T13:34:59+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  1:34PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This conversation seems related to Vincent Baker's recent posts on what the object of a game is. See, for example: <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/744" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/744</a><br/><br/>I've played games where the object of the game is not clear to (or understood to be shared by) all players at the table, so by default, most of my friends gravitate toward a D&amp;D-inspired mindset that "victory" for characters is equivalent to "winning" for players. I've been trying to introduce my friends to other kinds of systems that incentivize complicating PCs' lives, like granting them Fate Points for accepting complications or failure, or running dramatic one-shots where they go in knowing that tragedy or death is part of the goal. I'm not sure if the attitude that character problem \u2260 player problem will translate back to games with less clearly stated objects/goals, but it's definitely giving us something to talk about and expanding the kinds of play we do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422859/#Comment_422859" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T21:00:29+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  9:00PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...in Call of Cthulhu!<br/><br/>(in response to the thread title, and with tongue firmly in cheek)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422863/#Comment_422863" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T21:08:27+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  9:08PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's worth noting that this issue is one of the major controversies surrounding capital-N Narrativism and indie gaming.

Sometimes it can be really jarring!

An outcome that's bad for my character and good for an exciting story isn't necessarily unwelcome, and it may not change my behavior the way the designer hopes it will.  Vincent and I had a long argument about this -- he kept saying, "See, you wouldn't want <i>this</i> to happen!" and I kept saying, "That's not actually true.  My AW character is a ruthless bastard and I kinda <i>want</i> some dramatic badness to happen to him."<br/><br/>Personally, I get most invested in my character's fate going a certain way when I myself am applying my efforts toward that end.  If it doesn't take effort, or if I'm flexible about where it goes, then it's hard to effectively threaten me.  This is fine sometimes, but other times I <i>want</i> a game to threaten me, y'know?<br/><br/>I'm not just talking about threats of death and efforts to survive.  A failed objective is an excellent threat.  Part of what I like about <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is that you can fail to fix the town by doing too little, or you can fail to fix the town by doing too much.  Once I'm hell bent on fixing the town, those risks are effective threats.

I'm guessing you've played it (Pandemic is another example). It's not a roleplaying game, but I'm using it to better point out how it could work, and also because very few roleplaying games (no English ones anyway) are using this to it's fully extent. It doesn't have to be the game versus the players, but it's one example at least.<br/><br/>To make the story go in certain way can sometimes be what the game master is invested in, but that's a side track, because you're clearly talking about the players. When I write about fighting for the story, I had in mind a tug of war between the participants (with no game master) to make their story be the dominant. You could also collaborate to make all story elements work together, and that takes effort too, often in combination of the game rules.

In some games, harm to your character (whether physical, material, or through loss of NPCs he cares about, etc.) is <i>supposed</i> to be unwelcome. And if it's not, if you relish bad things happening to your character, then perhaps there's a mismatch between the game's design goals and your preferences or your psychological makeup vis-a-vis your RPG characters.<br/><br/>But this certainly isn't a universal principle, and in some games the unwelcome might be the exact opposite! Fiasco, for instance: the mechanics could dictate a positive outcome for someone we hate.<br/><br/>Paul T \u2014 Polaris is a super-interesting example. The mechanics are very meta in how you use them, but you definitely are supposed to use them to advocate for your character when you're the Heart. I think it's a very understandable mix-up.<br/><br/>My biggest crash and burn with Polaris came when I did too good a job, as Mistaken, of making the Heart I was playing against despair and want to end her life. We were still, by the rules, at least a few rounds of scenes away from the possibility of her dying. But the in-fiction situation had grown so grim that she just wanted to commit suicide.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422909/#Comment_422909" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T08:57:55+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  8:57AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's easy to imagine a group of D&amp;D players approaching the game as though it was CoC.

For example, many games give you experience points for doing X, but it's not uncommon for players to get into just playing the game and ignore the point rewards (or even to deliberately avoid point rewards). Players just differ in what they find rewarding. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422938/#Comment_422938" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T18:25:28+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  6:25PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I hear you, Dave.

Some are more or less consistent than others - but I believe that has to do with genre, color, and expectation as much as direct incentives.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423143/#Comment_423143" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T12:18:39+00:00" title="October 18, 2013 12:18PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this thread, I realize that I have three distinct modes in roleplaying: <br/>1) Playing my character as someone who wants to realize their goals and avoid bad stuff without being <b>too </b>much of a villain along the way, i.e. conventional morality.  <br/>2) What I think of as "Amber mode" -- playing a character who wants something really, really strongly and will do whatever it takes to get there.  This is fun in very specific contexts, like in games of Amber, Vampire, Sorcerer etc. In many games, this kind of character doesn't work too well and acts as a buzzkill.  <br/>3) The third mode is a lot like the first one, but minus the stuff about avoiding villainy.  Basically playing a opportunist.  This works well for Apocalypse World, WFRP, etc, or in games where it seems fun to play the bad cop or semi-reformed villain of the group.<br/><br/>That's really about it; I pick from that limited palette of character types mostly based on the expectations of that game and that group of players, without much consideration of mechanical rewards, usually.  I'm not very good at shaping my play to maximize mechanical advantage, though; in AW-type games, I always end up rolling with the stats that aren't highlighted and don't get as many XP as the other players.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423225/#Comment_423225" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-20T22:11:23+00:00" title="October 20, 2013 10:11PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I guess "type of character" is tied into "player relationship to character" and thus investment.

In a one-shot, it feels like less of a big deal if your character gets totally screwed as long as it's interesting. When I ran a Dust Devils one-shot, for instance, my friend had a blast playing a deputy fallen from grace into drinking \u2013 and finally sacrificing himself in the final scene to take out all the bad guys. The PC "prevailed" by redeeming himself with his sacrifice; the player "prevailed" by having his character go through a dramatic arc, go down in a blaze of glory, and bring it to a Western-movie-style conclusion. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423271/#Comment_423271" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-21T22:51:16+00:00" title="October 21, 2013 10:51PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One shots are an interesting beast.

The problem you've highlighted IMO is the fact that most people playing in most games of CoC know right from the start that they're all going to die horribly, they're just playing to find out how. Whether or not that's counter-immersive (which is what we're kinda skating around in this thread) is open to question, but it does make for a sort of curds and whey type separation of player and character. Whether <i>that</i>'s a problem I'm not sure, I don't think it would be for me but, as I say, COC is a bit of a special case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424985/#Comment_424985" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T16:29:58+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  4:29PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought just occurred to me.  Some RPGs have game goals that are completely different than the goals a player adopts when making character decisions.  This can produce a tension where investing too much in one goal ruins enjoyment of the other goal.  See: every RPG session where a player is obsessed with their character succeeding but the game produces stories more than winners and losers.<br/><br/>Perhaps a clearer example is the game Telephone.  The point of playing is to receive a hilariously garbled message at the end, and the formal procedures are a series of whispers.  But there's another rule, which instructs you to <i>Try to repeat the message faithfully.</i>  Even though that's the <i>opposite</i> of why you're playing!<br/><br/>I see some value in this rule -- without being given the goal of "repeat faithfully", players would just garble at will, and there'd be nothing to struggle against or contend with.  But in practice, I've noticed two things:<br/><br/>1) It's possible to get a message all the way through un-garbled, and when this happens, the result is no fun.<br/><br/>2) It's possible to cheat, forgo struggle, garble at will, and have <i>more</i> fun, as long as people garble subtly rather than just making stuff up.  In effect, they're better able to pursue the object of the <i>game</i> if they reject the momentary object of their assigned <i>task</i>.<br/><br/>When an RPG encourages you to play a rational, motivated character, and gives you the tools to optimize their decisions toward achieving their ends... and then tells you "play with a bunch of folks for the purpose of seeing what happens to y'all's characters"... then it's natural to, y'know, cheat at Telephone.  <br/><br/>At the extreme: Why seriously advocate for my dude if "what happens" looks neater when my guy acts like a moron?<br/><br/>At less of an extreme: I'm seriously advocating for my dude, but with a bit of a wink and an awareness that bad shit for him is often good for the game.<br/><br/>The point: a ruleset (e.g. a conflict system) may have pretty solid incentives <i>within the context of that system</i>, but if those don't <i>also</i> relate to the <i>point of play</i>, there's still a risk of character investment falling flat.  If you want to prioritize character investment, it may be best to have your Task Objects support your Game Objects directly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424995/#Comment_424995" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-29T20:38:24+00:00" title="November 29, 2013  8:38PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, Dave.
