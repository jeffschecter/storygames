Borrowed <i>Sufficiently Advanced</i> from my buddy Peter and talked the Thu Crew (Eric Boyd, Lxndr Cherry, Peter Aronson, Jason Furedy and me this time; missing a couple of our regulars this summer) into giving it a go.<br/><br/>I wrote this as a journal of sorts, in real time, as I worked through learning and then playing the game. Apologies if it\u2019s a bit disjointed.<br/><br/><b>First Impressions</b><br/>There is a lot of background, and I\u2019m not persuaded by all of the Civilizations and Societies after a first read. I suspect the setting is meant to be used in a toolbox-y way, but they\u2019re presented very holistically. There\u2019s even a chart showing relationships between every civilization. To my eyes, that strongly implies it\u2019s meant to be read and played as a whole. Rumor has it Colin\u2019s working on a supplement with even more background material. Wow. Quite the throwback to the good old days of RPGs, huh?<br/><br/>The core conceit of the game works pretty well: the Transcendentals, AI superminds who receive incomplete information from their future selves, are trying to engineer their Desired Future. Basically, the Desired Future is what they feel to be a best-case-scenario for both AI and human life. The baked-in assumption is that the Ts are good guys and the Desired Future is not, in fact, a Matrix/Terminator scenario.<br/><br/>So the game looks like it\u2019s basically a mission-driven game, with an unreliable Boss-type character at the top (think Lacuna, 3:16, Agon, arguably Mouse Guard if you play Gwendolyn as something other than all-knowing and all-wise). It doesn\u2019t look to be much of a character-driven game. Also, the tension between the mission and the unreliable Boss wasn\u2019t clear to me \u2018til I read through Colin\u2019s \u201c<a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com/briefing" rel="nofollow">briefing generator</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com/situation" rel="nofollow">situation generator</a>\u201d and saw that they created lots of nice tension. In fairness, there is some discussion of Transcendental weirdness in the text. I still feel like the briefing/situation generator stuff is indispensable.<br/><br/>That said, characters do have Core Values. Some are derived from their Civilization and/or their Society. Others are player-picked. Those CVs have both positive and negative mechanical impacts in play, so I think you can treat them as Flags. <br/><br/>Mechanically there are several interesting things going on at once. The rules feature a clear divide between character rules and player rules, and as you opt for more effectiveness on one side you are opting for less effectiveness on the other. The character rules are pretty standard RPG fare: you have stats, you have skills (really families of skills, presented as \u201cprofessions\u201d), and you have your Core Values, which give you direct mechanical bonuses when you engage them in play. The player rules are a bit more interesting: Every character gets points to divide amongst their Themes. These are player-level effects that allow you to immediately trump whatever is going on in the fiction. So like Plot Immunity is one of the Themes \u2013 it\u2019s a no-bullshit, get-out-of-jail-free card. It\u2019s for resolving what appears to be an unresolveable problem in the game: you\u2019re about to fall into a star, thousands of guns are trained on you, you have no way to get out of something. There are others \u2013 Magnetism is your NPC-making theme, Comprehension is your just-give-me-an-answer-already Theme, and so on. <br/><br/>Also of interest is the extended conflict system. Colin\u2019s built a system in which conflicts can be nested within conflicts. But resolving it involves multiplication as well as managing your Reserve, which is a combined hit point and hero point pool. At first blush, it looks like spending Reserve is a fairly obvious choice: if you can spend fewer Reserve than the damage you can do to the other guy, you\u2019re always better off doing it. That doesn\u2019t strike me as an interesting decision to make in play. Maybe it\u2019ll look different after I\u2019ve played it.<br/><br/><b>After Character Creation</b><br/>Once we actually made characters, I really appreciated the balance between character-level rules (Capabilities, Core Values and Professions) and player-level rules (Themes and Complications). It seems that the game is trying to provide something to both trad gamers who want badass characters and indie story gamers who want lots of hands-on control over the story.<br/><br/>I think we\u2019ve identified a few unfortunate gaps in the rules:<br/><br/>Story Triggers: great idea, we\u2019re very excited about them, but they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll work. First off, there is no meaningful guidance for how to create the elements of a Story Trigger. Honestly we see no motive for a player to create a Story Trigger element that isn\u2019t extremely positive. Czege Principle problems here. Which, I suppose, means the GM is motivated to spend Complications on screwing them up. Mostly there's just not much guidance to how to make them produce good play. They read like untested beta rules.<br/><br/>We didn\u2019t get how to use the Technology chapter. Quick scan of the wiki explained somewhere that it\u2019s not really meant to be used as a shopping list, but rather what is assumed to be possible at various tech levels. However, there are also occasional mentions of money and value and wealth, and they don\u2019t map in any clear way to the Technology chapter. Like, \u201cHigh Society\u201d members apparently can acquire expensive stuff. But the stuff in the Technology chapter kind of doesn\u2019t have expense attached to it \u2013 at least not as it\u2019s described in High Society. Probably just some bad editing. We worked it out.<br/><br/>I\u2019m starting to have reservations about the extended conflict system. Looks fussier every time I read through it again.<br/><br/>Continued...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228472/#Comment_228472" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:16:46+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 1:17PM by PaulB.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Prior to First Play</b><br/>Polished up my <a href="http://www.z-com.com/stcribsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">Story Triggers crib sheet</a>. Got Colin\u2019s imprimatur over at <a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com" rel="nofollow">the wiki.</a><br/><br/>Based on the work I did on unpacking Story Triggers, I built a few Triggers out. My sense of the rules is that they\u2019re intended to formally put everything the GM has in mind out on the table. That means the players can touch on (i.e. edit) everything as well \u2013 sort of! The GM can also elect to hide trigger elements and reveal them pretty much whenever he wants. <br/><br/>I generated a situation and a briefing using Colin\u2019s Reign-inspired generators. They produced a good first go. Then I Story-Triggered the result and turned it into four Elements. At that point, I then took a hard look at each player\u2019s Core Values (and civs and societies) to make a bunch more. Since I had added some new material and concepts to the Story Triggers rules, I wanted to give them a try. So I made four more triggers. One of them, I completely wrote out \u2013 it was basically a second pathway off the first briefing/situation, a wildly different alternative that incorporated stuff staked out by a couple of the characters\u2019 Core Values. The last three, each keyed to combinations of two characters\u2019 CVs (so as to create opportunity for intraparty conflict), I built out and then semi-randomly determined which Element to reveal. I tread the revealed Elements like bait, and wanted to see how the players would react to these compelling, confusing little tidbits.<br/><br/>Reviewed the resolution system. There\u2019s nothing about SA, on first blush, that prompts one to ask Transhumanism-themed questions. Really the resolution system is pretty standard stuff: roll one of your stats + a suitable skill, compare results, pound on each other\u2019s \u201creserve\u201d (both your \u201chit points\u201d and your \u201chero points\u201d system for boosting individual die results). <br/><br/>I think the Transhuman-y stuff is going to come from the narrative possibilities presented in how stats are described (they\u2019re five broad areas of technology), the Technology chapter at the end of the book (which turns out to be something of an extension of the explanation of the stats, as well as a recap of the various setting-wide technologies that have shaped the setting),  and acceptable victory results from the extended conflict system. But as far as specifically addressing or challenging the themes of Transhumanism itself, that\u2019s on the GM to bring to the fore. There\u2019s a void, but it doesn\u2019t look especially fruitful.<br/><br/>Exception: the character\u2019s Core Values. There are a lot of very provocative Core Values cooked right into the cultures that you choose, as well as the Societies. I think a lot of Transhuman thematic play will bubble up as a result of attacking CVs.<br/><br/>SA is also very standard in its old-school approach: Here\u2019s a huge pile of material you (specifically, the GM) will need to learn before you can really dig into the game. There isn\u2019t much make-it-up-as-you-go scifi goodness like you get in Shock: (minutiae) or Burning Empires (Tech Burner).<br/><br/>It looks to me, prior to first play, like the most innovative elements of SA aren\u2019t the themes but the meta-mechanics of play: Themes, Complications and Story Triggers. All cool ways for the players to put their hands directly on the steering wheel of play. But again, there\u2019s no real thematic connection between these mechanics and what SA is supposed to be addressing. I think this could easily be ported into any RPG setting.<br/><br/>Continued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228473/#Comment_228473" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:17:15+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>First Play</b><br/>Initial impressions:<br/><br/><i>I hate the extended conflict system.</i> Hate. It. Two reasons: the system requires you multiply your stat by your die roll and use THAT number. I don\u2019t get that, and I\u2019m not a fast multiplier. Every time the dice hit the table, I feel stupid. Second reason: each roll doesn\u2019t really look like anything in the fiction. It\u2019s just a rolling contest \u2013 and a long one at that. If you\u2019re using very high stats and professions, you might be looking at pounding through 15 to 30 reserve points. At 2-4 reserve damage per roll, only on the defender\u2019s side and only if you win, you\u2019re looking at a LOT of rolling.<br/><br/>Theoretically, being able to nest smaller fights inside of bigger fights looks nifty. But a) that just makes it even longer and b) all you get from nesting is more Reserve for your big fight, which makes it EVEN LONGER. There are no meaningful fictional consequences for outcomes of nested fights \u2013 it\u2019s all abstracted to the Reserve bonus you get.<br/><br/>Based on the fussiness and general slowness of extended conflict, it looks to me like the game runs best when the players are tossing around their Themes and racking up Complications. Everything speeds up dramatically. But check out the conflict of interest: Since the way to get stronger Themes is to have lower stats, and your stats stake out your cool-ass sci fi narrative possibilities, basically the game runs the most efficiently when you\u2019re the least sci-fi.<br/><br/>You can also do straight comparative rolls as well, but then you\u2019re bypassing the entire Reserve system. It might be worth it.<br/><br/>And finally, you CAN have an unopposed roll versus a set target number. However, there is scant support for determining target numbers in the text. I pulled a number out of my ass \u2013 60, based on a slightly-above-average stat x the best possible roll \u2013 as a good go-to number that would hopefully prompt most players to spend a little Reserve to win.<br/><br/>That said, I liked how Themes and Complications worked. Big fun. <br/><br/>I also liked how, despite my initial reservations, Transhuman thematic stuff did bubble to the surface. I think GM-ing toward those themes was a big part of it; there\u2019s nothing systematic that pushes those themes to the foreground. The only place where the system kind of frames up Transhuman themes (what does it mean to be human? What is my identity? How important is privacy? Etc.) is in the Core Values that are front-loaded via the Civilizations and Societies. Colin did a really nice job picking good CVs, and then framing them well within the setting\u2019s details (i.e. the Stored \u2013 digital humans \u2013 have \u201cLife\u201d as a CV, but it\u2019s not about staying alive, it\u2019s about being recognized as a life form and not a program. There are lots of details like that throughout the canon setting). <br/><br/>I did not feel like Core Values drove play that much. It\u2019s on the players to bring that to the foreground. There\u2019s no direct reward for pursing your Core Values, other than getting a +1 or +2 to you roll. You can get an identical bonus, or more, from spending your Reserve. <br/><br/>Arbitrarily hiding and then revealing bits of the Story Triggers worked pretty well, I think. The players saw the two fully revealed Triggers and, sure enough, played toward their Reveal conditions. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that, since the divide between player knowledge and character advocacy is extremely blurry in the game. On the one hand, I liked that the players kind of went along with what I sketched out. On the other hand, they didn\u2019t always have a strong fictional justification for doing so. It felt a bit strained, like the player had to rationalize why his character was trying to fulfill a Reveal, rather than play arising organically. But that\u2019s probably just how this sort of system is gonna play out.<br/><br/>There isn\u2019t any good advice in the book on revealing Elements in play, so I winged it. Whenever a player kind of aimed toward some aspect of a mostly-hidden Story Trigger, I\u2019d reveal another bit to the players. I felt a little like I was metering out bits of bait to get them to bite. It didn\u2019t look like anything in the fiction; purely a player-behavior game.<br/><br/>I had ONE player rack up a couple Complications at the end of the session just so he could buy a rank 5 Effect toward a Trigger. His character, a Spacer, is within the last decade of his life span. He\u2019s also a Sleeper, which gives him a Core Value called \u201cLongevity.\u201d So, driven purely by the fiction of his character, he staked out an Effect: \u201cThe Sleepers will acquire rank 10 Biotech.\u201d Neat! No idea how to get there yet but it\u2019s on the table, waiting to get built out.<br/><br/><b>Bottom Line</b><br/>Love the setting and the little fictional details we were able to extrapolate from the technological baselines described. If you know the setting (the civilizations, the societies, and what is possible technologically), and you pay close attention to the Core Values (both as players and GMs), a good bit of Transhumanity-themed play will arise.<br/><br/>Intrigued by the Story Trigger system, but I have to learn how to put it to better use. Needs work and a LOT more guidance text. That said, the players seemed to enjoy the upcoming-storyline-hide-and-seek game I played with them.<br/><br/>Absolutely hate the extended conflict system. Currently trying to hack out something much faster, and which will generate relevant fiction -- or at least stop motivating me to skip the fiction part just to drill through the core of rolling dice, multiplying, spending Reserve, and applying damage.<br/><br/>Love the Theme/Complication system, but concerned that it creates a bad conflict of interest (i.e. the more you invest in using it, the less Transhuman-y stuff you have narrative access to).<br/><br/>Assuming we can come up with a suitable replacement for the extended conflict system, we\u2019ll hit it again at least once or twice more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228477/#Comment_228477" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:22:38+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can also doodle up some actual play notes if anyone gives a shit.

I really appreciate it. Let me address a few items one-by-one:<br/><br/>I think you're right that the transhuman stuff isn't built into the game mechanics. It's more in the setting. I think of SA as a game that doesn't necessarily push the players  to think about transhuman issues (depending on what the GM sets up), but where the civilizations they run into definitely have thought about them and reacted in different ways.<br/><br/>Story Triggers are something that got added late in the development process and got very little playtesting. I'm glad for the data points from your experience; hopefully I can turn that into some more useful advice in an updated edition. Their execution by the players should definitely <i>not</i> look like anything in fiction, but their <i>results</i> and their <i>impacts</i> should. They're an explicitly metagame item.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time I've heard people complain about the long conflicts. I'll have to look into a way of shortening them and making them more flavorful. Neither of those were a problem in my playtests, so I need to figure out where the difficulty comes from. Out of curiosity, what games do you think really do a good job of making the conflicts (and dice-rolling) feel like a part of the setting?<br/><br/>Part of the reason the technology was listed the way it was is because SA was intended from day one to be <i>hard</i> science fiction. Make-it-up-as-you-go science fiction is typically not. Much of the tech can also be considered setting info - the stuff exists, and people use it, often as a basis for their lives.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for the detailed review. It really helps me make the game better. If you do use it again, please post some more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228516/#Comment_228516" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T17:37:24+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  5:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The extended conflict thing...yeah. I think it would have grated less if I were just, you know, faster at multiplying. It's just a lot of comparative math for every transaction:<br/><br/>1) Multiply two pairs of numbers. Take the highest one.<br/>2) Add conditional bonuses: Is a Core Value involved? Is it worth more than 5? What about this conflict's specific list of modifiers? (NB you'll probably do the grand total once, and then add *that* number every time, but you're definitely adding every time).<br/>3) Compare your highest value to the other guy's highest value. Is it a multiple? Because you have to know that to figure the damage done.<br/>4) Is someone helping? Because now you also have to divide -- is their best number equal to at least half of your best number? And if it is...they give you +1. Meh. You could have gotten that out of a single Reserve, or a Core Value.<br/>5) And then decide if you're going to spend Reserve on the roll. Which, yeah, adds multiples to your best number.<br/><br/>If it's round numbers, it's less of a big deal. It's when I've got a 47 and he's got a 19. Um...okay, I've more than doubled it but wait, is it a triple? No. Okay. Now you're helping and you rolled a 21. Oh rats, not quite half. Is it worth spending a Reserve? Wait, what's half of 47...23, no wait, 24. So you need 3 more. Okay good! My stat is 7 so yeah, that'll push me over the 50% mark. And so on and so on. Lots of handling time for a single roll. Now multiply (!) that times 5 to 10 iterations, if you're averaging 2 damage per roll and you're dealing with no less than 10 Reserve for any given conflict (probably a LOT more, given my guys all had 7-10s in their stats and 6-8, sometimes 10s, in the professions).<br/><br/>(Yes, I know I produced two unrollable -- prime -- numbers for that example. I'm being slightly unfair for the purpose of illustration.)<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Extended conflicts I think result in good and relevant ongoing fiction:<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is a high water mark for this. I assume you know how it works. <br/><br/>BW: Duel of Wits is another best-in-class. It's also notable for beating on the other guy's "hit points for the conflict", similar to hitting on Reserve. Also BE's Firefight! And of course the conflict system's final iteration in Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Conflict scenes in With Great Power build on themselves nicely over many rounds. You really have to take prior events into account when narrating each frame. The very economy is built around what you do with the specific moment of conflict within the larger fight.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century builds nicely entirely because of Aspects, but even it misguessed the length of an actual fight -- it works much better with the "go straight to consequences" method, rather than the ablative damage track you have to burn through before you ever get to consequences, RAW.<br/><br/>I think Agon is a very fun tactical game once you're into a fight. However, those tactics don't necessarily look like much in the fiction. But it's still engaging because there are interesting decisions to make along the way: Do I cash in a favor and make that guy get out of my way? Do I close in or do I push everyone else away? Which weapon do I use? Do I offer to help someone and extract a favor for later? Which target do I hit?<br/><br/>That's all just off the top of my head.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>I think the deal with SA's extended conflict system is that there aren't any meaningful decisions (either tactical or narrative) to make once you're in it. It's a pure math game, right? I can see two decisions you can make once it's begun: one, <i>Do I Escape</i>? and two, <i>Do I Start Another Conflict Inside This One</i>? The first one is just there to shut down the fight, and the second one is just there to extend the fight. But they're not adding any new context to the overall narrative shape of the conflict. Oh, and maybe a third: Do I Use My Theme? But IMO that decision typically happens before the fight even starts.<br/><br/>I think I saw in passing some rules you were using for diceless SA -- maybe on your personal campaign wiki? Are those worth looking into?<br/><br/>I hope my players drop in to talk about their experience as well, because we'd all agree we had a good time with it.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aik" title="Aik"><img alt="Aik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aik">Aik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228518/#Comment_228518" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T17:51:09+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  5:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give some more detail on how story triggers worked in play? Our group took one look at them and went; 'What's the point?' They seem to make sense at least up until the outcome stage - but why would you want to have the outcome of something set up before playing through it? In general, we didn't see what they'd actually added. For the most part what drives our game forward is complications and use of CVs and themes as flags.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to disagree a bit with your take on extended conflicts. We've settled into a rhythm with them and they work really really well (although diving straight into one after another is exhausting). At first we were very much 'let's just roll the dice now all at once and be done with it!', but ... hmm, I'm not sure how to explain the change. The fiction is very much influenced by the dice roll that preceeded it. I was trying to convince my character's father-figure/mentor to forgive her - each roll changed the flow of the conversation, influenced how the argument played out. There was furious spending of reserve when I wanted a point to stick, or the GM would spend heavily when the mentor-NPC was getting worked up and wanted to put more pressure on my character. It worked really well - a very natural back and forth flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one conflict where an NPC was trying to convince my character that her actions are evil (she has a 'don't be evil' core value). Throughout the entire conflict - although it was basically self defeating to do so - I spent reserve like crazy to have none of his points stick because I felt that she believed in what she was doing enough that she wouldn't be shaken by his arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think the key there is to have the outcome of each individual roll have some real effect in the fiction. I don't think the rules actually come out and say that - but without it then yeah, it's just rolling the dice backwards and forwards until someone runs dry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one problem with the extended conflict system I have is that if you change your approach to the conflict then all your earlier work goes for nothing. You have to just go after one of the enemy's reserve pools or you're shooting yourself in the foot. Changing from convincing them to trying to blow them to pieces is a horrible idea - especially if they're still trying to talk you down and your metatech reserve is low.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228520/#Comment_228520" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T18:29:39+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  6:29PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 8:24PM by Colin_Fredericks.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, there are some times when switching conflicts is an exceptionally good idea - if you're much better at a lower timescale conflict, you can just beat the tar out of someone with that and ignore the longer-scale conflict. Taking the four points of Reserve back is an <i>option</i>, not a requirement. You can still just take a normal victory condition. The classic example is "Hulk think puny man talk too much! Hulk Smash!" but you can also say, "Screw this Cold War stuff. Peace is the answer," and run a political campaign to end it.<br><br>Edit: The typical reason not to do this is social pressure.

Aik reminds me of a very good tactical reason to get into a (carefully chosen) nested conflict: The reserve hit on THAT fight. Yes...hm. That's actually a rilly good reason to get into it -- if your big fight is Metatech + Politics, and you get into a minifight that's Metatech + ... Courtesan or something, you're gonna drain off the other guy's Metatech to win the fight. And then when you get back into the big-scale fight, he's already that much further down. <br><br>I like that, but I think I fear paralysis-by-analysis: it seems mathematically solveable to figure out whether it's worth starting the minifight.

Since we didn't have any guidance on that, the "safe" answer was to assume the +reserve bonus at the end was the reward (although now I'm also seeing that clever minifights that chew at some of the big fight's reserve are another reward).<br/><br/>Thanks man! And don't take what you may read as my snarky internet persona seriously. I love -- love -- working with designers with an actual interest in improving their game.<br/><br/>Brainstorm for the next fight: create a little fight worksheet that is, basically a breakout sheet of what stats you're rolling, what your for-the-duration-of-the-fight modifiers are, what the reserves of each ability are, and big boxes to hold chits of the reserve. Then pull chits out of their matching boxes so you can eyeball the course of the fight. I think we forgot about the increased difficulty of rolling against abilities that are reserve-empty, so that'd help. Maybe a clever sheet design could also accommodate nested fights.

I was intrigued by the rules but wanted to see how players would actually react to them in play. So I built a couple that I intended to fully reveal to the players, and a couple where I doled out details as play progressed. Here they are for reference; the asterisk indicates the Element that started revealed to the players:<br/><br/>Main storyline trigger (generated by results of the briefing/situation generator):<br/><br/>Secret (2): An ancient alien artifact is about to be revealed. When it is, the side that owns it will use it as a seed technology for massive Cognitech advances.<br/><br/>Reveal (3): Speak with both Mechanican and Stored leaders on Zeta 19; infiltrate the Sleepers on Zeta 19; be caught in the crossfire of a fight over the seed tech; visit Zeta 20<br/><br/>Lever (2): Seed tech passes into the hands of the Mechanicans<br/><br/>Effect (4): Mechanican civilization becomes fragmented; the seed tech will change some and leave others behind. Those changed with come into direct competition with the Stored for infosphere control.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Second "main storyline" trigger, completely out of my head but touching on a couple of the Core Values on the table:<br/><br/>Secret (4): The Replicants have gotten word of Deirdre's deal to broker the seed technology; their cognitechs have projected massive game-changing gains if they can acquire the device. The Replicants are willing to go to war for it.<br/><br/>Reveal (3): Interrogate a member of Organized Crime; any character with Replicant sympathies; a top-secret mission into Replicant space, with one member neuromeshed as a Replicant<br/><br/>Lever (4): An infosphere attack on Zeta 19's wormhole control.<br/><br/>Effect (4): The Replicants stage a massive offensive on Zeta 19 and take control of its wormhole access.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Other triggers, exposed elements marked with *:<br/><br/>Secret (4): New alien computer virus will wipe out the Infosphere on Mechanican planet Zeta 19.<br/><br/>Reveal (2): Talk with exiled Stored on Zeta 20; study alien artifact (Programming or Cognitech Engineer roll); conduct a manhunt for the Mechanican explorer who discovered the device<br/><br/>* Lever (3): Digital payload is converted from Skodati dark matter storage medium and dumped into Infosphere for analysis<br/><br/>Effect (4): Massive humanitarian crisis on Zeta 19 resulting from Infosphere crash. Many analog and digital deaths as hospitals and storage media fall victim to the alien virus.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>Secret (5): Union psychohistorians have determined the best way to rid themselves of the Stardweller Armada is to change their culture. If they no longer have Diversity as a Core Value, they'll cease seeking novelty in Union space.<br/><br/>Reveal (2): Meet with Stardweller election officials; hold a political debate in the Armada; create a relationship with a Stardweller political incumbent; mesh-hack a Union spy<br/><br/>Lever (3): Armada over Zeta 19 holds elections, and incumbents are universally voted back into office.<br/><br/>* Effect (5): Stardweller political structure is undermined by Union psychohistorical meddling, converting their "Diversity" Core Value into "Aristocracy." As preferred leaders beget future generations of leaders, the Armada stops holding its Grand Convention. Eventually the Stardwellers calcify into a cultural curiosity.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>An experiment in low-rank trigger elements:<br/><br/>* Secret (1): Dorinda CLN, battle Mechanican, is a Tao media junkie a (TAO PC)'s biggest fan. She'll do anything to get close to him.<br/><br/>Reveal (2): (TAO PC) has three sexual encounters; conduct an ad campaign featuring Tao entertainment from (TAO PC's HOME PLANET); talk to Organized Crime figure trafficking in illegal (TAO PC) lenses.<br/><br/>Lever (2): Dorinda CLN is publicly rejected, and this rejection is witnessed by local celebrity media.<br/><br/>Effect (1): (TAO PC) acquires a dangerous stalker!<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>So where the players could SEE a trigger, they would normally pay attention to those story elements. That worked well. They also gave me, as GM, things to make <i>even worse</i> as a way to express Complications w/o hitting the characters in the short term.<br/><br/>What I didn't do well, which only now I recognize, is that I didn't necessarily GM toward the Reveal elements. I treated them as bait for the players, and not as handy campaign notes for me. Second sesh, I'll be using them that way. There's some murkiness in my head as to whether a Reveal or Lever can be fired off if it's still a hidden-from-the-players trigger element. I need to go through again and suss that out. Since the GM can reveal elements "at any time," it's sort of a procedural loophole for the GM to just go through a mostly-hidden Trigger, reveal everything, and then activate a Reveal or a Lever. There probably needs to be a pause between the reveal and the activation so the players can step in.<br/><br/>I'll let my players describe the impact the ST system had on their play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228728/#Comment_228728" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T12:01:38+00:00" title="August 30, 2009 12:01PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            During this first session, the major effect of story triggers seemed to have (for me, at least) was the knowledge that if I took a twist, you might use the resulting consequence to set off the lever of one of the exposed story triggers, all of which would make our supposed mission harder.

You can't convince your opponent to hear you out any more, because he pounded you into unconsciousness.<br/><br/>You can also change a specific element of the larger contest - for instance, during a war you might send in a biowarfare weapon targeted at your opponent's leadership (this works very well against a monarchy). Winning the biowar won't win you the big war, because other people will probably pick up the fight, but you might take out the most knowledgeable folks they have and thus reduce their Soldier rating. <br/><br/>I realize that these are examples rather than guidelines; let me ponder for a bit.<br/><br/>I like the sample Triggers.

So basically you can up-to-double it, and that's it. <br/><br/>* Core Value of 6+ protects you against attacks on that CV. I can't remember by how much. It's sort of hidden.<br/><br/>* There are, in fact, no real guidelines on how a nested conflict might impact a larger impact, other than abstracting it out into bonus Reserve. And, yeah, Colin, you're right -- the Reserve bonus is <i>optional</i> but other than that, there's no discussion of how to treat small-scale conflict victories. A thought on that: I think the secret sauce to making it work is to pay close attention to the limitations of what are acceptable victories if you win a smaller conflict, and decide on a case-by-case basis if the larger conflict is actually STOPPED or if the Reserve bonus is all you get. Like, you might punch me in the nose during a memetic assault, but getting socked in the nose doesn't keep me from melting your brain. In fact I think it's probably safe to assume that smaller/shorter conflicts in general do not really invalidate larger/longer conflicts.<br/><br/>Anyway, my best current thinking on the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229036/#Comment_229036" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T14:37:43+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  2:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The protection provided by CV 6+ is that PCs have to spend an extra Twist to directly affect you with Themes. It's not something that PCs can take advantage of, because NPCs don't have Themes and PCs can't use them on each other without permission. Social-esque attacks against the CV directly are very unlikely to succeed because you add your CV to your Metatech when resisting, but that's a different story.<br/><br/>I need to test out the diceless rules that we're going to use for a play-by-post game and see if they might work for a diced (or diceless) tabletop game. The main advantage is that conflicts always go for three exchanges (or less). It wouldn't solve the flavor problem, but it would make things faster.<br/><br/>Note for other game designers: playtesting with a sci-fi club and an engineering school results in a playtest group where everyone has long ago memorized their multiplication tables.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229065/#Comment_229065" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:57:20+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:57PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True dat!

The whole thing collapsed under its own weight. Final observations before I gently return this to the bookshelf:<br/><br/>* Too many contradictory systems all fighting one another. The worst I've already identified: the higher your cool-ass scifi stats, the weaker your themes. But themes are definitively more effective inside the fiction than stats. Another is the complication level, as it relates to your "Import": as your cool scifi stats go up, not only do your themes get weaker but your Complications ALSO get stronger. So there's a quick ramp-up in disincentives to even touch the Themes system -- and yet the Themes are mechanically more effective than everything else. Too many incompatible tensions that simply do not serve to create the desired play experience. One hack we briefly attempted with some success was to simply require that ALL Twists start at Complication Level 1, and if you want to buy more Twists to generate higher-level Theme effects, then that's when you make the decision to take a higher-level Complication. After some discussion, we felt that this would go a long way toward fixing Themes but we would also consider dramatically reducing the # of Themes you get at lower Import levels. The breakdown might end up 9/7/5/3.<br/><br/>* Another contradiction we had a real hard time reconciling was that Themes were both flags and anti-flags. That felt like way too much competition. Not only can you use a Theme to tell the GM "Hey this is interesting to me," you can turn around and use that Theme to simply resolve the thing you just told the GM was interesting. Is that a Czege Principle problem? Maybe. <br/><br/>* As much as I'm intrigued by Story Triggers, and as much as I tore them apart and put them back together again, the concept is IMO fundamentally broken. For example, the Lever -- that's the thing that, when it happens, creates the Trigger's final Effect. Well...the Lever itself can be treated either as a cause or an effect. As in, if the players go and do the Lever thing inside the fiction, well, they achieve the Effect (i.e. the lever is the cause of the effect). Yay! But the GM can also pull the Lever by cashing in a Complication. As far as I can tell, pulling the Lever via a Complication means the Lever's event has taken place (i.e. the Lever's event takes place out of the control of the characters, which in turn make the capital-E Effect <i>also </i>take place). I mean, it has to, logically speaking. Otherwise the Effect is just this arbitrary <i>thing</i> that suddenly gets introduced into the fiction. Some of this may come down to better guidance on what goes into a good Trigger and what is required to logically make it work, but I thought I had a very firm grasp of it and I still couldn't get it to do anything.<br/><br/>* Way too much focus on the interactions of various technologies but no focus at all on the impact of those technologies on the characters. At least not in a Nar/Theme/Story-Now kind of way. Which to my mind is utterly vital, since transhumanism is IMO a theme and not a setting. The characters, ultimately, felt like packages of cool shit they could do. The Core Values never actually drive play because there's no economy associated with them and no identifiable reward cycle. They just provide simple bonuses and no incentive/inducement to fulfill their narrative premise. But the Reserve system allows you to buy identitical bonuses, which in my mind cuts the legs out from under the CV system entirely.<br/><br/>* My overall mental state when running the game was that of unproductive creative exhaustion. Lots of reasons for that: No way to meaningfully hook into the Core Value system to drive play in a Flaggy kind of way, Themes made play direction change extremely quickly, poor support for improvisational play given the traditional tactical focus of the game (making the Oh Shit, Now What? element that much worse), and just too goddamned much front-loaded technical/technological stuff to learn -- none of which is particularly tied back to the characters themselves.<br/><br/>* We made a handful of changes to the Extended Conflict system and it DID seem to work better. For one, we required that every roll carry with it narration and that narration needed to be taken into account during the conflict (i.e. if you drop a building, there's now a collapsed building to deal with). Unfortunately, there are no rules for establishing narration credibility -- i.e. did you actually drop the building if you failed to hit the other guy? Or did the building in fact come down but simply not damage the target? For another, I proposed a conflict worksheet: Blank sheet of paper, draw a line down the middle. Put your Capability on one side and your Profession on the other. Get a stack of poker chips to indicate the Reserve pool on each side. Write down your various persistent modifiers for the conflict. Roll dice in your right and left hands, Agon-style, and place them into their correct columns. WRITE DOWN THE RESULT. Then start spending Reserve and making notes of the changed values. It's stupid-simple but it DID work. It also revealed many cases where it became obvious that the conflict was unwinnable by a side, but there's no easy way to just wrap up the fight -- AND no reason to continue it. In other games with Reserve-like system (Duel of Wits, BW), the point of staying in is to earn a Compromise. No such mechanic exists in SA, so basically you just feel trapped into the procedure. I suppose we could/should have conceded the fight sooner so the losing side could preserve their Reserve. <br/><br/>Anyway, that's it for us. Hope someone finds this stuff useful. Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231773/#Comment_231773" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:40:11+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Themes were both flags and anti-flags.

Like, we added a fifth (!) guy to the game last night. He went Old Worlder, a worshiper of the Transhumanists. So he went "Deus ex Machina" in his big themes (Plot Immunity, Intrigue, Magnetism), with the rationale that "the angels" had arranged the world around him because he was blessed by them. Neat! So that's him using the Themes as flags. But then mechanically, they're antiflags as you know. I think it's the fact that you get invested in your Theme via its descriptor -- that little bit of authorship is all it takes to "own" the theme.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>As cor DVs--you think they need a reward mechanic, like BITs in BW?

You get to add your CV as a defense against Metatech attacks against them, and subtract your CV from Metatech attacks that encourage them. For everything else, it's a +1 if it touches a CV, and a +2 if it touches a CV that's ranked 5+. <br/><br/>There is no other economy in the game. No economic flow-through at all. The only way to get Reserve back is by performing specific in-fiction procedures (plug into a socket, eat special food, etc.).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>I should re-read it...

Also go with the soft fixes I propose above: fiction-first extended conflicts, start all Complications at level 1 (rather than forcing low-Import characters to also be high-Complication characters), pay super-close attention to the keywords scattered throughout the Capability and Technology sections, and go ahead and concede fights when you can see where they're going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231823/#Comment_231823" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T13:43:54+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  1:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for this detailed thread, everyone.

It is not the characters. It's not what the characters care about. As far as I can tell, the Mesh has no impact or implication on how the characters self-identify, other than to come from a broadly defined "civilization" and how that civilization has incorporated the Mesh into its identity. I think the mesh is *the* hotsauce oh-wow technology of the game, but I have no sense -- as GM or player -- of what to DO with it to get at the themes you want gameplay to hit. You have this great little sidebar in the book somewhere (edit: MOTIFS IN S.A., page 164) about the themes you want to hit. Great! So how do you tie the concept of the Mesh into that sidebar?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>I think that some of your comments come down to me needing to explain better what different parts of the game are for.

I can see how they emerged in play, and agree that they don't function that way. But I'm not satisfied with that! I think it's because CVs are one of just two ways we can meaningfully describe what the character cares about (Themes being the other, but let's talk about that next). So we pick a CV or two or, sometimes, THREE, but they're just there for anti-meshhacking/anti-metatech defensive reasons? That means they're effectively useless except during metatech scenes and meshhacking scenes.<br/><br/>I think it'd be very interesting to move Reserve completely out of the game fiction -- i.e. "plug into a wall socket or get hit by lightning to recharge your Stringtech" -- and turn that into your game economy. Right now there is no economic flow in SA that passes through player decisions, into character actions, into the game fiction, and then back to the player to reinforce the cycle.<br/><br/>Now Themes are the only other way we get to really be creative with our character. We're gonna have a lot of authorship inevitably tied up in what our Themes say and how and when we use them. There's another opportunity to engage the reward cycle. You MIGHT consider something like this:<br/><br/>* Player engages his Core Value and, win or lose, gets paid a Twist (level 1). It might be that you don't even RANK a Core Value. It's just a thing you care about.<br/><br/>* Player uses his Twist to engage his Themes, taking on higher Complication levels if he needs something beyond a level 1 Twist. No stacking Twists! One twist = 1 activation (to force you to consider higher Complication levels).<br/><br/>Good luck with the playtest Colin!<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
