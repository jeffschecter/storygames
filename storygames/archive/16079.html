Due to the nature of the game, this writeup contains <b>serious, balls-to-the-wall SPOILERS</b>. If you ever might want to play this, think seriously about skipping this AP as each chapter has some set events that this could ruin for you.  If I haven't scared everyone off yet, here is the game synopsis from the Dreamation brochure:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Elmer Sapp did something awful to each of you. In 1890 he disappeared out west and you're all going on a one-way journey to end him. What Sapp did to you can't be made right, but at least you can wipe that smirk off his face. That's your plan. You've got a bad feeling it's a lousy plan. Note: This is an improv heavy, player driven, collaborative storytelling game. At the end of every chapter, 1 player character will die and become a co-GM till only 1 is left. And even they might not survive!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI played the Detective.  Jim played the Monster.  Samuel played the Dude.  DeWitt played the Gunman.  John facilitated as full-time GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy AP:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Elmer Sapp.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all employees, current or former, of the Pinkerton agency.  We have no names; names are unimportant.  We are what we do. The year is 1890 and we\u2019re on the tail of Elmer Sapp.  Sapp did something unforgiveable to each of us.  And while we can\u2019t be made whole, at least we can break him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Chapter one.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe curtain rises in New Jersey, a mental hospital.  Elmer Sapp, dressed in a flowing white robe, leads a group of mental patients in some sort of therapy or worship.  The Dude, who is visiting his sister in the asylum, complains loudly to the director, \u201cI know he started out as a patient here, and now he\u2019s leading sessions?  I demand to know what\u2019s going on!\u201d  He glances back over his shoulder as his sister begins to sway in time to Sapp\u2019s words.  An almost unintelligible murmur flows from the group, \u201cOne door opens and another closes.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThree months later, the Pinkertons raid the asylum.  Everyone, staff and patients, have taken their own life. The entire hospital is in disarray. The Dude rushes up to his sister\u2019s room.  Every bed in the room is made, every surface cleaned.  Her body is never found.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe present day, 1890, a town in the Lakota territory of North Dakota.  The Dude, the Monster and the Gunman have received a tip that Sapp has been or may be here.  As they ride into town they notice a priest hurriedly carrying buckets of something into the church.  Every window in the church has been covered.  The Pinkertons are suspicious and dismount to investigate.  While the Dude distracts the flustered priest, the Monster and the Gunman circle around the back of the church.  The rear door is locked, but provides no resistance to the Monster\u2019s terrifyingly gentle touch.  The stench is immediate.  Huge mounds, pillars really, of what can only be excrement rise from the floor of the church.  The Dude and the priest hear the commotion and rush in through the front door.  As the Monster pulls a skull and part of its spine from one of the pillars, the Dude pulls his pistol on the priest.  The priest puts his hands up and we see that he only has one.  The Dude forces the priest out the front door while the Monster and the Gunman leave from the back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Monster spies a Native American dressed in Western garb who is dousing the walls of the church with gasoline.  He tries to engage him, but the Native American is too focused on his task, muttering to himself about freeing the world from false doctrine.  Words having failed, the Monster casually tosses a match into the pool of gasoline.  A screaming Native American engulfed in flames runs out onto the main street of town, trying desperately to find the horse trough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe priest, seeing the flames licking at his church, rushes back through the front door to save his belongings.  The Dude follows him and gets his finger stuck in the closing church door.  The Gunman frees him from a distance as only a marksman could.  The Monster cauterizes the wound with a knife heated in the fire of a burning church.  The Gunman holsters his iron, mounts his horse and chases the priest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the burning Native American has extinguished himself in the horse trough.  But the Monster won\u2019t let him out of it.  Instead, he waterboards him while interrogating him about Sapp.  The Monster smiles while the Native American lies frantically and futilely as his head is doused again and again.  He may have died; it\u2019s not important.  What is important is that while the Monster performs his horrible work, Elmer Sapp trots out of town behind him, unnoticed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gunman rides down the priest, who offers a half-hearted explanation for his motives.  The Gunman examines the priest\u2019s belongings and notices almost painfully careful writing in the margins of his bible.  It\u2019s a paean to some person, creature or god called Massapoag.  When asked about Sapp, the priest drops everything in the mud and takes off at a dead run.  The Gunman shoots him in the leg, hoping to interrogate him.  The priest does not crawl away.  As the Gunman approaches, the priest reaches into his vestments, grabs a handful of powder and flings it at him.  The Gunman bursts into flame and is heard from no more.  As the walls of the church crumble in their own blaze, we see the pillars of feces are in fact a set of seven seven-foot-tall phalluses - Sapp\u2019s terrible calling card.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366461/#Comment_366461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T18:23:46+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  6:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Chapter two.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is 1889.  We see two men sitting in a cluttered law office.  One, by his bearing, is clearly a man of composure and self-discipline.  He is the Detective.  He is here to help the lawyer consummate his purchase of a rare tome, Liber Juratus, from one Elmer Sapp.  An unopened letter lies on the desk between them.  It has been addressed by Sapp to the lawyer.  After reading his correspondence, the lawyer notices that the envelope is not empty.  A daguerreotype, folded in two, falls from the packet along with another piece of paper.  The Detective unfolds the daguerreotype; it is of his fianc\xe9e \u2013 ex- fianc\xe9e \u2013 who ran off three months ago.  There is a man standing next to her.  The other piece of paper holds the scent of a once intimate odor, spring flowers with a hint of cinnamon; it is an invitation to a wedding.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne month later the Detective arrives at a grand hotel in upstate New York to watch his fianc\xe9e wed another man.  The scene is set, but the actors are absent.  All is still, except for ripples on the water.  An ornate white dress floats in the lake.  Beneath it, on the lake floor, are the chained bodies of the wedding party guests - all except for the body of the one who should have been wearing the dress, should have been wearing it for the Detective.  Her body is never found.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe present day, one year later, in Soda Springs, Idaho.  The Detective has been called to consult on a most unusual case.  A man has been found in the basement of the town\u2019s tavern.  The floor is tacky with mud, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be mixed only with water.  Although there are no trees outside the tavern, roots cover every inch of the cellar walls.  Caught up among them, as if crucified, is the body of Elmer Sapp.  The Detective approaches and checks for breath and pulse; neither are present.  The Monster carefully cuts off each button of Sapp\u2019s shirt with one of his many razors.  The chest is still.  The Detective removes a scalpel from his satchel and rams it into the place where Sapp\u2019s heart should be, so deep that his hand begins to sink beneath the skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nA doctor is called for the autopsy and he arrives suspiciously soon.  The Dude interrogates him about his preternaturally quick arrival.  A stick of dynamite drops from the doctor\u2019s coat.  He is searched and a letter is discovered bearing Elmer Sapp\u2019s signature.  It commands the doctor to destroy the place of Sapp\u2019s death.  Several loud bangs are heard from upstairs.  The Dude and the Detective rush to investigate, leaving the Monster alone with the doctor to extract more information.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpstairs a gun battle rages.  Pinkerton agents fire upon shambling, quasi-human forms.  The shamblers are plodding and relentless.  Blows from heavy hands rain down upon the agents in the street, while others are dragged off to a more grisly fate.  A hidden shambler lurches up behind the Detective and the Dude with hatchet in hand.  The Detective is reminded of a previous brush with death as he barely dodges the shambler\u2019s blow.  The Dude recognizes the downturned face of the shambler: this was one of his sister\u2019s ward mates.  He grabs her by the lapels and screams, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d over and over, slamming his quarry against the wall so violently that he tears her sodden corpse apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nDownstairs, the Monster has pinned the doctor to the ground and drawn his razor.  He leans down close to the doctor\u2019s face while the pinned man begs for death.  He knows what Sapp does to those who have failed him and even the Monster\u2019s ministrations are preferable to it.  The Monster lifts his razor to the doctor\u2019s head and begins to shave his scalp in slow, careful strokes, all the while whispering his questions.  Who told you to come here?  Why did Sapp want this place blown up?  The doctor is transfixed by the calmness in the Monster\u2019s slate gray eyes and can only sputter, \u201cDon\u2019t look under the floorboards.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else was the Monster to do?  He grabs a pickaxe and swings it down just inches from the doctor\u2019s head.  One swift motion tears both board and nails loose and exposes an inky blackness beneath the floor.  \u201cSo what\u2019s down there, doc?\u201d he asks.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a good look?\u201d  He grabs the doctor by the collar and forces his face into the hole.  The doctor kicks and writhes, but the long, thin fingers of the Monster\u2019s hands do not relax their grip until the doctor is still.  His faceless body is tossed aside as the Monster looks down into the Stygian depths and sees a pair of eyes looking back up.  In a burst of motion, he is up the stairs and out the door of the tavern.  He yells to the Detective, \u201cYou damn well better take care of this man,\u201d as he gestures towards the Dude and runs off along the blood trail the shamblers and their Pinkerton prey have left.  The last we see of the Monster is as he climbs the back of a man-thing and stabs, stabs, stabs\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366462/#Comment_366462" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T18:24:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  6:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Chapter three.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTen years ago, in a hot and humid courtroom, the murder trial of Elmer Sapp had entered its final day. Sapp, arrogant as he is, has chosen to represent himself.  Despite the heavy weight of evidence against him, the mood in the room is tense; it\u2019s no simple thing to hang a crime on Elmer Sapp.  So when Sapp declares he has a surprise witness to call it is pandemonium in the court.  When that witness is announced as Elmer Sapp, Jr. things only get worse.  A teenage boy with long, thin fingers and slate gray eyes takes the stand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cNow boy, you\u2019re safe here, boy.  You can tell the truth.  When we picked you up, you gave a statement as to who committed those murders.  Now you\u2019re saying that statement ain\u2019t true.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy is shy, terribly so.  He stutters and twists his hands helplessly.  He tries to tell the prosecutor that his daddy didn\u2019t kill nobody.  It couldn\u2019t have been him. It just couldn\u2019t have been, he wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, sir.  Behind him, Elmer Sapp crosses his arms and smiles that half smile of his, that one that one that would make anyone want to kill him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy goes on and his shyness disappears.  He becomes bold on the stand, defiant.  No sir, my daddy didn\u2019t commit those murders; I did.  That woman, why you should have heard how she cursed.  She had a mouth like a two dollar whore, sir.  So I done it, I cut her tongue out and I done it.  She had it coming, sir, she truly did.  That bitch had it coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBehind the boy, Sapp\u2019s smile goes from halfcocked to shit eating.  No sir, it\u2019s no simple thing to hang a crime on Elmer Sapp, no simple thing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTen years later, the present day, 1890, in Crawford, Nebraska.  The Detective and the Dude have received word that people in the town and the adjacent railroad camps have been going missing, bodies disappearing without a trace.  Neither the Detective nor the Dude can pretend this is something they have not experienced.  A coolie boy lies on a pallet by the half-finished tracks, his mind fever-mad and his mouth unable to be stilled.  The camp boss, a hulk of a man with an Irish surname, pours whiskey down the boy\u2019s throat to calm him.  Through the sprawl of frantic Mandarin, the Pinkertons recognize one word.  Sapp.  Sapp has been here, and so have the shamblers.  The leavings of their victims show a trail into the darkness of the half-finished tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Detective and the Dude exchange a look, grab torches and head into the tunnel.  They are met with the cloying sweet smell of fruit left to rot, mixed with what seems to be a hint of perfume\u2026 perhaps mixed with cinnamon?  A hot, dead breeze blows toward the tunnel entrance.  Pockets of gas make the torches pop and flare.  The walls and ceiling are covered with a dense network of roots.  They seem to almost pulse with life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAhead the tracks stop and a handcar sits, disused.  Lying broken on the pivot arm is the body of a German Sheppard.  The Pinkertons approach warily from the back; why is this here? From the front, the meaning is all too clear.  Stitched crudely to the dog\u2019s skull is the face of the Monster, the look of terror still apparent on his face.  The two men press on, following the sound of music.  To one it sounds like his sister\u2019s favorite song; to the other, it is the song his fianc\xe9e was to walk down the aisle to.  The character of the tunnel changes, from machine crafted to hand hewn; the roots weave tighter on the walls, ceiling and now the floor.  They squish wetly when stepped on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilhouettes are spotted in the distance.  Three figures, but of what?  And are they approaching or retreating?  The Detective tosses his torch forward to shed light on the situation.  A gas pocket ignites and the figures are given terrible illumination: three shamblers, two dreadfully familiar and all three now engulfed in flame.  What was once the Gunman brings the butt of his rifle down upon the Dude, over and over, while the Detective dodges the flaming husk of one of his fianc\xe9e\u2019s bridesmaids.  The bridesmaid falls writhing to the root-covered floor.  The Detective sees his opening and rushes down deeper into the cavern, pausing only long enough to pick up his discarded torch; he is sprinting past the bridesmaid, sprinting past the third shambler, sprinting past the Gunman dragging the struggling Dude deeper into the pit.  His cries for help echo incessantly in the close, confined space of the cavern.  The Detective hears only a bridal march.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, there is Sapp.  He is again as if crucified by the vines that enwrap his arms and legs.  They pulse with life.  Are they stealing his or giving him theirs?  Is there a difference between the two? Behind him the roots writhe and a low, wet sucking noise sounds sporadically.   The Detective rushes forward, bent on vengeance and slips down into an unseen pit.  As he falls, the last thing he sees is the Gunman tossing the Dude into the void behind Sapp, as if he were a stoker feeding the fire.  The sucking gets louder, and now it is both in front of and below the Detective.  But he is not to be stopped so easily.  His hands grip tight to the vines and they become as ropes to him as he lifts himself from the trap.  There, on the ground.  What is that?  A stick of dynamite.  It must have fallen from the Dude\u2019s coat.  The Detective\u2019s eyes glint in the torchlight as he makes a wild grab for the dynamite.  Fire meets fuse and the last living Pinkerton rushes towards Sapp with explosive in hand.  Yards become feet become inches as the fuse burns down, down, down\u2026 to the sodden base and is extinguished.  The scene goes black.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366463/#Comment_366463" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T18:24:40+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  6:24PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Chapter four.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTwenty-five years ago, a tent revival in West Virginia.  The congregation is led by Elmer Sapp.  He proclaims mightily in front of the assembled masses as they writhe and quiver with his words.  Women are running naked through the hills; men are leaping through fires.  Everywhere there is motion.  Sapp steps down from the stage and a single father rushes his young son forward.  He pushes the boy in front of him, maybe like herding cattle or maybe like holding up a trophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThis here is Elmer Sapp, boy.  He\u2019s the reason everybody\u2019s here and he\u2019s gonna make you a man.\u201d  Sapp smiles benevolently down upon the boy.  The father almost blushes.  He tousles his son\u2019s hair and says almost as an afterthought, \u201cOf course, you\u2019re gonna need this,\u201d and he pulls out a rifle that once belonged to the boy\u2019s grandfather.  \u201cShe shoots straight and true, son, and Mr. Sapp is gonna show you how to use her.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nA week later and Sapp and the boy stand at a practice range.  Five targets are separated from each other by a number of overfilled sacks.  The boy has made excellent progress.  He takes steady aim at one of the targets as his instructor\u2019s voice rises.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cShooting at targets is one thing boy, but can you make the shot when it counts?  When the stakes are high?  When there\u2019s pressure?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the final word, Sapp jerks his knife toward the boy\u2019s face as he pulls the trigger.  His hand shakes, the barrel moves and the shot veers off target to the right, lodging itself into one of the sacks with a wet, heavy thump.  A muffled scream is heard and the boy becomes an orphan.  He will never miss a shot again.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevils Tower, New Mexico, 1890.  The imposing mesa looms high above two lone figures.   One leads and one follows.  The first hesitates and turns back to the second.  \u201cMister, I\u2019m scared,\u201d he says, \u201cI heard of this guy Sapp and I heard what he done to people.  I heard he done awful, awful things, mister.\u201d  The second figure stares into the eyes of the first.  \u201cSon, you can take me to the top of this rock and Elmer Sapp might do something horrible to you, or you can stay down here and I guarantee that I\u2019ll do something horrible to you.  Now, walk.\u201d  The Detective fastens his thick, fur coat against the coldness of winter in the high plains.  His hands are free as he has left his investigation bag behind.  The Navajo boy turns and walks forward on shaking legs.  The trail curves in and out between the rock\u2019s outcroppings.  A fine sprinkling of snow falls.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of the corner of his eye, the Detective notices motion.  A tendril of vine is descending from above.  In its prehensile grasp is a body, held by the neck as if hanged.  The Detective doesn\u2019t even bother to check the face; could it possibly be someone he doesn\u2019t know?  That\u2019s not Sapp\u2019s way.  Another body descends, but this one has life to it still. The Detective raises his pistol and aims for the vine just above where it clears the head.  He pulls the trigger and the gun explodes into pieces, as does the Detective\u2019s hand.  He looks down at the bloody mess and then up at his young guide.  \u201cWalk,\u201d he says.  The boy does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trail ends, but the Detective knows this is not the end of the trip.  He has a handwritten invitation in his pocket signed by Elmer Sapp.  No, there is to be passage to the top.  A rope ladder uncoils down from a higher level.  The Detective tells the boy to climb up first and he follows second, with difficulty.  At the top awaits\u2026 someone.  Something?  He is obese, with his yellowed flesh pouring out of his Mexican army uniform.  One of his eyes is covered with a patch and the other stares dully ahead.  \u201c\xa1Hola, amigo!\u201d he roars.  \u201cWe have been expecting you.\u201d  The Detective replies in near perfect Spanish, \u201cI seek Sapp.  I have come to find Sapp.\u201d  \u201cOf course you have, and you shall!\u201d bellows the man-thing, \u201cBut first, I must ask you a question.  It is a simple question, hombre:  do you fear death?\u201d The Detective doesn\u2019t hesitate to answer in the negative.  The colonel draws him close, almost in an embrace and lifts up his eye patch.  A cold, piercing eye stares out from a socket that is not its own.  The words the colonel speaks in reply are neither English, nor Spanish, nor of any human tongue.  The Detective steps back and hollers in jest, \u201cYou\u2019re alright, colonel! I don\u2019t care what they say, you\u2019re alright!\u201d and pounds him hard on the back with his mangled hand.  Blood splatters on the creature\u2019s already filthy uniform.  The colonel guffaws and seems to lose himself momentarily.  The Detective walks past and the guide steps forward.  \u201cYou, however, cannot go on,\u201d the colonel says as he empties a scattergun into the belly of the guide.  The Detective does not look back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAhead of him rises the mesa and towering above it, a tree.  This, this is the source of all the roots.  The genesis, the alpha, and now the omega.  For this is where Sapp must be.  And as if on cue, he is.  He says words, but they are meaningless.  Empty air filling a hollow space.  Only one thing matters now and both Sapp and the Detective must know it.  Sapp turns and walks toward the base of the tree.  His hair parts and there she is, there she is on the back of Sapp\u2019s head: the fianc\xe9e.  She calls to the Detective, whispers to him, pleads with him.  She never wanted any other, only him, forever him.  He is her only thing and everything.  He rushes toward her and embraces her tightly with his ruined hand.  The faces on both sides of Sapp\u2019s head are smiling.  His other hand reaches covertly into his thick coat and strikes a match to touch to the fuses of the dynamite lining its inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo late, Sapp realizes what has happened.  He struggles, but the Detective has clamped on tightly.  He is not to be shaken.  And worse, far worse for Sapp, is that the roots have encircled the triad and are pulling them into the trunk of the tree.  Even as the fuses burn down, they are being drawn into the heart of the plant, the very center of the being.  And as the bark closes around them, the fuses hit bottom and what sounds like a kernel of corn popping in our world sounds like the very end of the other one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>End.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366467/#Comment_366467" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T18:37:51+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  6:37PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This writeup is epic!

We had 2 alternates and some of the people signed up didn't realize it was a Jason Morningstar game but were hooked in by the "western horror", "pinkertons", "PCs die at the end of every chapter", and "1 PC will be left" parts.<br><br>We sat down after the game and debriefed. <br><br>Players liked the structure and no one minded playing the Adversary or losing their Pinkerton. Although in previous playtests we had several players who had never GMed before and were nervous and said they didn't want to play the Adversary but then they did it anyway without any pressure, even after we said they didn't have to.<br><br>I couldn't use most of my GMing techniques in this game so I focused primarily on spotlight management for both players and GMs. I tried to facilitate a tagging in and out GM technique early on and it mostly worked well. I would start describing something as a GM, leave a big blank or ask a question and then tag in another GM to fill in the rest. There were times this was awkward but overall we kept tagging in and out fluidly. This game was very successful GM wise where previous games had GMs talking over each other, one upping, and brainstorming instead of playing. <br><br>There were a few terms we didn't know, like "popinjay".<br><br>We were sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of information on the cards. "Do we have to use all of this?"<br><br>We had problems with Chapter Two's Flashback. It turned out fine but there was a few minutes of "we have no idea."<br><br>We loved that the Flashback cards said how long ago they were.<br><br>It seemed as if Location cards were barely used given how many details the Chapter Card had.<br><br>The Chapter Card 2 card was shocking!<br><br>Overall I think some of us were surprised how colorful and horrific these cards were!<br><br>Each group I've played with wanted a random mechanic for determining who died at the end of a chapter if it wasn't clearly obvious. Someone proposed drawing a card and whomever drew lowest died. <br><br>There was some frustration towards the end when there were 2 to 3+ Adversaries sharing the same Chapter and Location cards. "Do we read this out loud?" "Do we go into another room to plan?" "How do we organize all this?" "Who says what?" "Do we need to all read these cards?" That said, most of these frustrations faded after 5 or less minutes and people generally had little problem co-GMing. <br><br>Everyone really liked the letter (which was actual printed letter handout) to the Pinkertons.<br><br>One or two players wanted the chapters to have a specific time limit. We put a stop watch on the table and limited the chapters to 30 minutes. Although there was at least 1 scene where some of the players wanted the Chapter to be longer. <br><br>Everyone liked the card contents but several players disliked the color and patterns on the card backs as they felt they didn't capture the tone of the game. <br><br>The game was much more immersive than I thought it could be. I wasn't even playing a character and I was immersed and horrified.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366538/#Comment_366538" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T08:20:58+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  8:20AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to say this sounds amazingly creepy, I love western horror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366548/#Comment_366548" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T09:37:03+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  9:37AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 5:54PM by jenskot.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>But while Elmer Sapp has a tight system for situation, characters, chapters, flashbacks, GM authority, and other details it is agnostic when it comes to mechanical resolution.
