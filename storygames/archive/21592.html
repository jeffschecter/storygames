HoS is GMless game about power, scheming, and courtley intrigue, (think Game of Thrones), which gives rewards based on roleplaying; I discuss how it does so in detail below. <br/><br/>One thing that GMless games can often suffer from is story sprawl, people all have different ideas about the direction the story should take and don\u2019t build enough on other players\u2019 contributes to the story. HoS gives players an narrative reward (in terms of narrative authority) for building on another player\u2019s contribution to the story: this helps to keep the story threads related and relevant to one another, helps to keep a constant tone, and to produce a better story. The mechanic furthers the aims of the game\u2019s design in tangible and well thought out ways, as opposed to Inspiration which is somewhat shallow in design\u2014I\u2019ll discuss this in more detail below.<br/><br/>In HoS, the reward for building on someone\u2019s  contribution to the story is not as arbitrary as a bonus; instead, the reward is orthogonal to the core narrative resolution mechanic. Players are rewarded with an opportunity to change the narrative in a substantial way (ie more narrative authority) that simultaneously reinforces tension, optimal  narrative arc and timing, and the overall design objectives of the game. An example of a narrative reward a PC could choose from\u2014because they previously built on another player\u2019s contribution to the story in a significant way\u2014could be the ability to narrate a scene in which an NPC, who is friendly to another player, betrays that player\u2014there are other similar narrative options a player could choose as a reward, which are related to that characters nature (ie personality, ideals, and the like) and their intent/aims within the story. These mechanics are designed and timed in a way that creates the ultimate amount of dramatic tension and PC buy-in.<br/><br/>The mechanics reward players for a certain kind of role-playing because that roleplaying works towards producing the objectives of the game, they improve the story, they keep the story tightly waved and every player\u2019s contribution relevant to the others, they support the themes of the story in an emergent way, etc. In other words, they don\u2019t leave everything up to skill or an implicit or explicit social contract, which is one of the major reasons that GMless games fail, but instead work with other mechanics to create an emergent story that enacts the game\u2019s design goals, and prevents story failure. <br/><br/>Inspiration in 5e, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t really work towards the design goals of the game in any substantive or deep sense; It just says, do some cool roleplaying and you\u2019ll get a bonus that doesn\u2019t really have a relevant or and coherent narrative affect, in the game design sense. Because it\u2019s superficial, and easy (in the non-elegant sense), it feels like an add-on rather than a deeply considered design decision. It\u2019s not bad, but it is lazy, sub-optimal solution.<br/><br/>5e is an absolutely great game, and I like it that they are starting to incorporate dramatist play style options into D&amp;D, and I\u2019d prefer to have a seemingly tacked-on mechanic like Inspiration to not having any dramatist options at all. It\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction, but I can definitely understand why people think that that specific aspect of its design can be improved. Although, it\u2019s not immediately evident to me what the that improvement would look like. I would have to think about it for a while, in the context of their overall game design goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472067/#Comment_472067" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T17:49:03+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  5:49PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2018 5:54PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kenny_J,<br/><br/>I'd start by looking at <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, as well as all the games which borrow "Key" mechanics from it (e.g. <i>Lady Blackbird</i>). Same goes for <i>Burning Wheel</i> and <i>Mouse Guard</i>, for another "branch" of the tree which I feel "inspired" 5e's Inspiration. <br/><br/>Lots of PbtA games use this kind of thing effectively, too. Consider, for starters, how "seduce/manipulate" works in <i>Apocalypse World</i>, and many/most of the moves in <i>Monsterhearts</i>.<br/><br/>The way Relationship Dice work in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is also a really interesting contrast to Bonds in 5e. Similar in some respects and different in others. Notable is the common practice of assigning them *in play* as opposed to at character creation (something I've never seen done in D&amp;D; and, although it's not strictly textually clear in <i>Dogs</i> either, it is definitely common practice).<br/><br/>The Rules in <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> form an interesting example of this, too, where following or breaking them IS the whole point of each scene, and each offers interesting choices to the characters.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a mechanic I was working on for a game I wrote about 10 years ago, which you'll find has some differences and some striking similarities to D&amp;D's rules:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7877/help-me-awesom-ify-fine-tune-a-mechanic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/7877/help-me-awesom-ify-fine-tune-a-mechanic</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472068/#Comment_472068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T17:55:37+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  5:55PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a>,<br/><br/>I don't want to distract too much from this thread, but I'm really liking your example of being "rewarded" for reincorporating another player's interests by being able to create something in-genre (an NPC's betrayal).

Or is your question broader than that? <br/><br/>1) Does rewarding players with more agency have to be the result of roleplaying or could it simply be part of the narrative options that are made available to the players after rolling dice to determine the outcome of a resolution?<br/><br/>2) Does the players reward, of more agency, have to be based on modifying a dice roll or can it be triggered by a certain type of roleplaying and then result in a reward of players having more agency becuse they have narrative options/authority that they didn\u2019t have before?  In other words, without the need of a dice role or a modification of one?<br/><br/>Basically, if you have a second, can in detail exactly how similar the mechanic needs to be  to the Inspiration mechanic and especially in which ways that it needs to be similar...what the specific features and parameters of mechanic the mechanic would be? <br/><br/>I might have a bunch of suggestions if I  understand you question better.

As you mentioned, if we want to discuss <b>House Of Spiders</b> more we can do so in the HoS design thread. <br/><br/>As you know, I was running into some problems with HoS being slippery and not achieving its design goals reliablly enough in play...and you know how frustrated I was <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So I\u2019ve been breaking everything down into its component parts and systemizing it, similar to how PbtA games do this to create emergent narratives. This is solving a lot of the issues I was having. The idea of using the orthogonal mechanic  arose in a conversation with Ron Edwards, who suggested implementing specfic narrative outcomes as a reward...he liked the way it was done in <b>Steal Away Jordan</b>...but I never knew how to incorporate this mechanic in a way that made sense until I started dissecting the game into its component parts, and directing the game at this level in a more focused manner. It\u2019s going to take a ton of time to design (5 years?), but it should be very thorough and solid. I would definitely like to talk to you and David about the direction HoS is taking and what you think about it. I need to actually write about this stuff on the design thread. It might also be cool for the three of us to start designing a game together, just for kicks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, I\u2019ve learned a lot from PbtA games about how to break things down into mini \u201cinstructions\u201d and they\u2019ve helped me to see some of the ways to make the game less slippery and more intuitive, natural, and less demanding. I believe you've talked about the PbtA design fad slowing down fairly soon and  GMed RPG design (or design on a whole?) going in a different direction soon. I would very much like to hear where you think future games will go in the GMed design space. And where you would like them to go. That would be a super interesting discussion for another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472101/#Comment_472101" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T19:19:06+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  7:19PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on all of the above!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472112/#Comment_472112" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T20:15:14+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  8:15PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> <br/><br/>I was interested to hear what else was out there that works very similar to the 5e inspiration for sure (but less tacked on), but I figured I would get wider ranging stuff as well. But I'm definitely not confining my question to methods that only modify dice rolls.<br/><br/>I am broadly interested in any mechanical setup that rewards players with agency. I figure there are some mechanics out there that I currently lack the language to describe properly and maybe learn something I didn't expect to. <br/><br/>I'm was also interested in ways that agency rewards interact with other mechanics in a way many agree that 5e does not. So at the risk of making this discussion even more broad I will outline my two core questions,<br/><br/>1)What are some games that do agency as a reward (or as core objective of gameplay) well?<br/><br/>2)How are these rewards and triggers for rewards integrated into the rest of the experience?<br/><br/>Unfortunately I'm having trouble articulating what I'm after, partly because I intuitively know there are methods out there written into games but haven't had a lot of personal experience with those sorts of setups.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472114/#Comment_472114" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T20:27:07+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  8:27PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>.

In SK, PCs have 2-3 Passions, things they care about a whole lot, and if you have a high enough Passion, you <i>can't be killed</i>. ("Death cannot stop true love.") During play, if a Passion is relevant in a scene, you can invoke it once per scene for a massive bonus that will often guarantee at least momentary success. Whereas if no Passion is relevant in a scene, you can still spend the game's "Fate point" equivalents, but they're not nearly as powerful.<br/><br/>It has some holes. It's not as clear as could be how you switch points around between Passions, and how you recover the other type of points could be more closely tied to the Passions, IMO.<br/><br/>But the biggest way the Passions impact play is that they actually make social scenes more deadly than combat scenes: if the Villain can convince you that, e.g., your son has abandoned you and no longer cares about you, your Passion for your son might drop low enough that you could then be killed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472134/#Comment_472134" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T03:02:57+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  3:02AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My gold standard for this continues to be <b>Tenra Bansho Zero</b>;  The Aiki/Kiai/Karma (They're separate, but I'm not sure folks care enough for me to explain in depth) system does everything I want from a system of this sort:<br/><br/>* It's not dependent on the GM to be monitoring X players times Y special traits in order to award it.  Everyone hands out Aiki, and while it should be rewarded to people who play their Fates, it's also explicitly used as a "That was awesome, I liked it" award.<br/>* It has a great deal of power in play.  Inspiration has the potential to be a bummer, when you face the bugbear chief that burned down your village, charge into the fray, yell "For Hillsvale!" spend your inspiration, and roll a 4 and an 8.  Kiai potentially has way more impact than your character's actual stats/skills.  When you decide something matters, you get the Shonen Anime moment.<br/>* It has its own internal limiter; Karma accumulates as you spend Kiai, and too much karma is a problem, so even if you are rolling in Kiai, there are decisions on when to spend it (and how. It potentially has many uses)<br/>* It ties back around to your character's Fates;  You reduce Karma by resolving your Fates, so your character is mechanically driven to change, rather than being a 5th level fighter whose burned village is still the most important thing in his life or whatever background you picked.<br/><br/>It does have some issues though:<br/>* As a result of amount of power it adds to the game, the game is ill suited for long term play.  (This was a conscious design decision.)  So if that's what you want, you have to hack a bit - the usual method being to reset any long-term stat changes to your character between "episodes" or whatever.<br/>* It involves some bookkeeping.  You need the occasional 10 minute intermission to sort things out.<br/><br/>I probably forgot some stuff too.  But after playing with this, I feel let down by "GM gives out magic points for Things" systems (including Fate to some extent.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472166/#Comment_472166" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T19:34:10+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  7:34PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another game with uneven implementation is the Exalted "Stunt" system. there you get bonus dice for your dice pool if you describe your actions in a cool way. The advantage of this is it is a carrot approach, it is a one off that directly ties what the players do to the bonus. The problem is "cool" is poorly defined so some GMs shut this down accidentally by saying, that was an OK stunt, but it wasn't "cool" or the GM misinterprets the descriptions and applies additional rolls and difficulty to the roll.<br/><br/>A better implementation is Wushu where everything the player says happens as described, the dice are rolled to see if the target has any will left to fight. You do get better bonuses for including better and more detail though.<br/><br/><br/>PTA Fanmail is a decent implementation. As long as the game doesn't devolve to using fanmail as a pity vote.<br/><br/>I feel like they way Fate points are used could be a good implementation.
