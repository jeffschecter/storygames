In the year (almost) that the game has been out, I've discovered a lot about different ways to run and play the game, methods for encouraging quality play and so forth. In an effort to bring all of this together, I've written the Companion. It also includes information on various shadowy intelligence agencies operating in Berlin and offer a sample hidden agenda for each, something that may be useful when people are creating characters. There are also a few locations outside of Berlin, such as Krasnoyarsk-14 in Russia and Porton Down in rural England. These all tie in to events in Berlin in some way and have been illustrated with story hooks to bring them all together.<br/><br/>So in anticipation of the release in August (at Gen Con), there's a now a <a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk/zips/compprev.zip" rel="nofollow">short preview up on the Contested Ground Studios website</a>. In this, there's also an example of the fantastically disturbing artwork that Paul Bourne has produced for the book. <br/><br/>My hope is that the Companion is see as a valuable and worthwhile addition to Cold City. I certainly feel that the game has benefitted from my experience (and the experiences a feedback of others, for which I am very grateful) since it was released and the Companion attempts to distil this information and make it useful for others.<br/><br/>Any feedback/questions/random taunting gratefully received!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80807/#Comment_80807" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T06:45:24+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  6:45AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i've been wondering what this thing is.

The monster baby freaked me out when Paul first showed me it. My response was "That's awful! But awful in a really good way." Paul has done an amazing job with the art and design of the book. The chapter headings (which you don't get to see in the preview) are great in and of themselves and the full page art pieces do a wonderful job of combining photography and CG to disturbing effect. I'm also pleased that paul chose to use some of my photography as backgrounds in his art.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>Looks very spiffy.

Again, I'm glad that the pre release view you got of it has been useful to you in running your games. That's what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>The Newman-Dempsey Variation for negative traits is indeed a very good application of what always proved to be a minor quibble people had with the game. Those who pick the 3rd printing of the game up at Gen Con will probably notice that the change has been put into the main game text as well. This was really a housecleaning matter, and it still appears in the Companion for completeness sake and for those who might have a copy of the 1st or 2nd printings.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

I do hope that the topics contained in the book do prove of interest.<br/><br/>Yes, the Dossier is most certainly available in PDF, from an Indie Press Revolution near you!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Master%20of%20the%20Game" title="Master of the Game"><img alt="Master of the Game" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Master%20of%20the%20Game">Master of the Game</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81590/#Comment_81590" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T03:07:23+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  3:07AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cold City was one of the absolute best books I've read this year, and I've read a <i>lot</i> of books.

It's been very illuminating to see how the process works from the point of view of one of the individuals right in the middle of it. And your support of Cold City was also very much appreciated!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I was cleaning out my car and I found my copy of Cold City from where we played just after last year's Gen Con.
