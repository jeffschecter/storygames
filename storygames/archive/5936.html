This way, it didn't clutter up my Inbox and I could check it out when I felt like it, instead of whenever I wanted to check out other, non-list mails. And for a while, it worked well.<br/><br/>Until some critical mass was reached and I started forgetting about the various lists. Or didn't subscribe in the first place because I figured I wouldn't check it anway or whatever.<br/><br/>So now, I set up a mail account specifically as a container for mailing lists, news groups and whatnot. This way, I have the things "firewalled" from the rest of my email communication while still keeping up with what happens there.<br/><br/>So now I want to know about the various interesting Yahoo Groups and Mailing Lists there are. I just joined the GOB-POD-Printing Group and will now switch all my other Yahoo groups over to the new address (Like the Play Now! Group.), but I know there have been a couple that sounded interested and I planned to join but for some reason didn't. So I need you to tell me/recommend me those. <br/><br/>(They don't have to be strictly game-related either. Just "Stuff you think I might find interesting/cool/funny/enlightening".)<br/><br/>M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
