                    I'd like a game thing where Keys/Secrets that belonged to a PC group as a whole - ideally, this could translate into the players using their characters to invest into changing/defining their group. Does anyone think this could work? How would the rules be tweaked to facilitate this?                </div>

                            So the individuals in the group would have differing abilities (areas of competance), but hold the same motivations and special powers?<br/><br/>Hmm... I'd guess you would get unity, at the cost of conflict &amp; dynamic interplay between characters inside the group - assuming that they *only* have the group Keys!<br/><br/>Defining &amp; changing the group? So, each character can take action to change/add a Key or Secret to the group pool, which they all have as a grabby part of their character.<br/><br/>I like the idea of doing a mix of shared cultural Keys &amp; individual personal Keys - kind of puts you in mind of a tribal group caught between innovation &amp; tradition, heroism &amp; cooperation...                        </div>

                            Some things to think about:<br/><br/>The greatest thing about Keys in play, isn't only that they are a way for the player to tell the GM what is important or for the player to get their own XP, that's the obvious stuff.  What is cool is that it is a mechanical enticement to force your character to change in ways that are meaningful to the player.<br/><br/>Would there be a choice of Campaign Keys that would allow players to change the direction of the campaign?                        </div>

                            I was thinking about a mix of individual and group Keys/Secrets, hopefully without being too overwhelming. (It occurs to me that Secrets might work better than keys, since "we can kick ass in similar ways" is okay, but "we have the same flags" is probably not true.)                        </div>

                            One way in which I think Group Keys might be interesting is if someone wanted to play a dungeon-crawl-type adventure, where things like killing monsters and getting treasure are primary objectives.  Sure, characters would also get experience for their individual keys, but whenever they take out the ogre and grab his 100 cp and his wheel of cheese, everybody rings up some points.<br/><br/>Actually, I really like the idea, and I can see it being used to provide some focus to a campaign game.  Our group has a tendency to make packs of broken and outsider characters, with a focus on internal conflicts.  Letting them pick group keys could provide a collective goal (uphold the law, make money, a common enemy) and a reason to actively support one another.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, you could just have everyone take the same key to achieve the same effect...                        </div>

                            Or, Dev, you can set it up so that the PCs are exemplars of their common group, and <em>begin play</em> with common keys from that group.  As long as a majority of them have any individual key, the group has that key.  So as long as three of five characters have Key of Bloodlust, their tribe is kind of scary and intense when it comes to conflicts.  But when one of those three ditches bloodlust, for whatever personal reason, it mirrors a similar change in the larger group.  The tribe has settled down.  The two remaining characters are now the Old Guard, and are maybe looked on as relics of the past, increasingly irrelevant.<br/><br/>Similarly, when a majority of player characters pick up a new key, it is mirrored in the group they are exemplars of.  So three of the five pick up the Key of Unrequited Love (for their own, individual reasons), and their tribe also starts valuing and emphasizing love of the unreachable variety.  This can be either because the tribe is following the exemplars' example (see medieval monarchies for this sort of aping-what-the-King-likes), or because the exemplars are swept up in the same broad motions of history that the rest of their tribe is caught up in.<br/><br/>Now, the really interesting part to me is that, if the player characters ditch their common keys and don't replace them with new common keys, the group of which they are exemplars... just sort of dissolves into the background with nothing left to define them.  They used to be Bloodthirty savages who fought over their Unrequited Loves, but they settled down and lost the Bloodthirsty thing, and got over the Unrequited Love theme, and now... now there's not really anything to make them the same group.  They're likely to wander off or pledge loyalty or join the ideology of some neighboring group.  They're ripe for conquest, proselytization, and exploitation.  So the players <em>must</em> be conscious of maintaining some sort of identity, remaining true to their culture even as they try to develop the culture beyond where it started them off at.<br/><br/>...I'm going to go scribble notes in my Agora folder, now.                        </div>

                            Just for my clarification, are you thinking that when somebody hits the group key, that one character gets XP, or when somebody hits the group key, everybody gets XP?                        </div>

<p>Joshua: that's quite helpful. One different spin on that is that the collective keys are the "template" that any new group member (or random NPC) is assumed to have, and they need to advance/grow away from those keys if they wish.</p>
<p>(I was thinking I could make Keys cheaper depending on how many others have them, but that might get a bit too mathy.)</p>
