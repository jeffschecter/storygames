Burning Wheel. The system is complex, and you really need a solid understanding/knowledge of the entirity of the rules to make the game fly. It is crunchy because it is a complex system with a lot of rules, a lot of drawn-out resolution mechanics (Fight!, Range and Cover, Duel of Wits, etc). It is also fiddly in my mind, because there are a lot of boxes to tick off for experience and wounds and you have artha which are 3 different types of points and you roll pools of dice and there's a lot of "tweaking" to the character creation process. This all feels "fiddly" to me.<br/><br/>2. Don't Rest Your Head. There's a lot of different dice, and coin pools, and you roll handfuls of things at a time. You have multiple categories of checkboxes. At the same time... it's not a complex system and it doesn't ever feel like you're "slogging on". Everything is quick and resolved simply. There's just a lot of tactile and resource-tracking elements involved.<br/><br/>2b. Unistat. It's a dead simple game. There are four rules. But you pick a collection of dice, and you are always deciding what combinations of dice to roll... All of the strategy and gameplay is tactile and involves mountains of dice. It's fiddly, while still being the farthest thing from crunchy I can think of.<br/><br/>3. Unsure right now. I'll think about it.<br/><br/>4. The Pool. It's simple, straightforward, and not super tactile. There aren't a lot of pools to keep track of, nor are there a lot of complex mechanics or sub-systems. Therefore, it is non-crunchy and non-fiddly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108703/#Comment_108703" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-17T23:47:52+00:00" title="November 17, 2007 11:47PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>3.

Fiddly yes, as in lots of rules to fiddle with (life paths, duel of wits, scripting mechanics, beliefs and instintcs etc.), but not much crunch, as in number crunching. For crunchy, I think point build systems like Champions or games with lots of tables like Phoenix Command. The Riddle of Steel seems crunchier to me, but I haven't really played it. DnD 3.5 also seems crunchier to me with the skill branching and movement/attack rules and its definitely somewhat fiddly too.<br/><br/>2. DRYH is pretty good here. Some fiddle, no real crunch. I think DitV fits here nicely, some fiddly with the raising and seeing, all the attributes, traits, relationships. Not much crunch. What about Mortal Coil and Carry here too?<br/><br/>3. This one's hard. I'm thinking Phoenix Command here, but its been a long time since I saw it.<br/><br/>4. PtA goes here.

And I tend to have a strange selective blindness when it comes to experience trackers. One of my personal benchmarks for crunch is "if a calculator is helpful, the game is crunchy." <br/><br/>Oh, another Fiddly Not Crunchy game would be Full Light Full Steam.

That doesn't mean that crunchiness fits together in a way that makes sense, but with a crunchy system if you ignore any bit of the crunch the rest falls apart. For example D&amp;D grappling rules are crunch. Fiddly, to me, is a whole bunch of disconnected if/then statements that are dead simple by themselves but once you've got umpteen simple if/thens to take care of then your brain starts to hurt.

The combat system can be timed out to fractions of a second, you have actual overlays to find out where your bullet/s struck, and there are tons of modifiers depending on distance, speed, how you are standing, the kind of firearm, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, the rest of the game is really just a bunch of mini-games for different situations, which is where the fiddly bit comes from. In all honesty, Aces &amp; Eights is really too much game for me, but I have no doubt I will be lifting some of the mini-games for use with other systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would point to "Cadwallon" RPG as a crunchy but non-fiddly game. It really is a miniatures game overlayed with a role-playing game. I suppose there are elements you could lift and move around, like the attitudes system (which I love, reminds me of Planescape) but I think it all goes together pretty well. Again, probably too much game for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure where something like "Beast Hunters" would fall into these categories, because all of the little fiddly bits really drive the storytelling aspect of the game, and therefore really aren't fiddly after all.

I do feel that aspects of BW like DoW and Fight! are pretty crunchy, but they don't strike me as fiddly.<br/><br/>Anyway... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108910/#Comment_108910" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T18:12:16+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  6:12PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a good measurement of Fiddlyness is how many little +1/-1 thinks you have to add in when making a check to resolve an action.

I just don't equate that with crunch the way I do things like point build in chargen or looking up effects on multiple tables, or computing formula to determine move rates. The math in DitV is pretty easy. Its definitely fiddly in my book (all those things (i.e. resources) to keep track of, but I don't feel the crunch.

The lifepaths provide you with skill, resource, and trait points that get spent during chargen. Just plain addition and then subtraction.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>Likewise, shades introduce extra sets of dice into the rules, rather than relying on one set of dice to resolve all actions (honestly, that in an of itself is pretty fiddly in my eyes).</blockquote>\nEnh. I think it's kind of a nifty way to represent a wide ability range without resorting to big fistfuls of dice. Admittedly, it was a little confusing to a newbie when I ran a one-shot recently, but simply rolling a different colored set of dice helped.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>But don't shades<i>also</i>play into tracking injury and exhaustion?</blockquote>\nThey can figure into determining a PC's wound tolerances, but once those are set, you're just making comparisons. E.g., if a PC has a grey Mortal Wound, a black shade injury isn't going to kill them.<br/><br/>I don't mean to jump on ya, James. I would never deny that BW is pretty crunchy; it definitely has a learning curve. But I've found that curve more of a hurdle than actual in-play fiddly-ness.

In the above and totally fictitious example, the only "choices" might come down to what position the attacker takes and what kind of cover the opponent can find.<br/><br/>Exalted-without-charms would be a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> game.

I don't mean anything negative with these examplesl; I made sure to put examples of games I like in each group.  Also, they vary a lot in crunchiness and fiddliness even among a single category.<br/><br/><b>1.

Fiddly is a pretty subjective term, as it is. I'm just happy with the knowledge that many people whom I know personally agree with me on this issue (i.e., it's nice knowing that I'm not an island) ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
