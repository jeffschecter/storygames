This is the official announcement of my upcoming game, Tabijin. It's an idea that's been mulling around in my head for probably a few years now, and I've recently started working on it in earnest.<br/><br/>Quick Pitch: A game that everyone at the table can pick up and play within minutes. Absolutely every genre, character concept and story idea is easy to implement. The book includes options for solo or group play. It is going to include lots of one-roll generators to create detailed story elements, NPCs, enemies and more on-the-fly.<br/><br/>The game is going to feature a mostly new rules system, which I call the Wanderer System. There are a few elements that a lot of players might recognize as being similar to (but not the same as) certain concepts from Fate, Cortex+, Dungeon World and a few others. Tabijin games often feature characters accomplishing the incredible at some personal cost.<br/><br/>Characters in Tabijin have three Attributes, Body, Heart and Intellect, which each do what you think they do. Attributes have no intrinsic value, but they serve to channel and flavor your efforts.<br/><br/>Skills, possessions, hirelings, property, titles and rank, techniques, relationships and professions are all represented by a single mechanic, called Assets for now. Assets also take the place of XP and plot currency. You get an Asset at the end of every session, and you get to name it and place a Tag on it for easy gameplay reference.<br/><br/>You spend Assets for every action you undertake. Most of the time they refresh at the end of the session. If you want to gain membership in the Thieves Guild, for example, the Storyteller might have you spend your Cat Burglar [Criminal] Asset for that night's session. When you make a roll you can use up to four Assets, which each add +1, to increase your odds of success.<br/><br/>Consequences in conflicts (physical combat, arguments or anything else) cause you to lose your Assets until the end of the session, but you can still use them at the risk of permanent loss.<br/><br/>There are several more mechanics which I won't detail yet for the sake of space, but the above are the broad strokes of the game. As I type, my wife and daughter are out at the movies so I have some time to get more work done. Watch this space if you're interested. I'll be uploading the Alpha document soon.<br/><br/>I'm very open to feedback, questions and criticism, so feel free to post.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441122/#Comment_441122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-02T02:41:30+00:00" title="January  2, 2015  2:41AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you picture a typical session is played out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441123/#Comment_441123" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-02T03:25:03+00:00" title="January  2, 2015  3:25AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The initial setting is going to be a bit of world - building and character  creation. There isn't much to chargen,  which can just take a couple minutes per player. If the Storyteller doesn't have a pre-made world, they can select one or more world archetypes to use. Each player gets a limited say in what they want the Arc to feature.<br/><br/>Once play begins, each session comprises the Storyteller setting scenes and dangling story hooks. Players have their own quests to fulfill, so they have to choose between personal and group goals.<br/><br/>Players use Assets to create elements in a story. A player with an Asset that he calls Ivan [Contact: Business], could play it to decide that he has a lead on a good price for caviar. If they want to do something risky or opposed, then they need to make a challenge roll.<br/><br/>I would like to see each player making a max of 5 or so rolls per session, including combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441125/#Comment_441125" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-02T04:25:21+00:00" title="January  2, 2015  4:25AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a much better pitch, at least in my book. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441126/#Comment_441126" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-02T05:33:10+00:00" title="January  2, 2015  5:33AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what?

(If you did, though, I bet that'd work reasonably well.)  In that case, it might be useful to state what <i>sort</i> of fiction the game is good for before you get into examples.<br/><br/>Any broad strokes?<br/><br/>Right now your examples have me thinking "this game is good for extremely out-there concepts".  Like, if I wanted to try playing an immortal hive-mind colony creature, I might go, "Let's use Tabijin!"  But, uh, that niche might be overly limiting.<br/><br/>Are there any particular types of stories or premises that make you go, "Oh, that'd be <i>perfect</i> for Tabijin!"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441175/#Comment_441175" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T04:03:39+00:00" title="January  5, 2015  4:03AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tabijin can be anything. I'm making it as generic as possible. That's why there are no pre-defined Assets. I forgot to tell about the fairly standard steampunk scenarios and the re-release of the old TURTLE LORDS RPG from 1983. Tabijin is going to be similar to Fate Core or Cortex+ in that it's meant to be modded.<br/><br/>The games that I envision most are heroic struggles. Anything is possible so long as you're willing to pay the Assets. You lose your Assets and get a Burden, but if your problem is still around, you can permanently lose your Assets. This can mean sacrificing your possessions, your relationships or anything else.<br/><br/>I was thematically inspired by Interstellar. SPOILERS: The main character feels obligated to leave on a quest, but in the end he loses his relationship with his family. Tabijin can play like any standard RPG during less-important scenes, but when the high-Challenge Value enemies show up and devastate your Assets, you end up saving the day at great cost. Or not. You might just be awesome enough to have it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441176/#Comment_441176" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-05T04:50:07+00:00" title="January  5, 2015  4:50AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2015 4:53AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

It's pretty quick to make an enemy. Roll 2D6 to get a Challenge Value, and up to 3D8 to determine various types. The 2D6 gets checked against a table to create a value from 4-9, which determines the monster's HP, number of abilities and how frequently they activate. The "types" rolled by the D8s are listed in the book as Fire, Stone, Wind and so forth. Each type has three different abilities to choose from. You can choose one ability from each type for your monster or roll randomly (D6/2).<br/><br/>If you want cosmetic details, habitat, behaviors and all that, there are going to be appropriate tables, but the focus is making sure you have something to fight when you need it.<br/><br/>The system is going to be moddable. Various settings might have new possible monster abilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441325/#Comment_441325" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-11T08:12:11+00:00" title="January 11, 2015  8:12AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  Given that convenience seems to be one of your goals, I must ask, are all these tables on one page, or spread out?  Repeating "roll, flip pages, read" 2 or more times per monster would probably not impress me with its speed and ease.  Rolling once on a single table, and flipping once to the pre-made monster I rolled, would be easier.<br/><br/>I do like the concept of generating unique stuff that isn't repeated!  But I'd pitch it as "uniqueness and variety", not "easy to implement" like in your blurb about one-roll generators.<br/><br/>Just curious: "how frequently they activate" means in terms of combat rounds?  Just getting a handle on what differentiates these randomly-rolled monsters mechanically.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure if 6 effectiveness profiles is enough or not -- it depends on whether you care about varied types of monster <i>encounters</i> beyond types of monster flavor.  Although, if differences in attack type have tactical significance rather than just different color, then perhaps that covers that.  If you wanted to provide more diverse experiences, you could broaden "attack type" to "behavior type" and include things monsters do besides attack.  Turn invisible, flee, take your stuff, shapeshift, etc.<br/><br/>Just spitballin' here, please ignore if not applicable...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441334/#Comment_441334" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-11T20:56:38+00:00" title="January 11, 2015  8:56PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written three supplements in a line dedicated to helping RPG sessions go smoothly or have a richer background. They're at <a href="rpg.drivethrustuff.com/browse/pub/6635/Thunderegg-Productions?affiliate_id=319435" rel="nofollow">my DTRPG page.</a><br/><br/>Each of those supplements uses a system of one-page tables and colored dice for instant results. Tabijin will have something similar in place for any system that might require multiple rolls. If you look at those supplements (they're the ones with the silhouette art over a colored background), they aren't very pretty inside. They're designed for GMs to print at home and share with the table. Tabijin is going to be a PDF and print release, so it will be prettier.<br/><br/>As far as how often abilities activate, that ties into the Black and White Die mechanic. When you roll an attack versus a mook (CV 0-3 bad guy that basically takes a single success to beat), and the White Die shows a 1, then you take 1 damage as they manage to land a hit. Against an elite (CV 4-9 bad guy)*, the White Die becomes a bigger problem. Beyond simple activation and causing 1 damage, the White Die of an elite enemy can trigger additional abilities, such as a Stone bad guy's ability, Lets the hammer fall: +1D6 damage, add the same amount from the White Die next turn for the purpose of triggering abilities only. This ability does extra damage but probably gives you a breather in the next round. The die result which triggers enemy abilities goes up as the CV increases, where at CV 9 any result of 6 or less triggers a hit from the enemy.<br/><br/>Tactics in Tabijin aren't the same as in, say Pathfinder, where you assume your stance, ready whatever, check for flanking and all that. If you can briefly describe a clever use of scene Tags or the enemy's own Tags, then you're in line for a bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441336/#Comment_441336" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-11T22:08:46+00:00" title="January 11, 2015 10:08PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I forgot to mention that I'm taking a page from Microscope, Stars Without Number and the <a href="http://dwssg.averyniceplace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=start" rel="nofollow">Doctor Who Solitaire Storytelling Game</a>.

On a Black 6 you get to introduce a story element from an Asset that you used to boost your roll. <br/><br/>So if you're fighting in a martial arts tournament and you use Body: Open Hand Master [Combat], Body: Acrobatics [Athletics], Body: Scary as All Get-Out [Appearance] and Body: Hits so Hard [Martial Arts], then you could pick, say Scary as All Get-Out to say that you have cowed your audience and can use it as leverage to scare anyone present in the near future. You could pick Acrobatics to say that you're now in a tactical position behind your opponent, and make the case to the Storyteller that you should get a +1 bonus to the White Die (for the purpose of not triggering enemy attacks and abilities only) during the next turn.

Most games try to link repercussions to the action described and talents employed, but I don't think I've ever seen that specific "employ several tags, then pick one for the benefit you get" approach.  <br/><br/>Your example benefits seem highly subjective ("<i>make a case</i> that you <i>should</i> get +1"?), which in my mind clashes with the GM-less option and the premise that these rolls do a lot of the work.

The easiest way to do this is to acquire a patron, or simply generate one at the beginning of the story, then use that patron to generate a quest. Quests get created in a manner similar to enemies. You roll once and consult multiple tables on a single page. The results tell you what you have to do, where you have to go. You'll have to defeat a total CV/overcome traps/explore a certain area/negotiate and what-not until you meet a numerical objective. You get random rewards, from within certain parameters dictated by the quest.<br/><br/>You can also create your own personal quest, but these have to have greater stakes and take more effort.<br/><br/>The whole "make a case that you should" is going to get explained further. Basically, bonuses are any +1 to a roll that you want. The Storyteller isn't going to tell you no, not unless it's incredibly illogical for the story or scene. I'll probably change the terminology to state that you get that bonus, with a sidebar in the storyteller section about overruling illogical or impossible scenarios. If you want a bonus that you earned to be that you do do +1 damage on a success, gain +1 to your roll, gain +1 to the White Die (for the purpose of avoiding enemy attacks and so forth. This actually encourages GM-less play, since you have more options for yourself.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about your final question. I don't understand what you mean when you write about tables to establish results of successful actions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441451/#Comment_441451" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T01:59:40+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  1:59AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2015 2:04AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant that this:<blockquote>you could pick, say Scary as All Get-Out to say that you have cowed your audience and can use it as <i>leverage to scare anyone present in the near future</i>.

There are premade locations, such as cities, forests and so on, or you can create a blank location if you wish.<br/><br/>Locations are either adventuring sites, natural areas or settlements. Adventuring sites might be dungeons, or they could be a military base, an abandoned warehouse, a castle or more. They're the places where you're likely to spend a single session trying to overcome difficulty and find a reward.<br/><br/>Settlements are cities, camps or whatever else you can describe as being capable of acting as a permanent base. You can adventure in a settlement, but you can also use them as hubs to supply yourself, rest or do whatever else you want.<br/><br/>Natural areas are the space between settlements or adventuring sites. They're filled with gorgeous features and wondrous creatures.<br/><br/>Each location has several "rosters". In a premade setting these might already be filled, but in an on-the-fly campaign you create them as you go along. Rosters are essentially encounter tables.<br/><br/>If you have a blank roster, say for enemies, you roll on the table anyway, and then fill the result you rolled with an entry for a brand new enemy. After this point you encounter a version of that enemy whenever you roll that result again. Results of 2 or 12 are high-CV enemies, while 7 are the lowest.<br/><br/>Rosters might include traps and random NPCs, too. In an area like a city, you can also roll for random areas where your exploring might take you. The book's going to have easy-to-make city districts and businesses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
