I'm thankful for things like Push and Secret Wars that hang outside this groupthink and say, yes, we<em>are</em>diverse, we are not all the same and this is another way to make something beautiful.</blockquote>\nSo, I created this game to run for some friends called Cheap. And... for some reason it didn't even occur to me that the session was a playtest, or that it was a game design... it was just Cheap, this thing I made for friday night fun with my friends.<br/><br/>At one point I made an offhand comment about how, in reference to something or other, "yeah, that's exactly how it's supposed to be run". Kirk made a point of saying "that HAS to go into the final rules when you write them."<br/><br/>And I was jolted by this because... when did I ever say that I'd be writing this game down anywhere. He'd just assumed that because it was a roleplaying game and I've published in the past that it should be designed and playtested and ashcanned if I'm not too impatient and printed and sold via indie sales options like IPR.<br/><br/>And I was like, "WTF, since when is this about a market?" And suddenly Cheap felt entirely different, and my goals started to shift in my mind.<br/><br/>Anyways, that's a story.<br/><br/>I want to talk about, in this thread:<br/>a.) exploring alternate ways to celebrate good gaming and good games, other than publishing and selling.<br/>b.) why this publishing mentality is so assumed. If it's a good game, it'll "go to print"?<br/>c.) why "indie" has become such a homogenous thing to some people of late.<br/><br/>Hopefully Shreyas will jump over here shortly and expand his view.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72281/#Comment_72281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T01:17:07+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  1:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess if people think you're good, they want to see you get paid, and publishing is how you get paid for your ideas.<br/><br/>So is this a thread about alternate ways to get paid for the things you design, or is it a thread about how you can have other objectives than getting paid?<br/><br/>I think it's the latter, right?

Latter first:<br/><br/>Obviously there are a bunch of different reasons why you might design games that don't involve at any point having an intention to sell them. A desire for notoriety, an outlet for creativity, a way to make something fun you can share with others just because fun is good.<br/><br/>Depending on your goals, you might be utterly uninterested in distributing the game at all. Plenty of people write fiction and only show it to their friends, or just to themselves. Same with games.<br/><br/>Assuming however that you do want to see the game reaching a wider audience, you have a bunch of possible options, which are probably non-exclusive (that is, you could do many or all of them at once):<br/><br/>* Print on dermand and other such options, like Lulu, which can allow you to "sell" (for cost, or even at a loss I guess) printed copies of your game. If it is important to you to see the thing in print but you aren't too interested in money, this could be good.<br/>* Distribution in PDF or similar via one or more of the big sites, like DriveThruRPG or e23. Probably there are costs involved, which may be a negative if you're looking to get the thing out for free. On the plus side, exposure.<br/>* Stick the PDF or similar on your website. Let people download as they please.<br/>* Put it up onto BitTorerent and the like. Let people share it as they please.<br/>* Make a meme. Design a game that is simple enough to be easily communicated by many vectors - word of mouth and the like - and requires no specialised equipment that you can't make yourself. "Mafia" comes to mind as a successful meme game with some links to roleplaying. "Lexicon" was another good example. If you're making something meant to be transmitted lie this, expect mutation. The thing may become bigger than you. This may be part of the fun: alternately, you might not like to see people hacking around with your work.<br/><br/>Remember: the most widely-spread games are no-one's IP. Poker, chess, tic-tac-toe, tag - the list goes on. If you just want to be influential, or have the maximum number of people possible enjoying your game, abandon all rights to it and stick it out there, and let, nay encourage, others to pass it on.<br/><br/>A good idea might be to establish a centralised website among a group of you. <br/>Using advertising to pay for bandwidth and hosting, perhaps, just form a creative collective, with "a new roleplaying game every week/month/whatever" being the draw. Remember the massive gulf between "free" and "really low cost" - but also remember the perception of value likely to be provoked by each option.<br/><br/>That's all on methods of distribution beyond publishing I have.

People want to see you rewarded for your work, and so they expect publishing as they way you get that.<br/><br/>Part of it is the implicit seal of approval. Some publisher liked your thing enough to think it monetisable, or at least you thought it was good enough that people wanted to pay for it.<br/><br/>Part of it is about how it supposedly demonstrates self-confidence in the value of your work. By making it into a business enterprise, you're demonstrating seriousness about your work, a belief in it. And there's that nagging sense that whatever is given away for free can't be any good.<br/><br/>Part of it is an unfortunate belief that the internet isn't real, that there's still a cachet to being in print, that that makes it official somehow. This one is on the wane, but slowly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72294/#Comment_72294" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T02:12:13+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  2:12AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strangely, I almost have the opposite problem. I've been working on a couple of ideas for a few months now and the reception from my play group has been markedly different depending on my approach to the game. My first attempt was the 'one true game' - a generic system with small setting packs that the players and GM built whilst generating characters. In real life I do quite a bit of project development so I had scoped out a load of the back end stuff and was all over it as something I would indeed 'bring to market'. The initial attitude was totally 'yeah, right, whatever' with an underlying attitude that 'normal' gamers don't ever really succeed in publishing. (akin to how 'normal' fanfic writers never become authors etc). Anyway, that attitude softened a little and the guys were really helpful doing a handful of formal 'playtest and feedback' sessions for me. The game, sadly, has fallen into the doldrums as I realised I had actually written pseudo-Fate without actually having seen it (doh!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second attempt, which is ongoing now, is a Sharpe-inspired game. I've made it clear to everyone that because of the source material etc. this is just going to be a fun thing for me to do and nothing that even approaches serious. Everyone was very open and happy to have a test run with none of the seriousness that accompanied the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it could have been that they have become used to my slow transformation into an RPG 'Mad Professor' type, or that they have some sort antipathy with the idea of me making money from their playtime - I dunno. I suspect that sometimes that 'people like us can't be published' attitude that comes from a lot of hobbies may be sourced in a sort of pedestal-plopping attitude that is made of people who have 'made it'. Someone who has name recognition has 'made it'.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe the desire to 'make it' and be a bigger fish in a small pond is what leads this expectation to publish? The notion that everyone naturally wants to improve and grow and climb higher up the pyramid of celebrity?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that crossed my mind is that it is possibly fuelled by a sort of backlash against the sharing nature of RPGs? We live in a rather callous world where everything appears to have it's price and sharing for sharings sake is a pretty rare thing. The act of taking part in a roleplaying game - sharing your time and creative energy for the entertainment of others - is one of the few ways I can actively 'give' to my friends. Maybe the urge to publish is seen as 'getting something back' from the gaming hobby?? It sounds a bit far fetched I know, but it has crossed my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, enough of my piffle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72296/#Comment_72296" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T02:22:13+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  2:22AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alternate ways to monetise:<br><br>Ok, so we know how print publishing works (both on-demand, online through a centralised distributor/e-tailer or not, and also in brick-and-mortar stores). We also know how e-publishing works - paid for PDFs or similar, bought in much the same manner as physical goods over the Internet, again either through a dedicated retailer or not).<br><br>Say you don't like that model. How else can you get paid? Again, these ideas could be mixed, matched and combined.<br><br>* Produce work for free, but then ask for donations. Advantage: anyone can go grab your work and check you out. You can get the goodwill first, inclining people to reward you later. No-one can claim to be disappointed in their purchase. Disadvantage: relies on people being altruistic toward you.<br><br>* Produce work for free, and then stick it on an advertising-based website for download. Advantage: people can still get your stuff for free. Disadvantages: advertising revenues aren't necessarily going to be great. To sustain the model, you'll need to ensure that your website is the ONLY place your game can be acquired from (for free, anyway).<br><br>* Similarly: produce work for free that INCLUDES ads as part of the product. Here you don't have to worry about people redistributing it since the ads are built in (although you might have cause to worry about people stripping the ads out somehow). Also, inserting ads may uglify the product in a way you're uncomfortable with. Potentially there is room for immense subtlety here: product placement in RPGs? Why not?<br><br>* In a similar but slightly more nefarious vein, it might even be possibly to make an RPG that was itself part and parcel of a viral marketing campaign. Think for example of the Alternate Reality Games used to promote Halo 2, the NBC TV series Heroes or the new Nine Inch Nails album. You get paid either through sales of the advertised product directly (if you're selling that), or possibly on commission...<br/><br/>* Commission! Someone else pays you to make the game. Possibly they do this for advertising purposes, as above. Possibly they do it just because they want a game made to specification, like they want a game about sadomasochistic elves or something. Obviously this might compromise your artistic integrity. And you'd have to be pretty well-known and respected to get people to go for it. Customers might argue with you about contracts, quality and time of delivery, etcetera.<br/><br/>* Ransoms! Here you produce a thing and set a price for what you think it's worth. Then people can make donations toward it. When the price is met, you release the product free for all and collect the money! This is a nice model that combines getting a fair value for the amount of work you put in (set by you), with the advantages of free distribution of the complete work after the ransom is met. No worries about piracy either - simply don't release the product at all until you have the money. However, careful thought is needed. What do you do if the ransom isn't met? You might need a system for giving people their money back after a set time. People may feel resentful that they paid and other get it for free, and this can lad to a stand-off where no-one is willing to put forward money cause they're all waiting for some other sucker to do it first. Greg Stolze has used this system to sell RPGs, with what degree of success I can't say.<br/><br/>* Subscription. Peoples sign up and pay X per month, or maybe just a one time membership fee, and thereby get access to all the stuff you make. Aagin, you'd need to be a hard-ass about seeing to it that the stuff didn't get redistributed so as to be available from other than you. People on monthly subscriptions may want guarantees about amount and quality of output. On the other hand, a one time fee becomes problematic as your portfolio expands: 5$ seemed reasonable when that gave access to three game, but now you have thirty, aren't they getting in a little cheaply? But turning around and asking for more money isn't likely to go down well. You might have a stratified system (Bronze/Silver/gold members) with differing privileges, but this can quickly become almost the same as just selling each thing individually. Might work better as part of a larger collective of RPG authors.<br/><br/>More as I think of them...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72298/#Comment_72298" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T02:48:51+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  2:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I propose this mentality: Go Play. (Okay, I'm just being smug.)<br/><br/>I think any "publishing mentality" just came about because it's really easy to fart around and have a game "in the works" indefinitely and get discouraged and never make any serious effort to publish it, so in the last several years there's been a focus on encouraging and rewarding people who actually buckle down and do the hard work of getting their games into some presentable, playable form. Except the pendulum's swung too far in that direction, and now people (apparently) feel like they MUST PUBLISH to reap indie cred, at the expense of other fundamental things like design and testing.<br/><br/>I'm really interested to see how the Ashcan Front takes off. It sounds like it's really getting back to the roots of "publish" meaning "get your stuff out there so people can play it" as opposed to "create a commercially viable product from scratch."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72304/#Comment_72304" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T05:03:14+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  5:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking in the abstract, if you've got something awesome I want you to share it.  <br/><br/>b) Sharing it involves getting it heard.  I think there is an idea that the best way to have an idea heard is to charge people money for it, and put a pretty face on it.  Personal experience leads me to suspect this to be true.  So a lot of time people will use the language of money just to try to talk about the value of something.  "This is good" becomes "This is worth money" because if you say "this isn't worth money," a lot of people hear "this isn't good".<br/><br/>a) Ways to celebrate good games?  Play them!  Beyond performing an activity, celebrating involves sharing; finding other people who play them, and talking about them.  Sharing experiences.<br/><br/>That, or start a roast over a bonfire.  Celebration through eating lots of food together is a time honored classic.<br/><br/>c) Maybe the cultural influence of the community on the work of it's members?  If "indie" becomes a community and develops a culture, then there <em>is</em> some homogenization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72313/#Comment_72313" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T05:54:48+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  5:54AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a fascinating phenomenon, to be sure. But there are some people, John Kim especially, who have completely the opposite opinon, and who propound this openly. That is, he says that there are simply way too many RPGs produced, period. His encyclopedia is testament that he's probably correct. I'm not quite as far out on that limb, but I've often questioned people on whether they're ready to actually publish something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's become very easy to produce a physical product. Which has lead to a proliferation of them. But that doesn't mean that every one of them should be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what the "indie culture" promotes, while the ease of production may create a rush to publish, the community as a whole always says the same thing, "Test your game out first, and thoroughly!" For my part I try to help people out by giving thorough criticism of their games. Which I hope says to somebody, "This needs work, fix it up before you do anything with it."<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, the "indie culture" lauds stuff like Push and other attempts to head off in other directions. From what I can tell, we support any and all alternate publishing models, or non-publishing models.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, there definitely is a tendency for people to want to get their game out. I think that it's ironic that things have gone from rampant perfectionism where projects often take forever to get published and usually never do (good in most cases, but bad in a few), to where large numbers of games are getting published too soon. The fact that in previous times you had to stake a small fortune to get into publishing meant that all but the most dedicated were winnowed out. Now anybody can test the waters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so they do. I'll even cop to having put stuff out in less than fully baked form. Cell Gamma had the barest minimum of playtesting, and strongly relies on GM force of will to succeed, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that all happens despite the warnings not to rush to publication. The temptations are strong, and vary by publisher. It's like the software industry, the error now will be all about how fast the publisher rushed to publish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, like any temptation, I'm not sure that we can prevent it. All we can do is tell people that they should take their time, and let them make their own mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72318/#Comment_72318" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T06:36:28+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  6:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It helps to get burned by your own impatience, I think.

I know there are some differing definitions out there - some people don't seem to consider free products to be published for whatever reason - but I'm content witht he simple yardstick being that a game is published when a) it can get in someone else's hands without you giving it to them directly and b) you don't need to apologize or qualify the content.  A is pretty much just a matter of logistics, but B is a pretty big deal.<br><br>B means your work is out there to be critiqued, reviewed and generally torn apart.  If it's flawed, expect every flaw to be hilighted, and if it's perfect, expect every flaw to be highlighted.  If it's commercially successful, expect to be reviled and resented for it. If it's a commercial flop, expect to feel like you *suck*.  Expect people to wipe their asses with your labor of love.  I respect that, and the guy who rushes his product out the door to chase that respect is going to suffer far more than any criticism I can ever mete out.  It's self correcting, so far as I'm concerned.<br><br>Beyond that, I dunno. This idea of publication being a bar of entry into the cool kids club pretty much makes me scratch my head.

It's a fantastic place to pause and garner feedback, dipping your toe in the water.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72443/#Comment_72443" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T13:05:21+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  1:05PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p><em><strong>Posted By: komradebob</strong></em></p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p><em><strong>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</strong></em></p>\n<p>3)<strong>Teaching people how to play through audio or video.</strong> YouTube or podcasts would be a spectacular way to teach people how to play a game, assuming you're interested in teaching people who can't come learn from you in person.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I could've sworn that someone had posted a link to a boardgame company site that does this, but I can't remember he name of the company.

I'm not actually meaning to say "fix this up and publish it", I'm meaning to say "I think this is really cool and want to celebrate this in whatever way I can. One such way is to develop it into an indie games product and put it into the market, but that's just one way. How can I celebrate what you've created?"<br/><br/>Let me add that I have a huge agenda when it comes to independant roleplaying games, within my community (Vancouver, BC). I want people talking about them, enhancing them as an artform, playing like mad, sharing like mad, developing a community. And I want it to be a lot of different things at once. I want to celebrate roleplaying games, and I want to see someone on the bus and feel proud about recognizing them as a gamer and talking and sharing.<br/><br/>And so "celebration" of an art form is what I'm all about right now, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach that with altnerative frameworks to the "marketplace" mentality, and if that marketplace mentality should fit into it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72542/#Comment_72542" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T18:45:35+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  6:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>A friend of mine, Brian King, had some instructional videos for his game,<em>Fates Worse Than Death</em>.

I don't know what he used to put together his video, other than the basic editing package (t@b ZweiStein)... which, in my opinion, sucks. I could not get it to work with even the basic functionality of Virtualdub.</p>\n<p>What I wanted to do was use machinima techniques to create videos. However, I was having problems getting skins properly added to models. Quake and Quake 2 are both under the GPL now, and tools for movie making are available for both, but the documentation for how to replace all the art assets -- which you would have to do if you wanted to create commercial animation -- is spotty at best, and even that small bit that's available is so illiterate it's barely comprehensible. This doesn't matter so much for replacing floor and wall textures or creating maps, because you can eventually figure it out, but there's some kind of gap between the instruction on how to create models and skins and how to get the skin to actually show up in the game.</p>\n<p>The animation I have done successfully took so long that I decided it really wasn't going to be worth it. I have a 3-minute music video I did in Bryce thatg took about a month. I still toy with the idea, though.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
