They'd get people with high-powered gaming PCs to do quick interviews about their equipment.  In this spirit, I've started this thread for <b>Show Us Your Rig: GM Edition</b> (or MC Edition, or Keeper Edition, or...).  What equipment do you like to use to run games, and how do you use it?  Do you prefer physical books, printed handouts, or PDFs on a tablet?  How do you make, organise, and store campaign notes?<br/><br/>The questions PC Gamer always asked were:<br/>-What's your rig?<br/>-What's the most interesting or unique part of your setup?<br/>-What's always within arm's reach?<br/>They also asked what you were playing right now, but we've got other threads for that, so, if you're using these questions as prompts, I'm going to suggest a fourth of my own:<br/>-Have the practicalities of your rig ever changed the way you play?  In other words, would you be playing exactly the same stories if your physical equipment were completely different?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/13Clocks" title="13Clocks"><img alt="13Clocks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/13Clocks">13Clocks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474196/#Comment_474196" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-27T12:44:53+00:00" title="May 27, 2018 12:44PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What's your rig?</b><br/>I've recently started using a laptop.  I keep the rulebook as a PDF open in one tab and my character and setting notes in another.  I can also use an Excel spreadsheet to simulate a hundred dice rolls and just pull one from the list every time I need to roll.  I wouldn't recommend doing this for everyone, but it might speed things up if only the GM does it.  The other benefit is that my laptop is a huge, power-hungry monster, and it's also getting old, so the battery lasts almost exactly as long as a decent-length session does.  As a rule of thumb, I know to hurry the final major event along as soon as power save mode kicks in.<br/><br/><b>What's the most interesting or unique part of your setup?</b><br/>I can download and display concept art at a moment's notice.  If my players are boarding a derelict space station, I can show a slideshow of five or six quick images to set the scene as I narrate.<br/><br/><b>What's always within arm's reach?</b><br/>Spare dice.  We play a lot of the sort of games where you wind up rolling a handful of d6s at once, and having a massive grab pile speeds things up dramatically.<br/><br/><b>Have the practicalities of your rig ever changed the way you play?</b><br/>Not exactly, but they've made it a bit richer.  Recently, I'd created a setting which had talking wolves, just as a bit of set-dressing.  My players decided that a pack of talking wolves would make good allies and decided to try to get them on their side.  The practical upshot of this was that I unexpectedly had to roleplay a wolf.  Because I had the laptop there, I could call up a picture of a wolf to add some visual stimulus.  I'm considering getting a cheap second screen, just to sit on the end of the table, where I can show this sort of picture without having to turn the laptop around or minimise my notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474202/#Comment_474202" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-27T21:13:49+00:00" title="May 27, 2018  9:13PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2018 9:19PM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -What's your rig?<br/>I have stuff printed in 10 cm thick folders, according to setting (Medieval / Fantasy, Cyberpunk, SpaceOp), genre (quickdraw one shots) or system (Hero, WoD).

As a result it kickstarts player's creativity as everyone feels more relaxed about producing material for the game.<br/><b>-What's always within arm's reach?</b><br/>The deck, it helps me come up with many different surprising things on the spot, all it needs is a slight effort to keep everything related and in context.<br/><b>-Have the practicalities of your rig ever changed the way you play?
