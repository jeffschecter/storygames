                    "Inspired by this thread":http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=694, I was thinking about space opera again. Any ideas on how best to compromise between science (relativity, physics, etc.) and the fun aspects of space opera? Got any fiction or games that has done this well already?<br/>
<br/>
Here's some features I'm used to:<br/>
<br/>
* You can have a ship that can go between worlds for mercenary purposes.<br/>
* It can be staffed by a relatively small crew, and run as an independent operations. It is not prohibitively expensive. (In other words, analagous social and economic structures as seen in Firefly and Traveller.)<br/>
* Travel between worlds is feasible; travelling from A to B does not mean that you've moved 500 years into the future and everyone you know is dead.<br/>
* Cultural, you can treat a world of people as analagous to a single country or territory in our modern sensibility.<br/>
<br/>
Of these, I definitely think the fourth is expendable (and should be expended) but I'm not sure about another good mental model of what other world will be like. As for the other three: I feel like they're pretty important to much of the space opera _feel_, but I'm really interested in alternatives.                </div>

Personally, I think the idea of quasi-immortal mercenary crews, only aging one year on voyages that take 1000, is pretty awesome.  But your mileage, apparently, varies.<br/>

                            Dev - the best "hard science" (or at least semi-hard science) RPG I know is GURPS Transhuman Space.  The core book is definitely worth checking out--system aside, it's full of mind-blowingly cool stuff.  The trouble is there's no "core story" there, though it wouldn't be hard to invent such a thing.<br/>
<br/>
Inspired by one of Vernor Vinge's books, I thought of a setting where you've got several colonized systems.  But there's always the chance that these colonies will undergo social or technological collapse.  So you've got "Dogs in the Spaceyards" who represent the Cultural Reboot Organization, and they go on 1,000 year circuits, showing up with what seems like Super Science to bust heads on the barbaric worlds and restore the proper culture.                        </div>

                            How about the <i>Hyperion</i> series?  You'd have to remove a lot of the teleportation, and make it so that only ships can do it, but there's really nothing like space travel powered by DOOM.  I won't say any more for fear of spoilers, but I think it's a great inspiration for space opera.<br/><br/>Ben: I love the quasi-immortal mercenaries idea.  IIRC there was something like that mentioned in the second <i>Ringworld</i> book, with trading ships and their immortal crews swinging by the Ringworld every few hundred years.  Of course, this too turns out to be DOOM.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>To be more helpful, let me take those 3 bullet points I care about and try to strip the actual meta needs that they fulfill, and see if there are better mechanisms to fulfil them.</p>
<p>I want protagonists to be able to be part of an independent clique of people, with mutual material needs. I'd like them in a position where they have some power to leverage, and yet are still relatively small and can find themselves to be the underdog in many situations. I want to make sure the power is theirs to leverage; if they are part of a very large hierarchical organization, they will have to deal with either taking orders from those above them, or managing those below.</p>
<p>I wanted some continuity, and I was worried about the time travel in the Space Opera, but I think I just came around to it. (If each trip is a big jump forward in time, all that matters is the continuity within your own crew, and between your allies/rivals who are in similar work as you.)</p>

                            The more I think about it, the more "all-in-one system" could be really, really cool.  Set it 100,000 years in the future, after Mars, Venus, Europa, Io, Ganymede, and Triton have been colonized, society has collapsed, and all of the planets have developed some on their own, resulting in complicated geo-political and cultural systems, and even a fair share of micro-evolution (similar to modern human "races") amongst the planets.<br/>
<br/>
You could do some really fun "age of sail" sorts of things with that set-up, and you'd also have a chance to invent all sorts of new human cultures.  Give some of the planets (mars, say) the technology to easily synthesize rocket-fuel and a space voyage would be about comparable to a sea voyage in terms of time and money investment.                        </div>

                            Cherryh's <i>Morgaine</i> saga does this really well, though with a combo of sci-fi and fantasy elements.  The group has high-tech gear and is traveling forward in time through some kind of not-well-explained wormholes from world to world on a Crucial Mission.  Because most of the world are not high-tech, they have a lot of power compared to others, but it's a limited resource and they mostly can't replace it.  Also there are only a few of them so they can always be overpowered or overrun.  It never really tries to explain the science very well, but it does your three things fairly well and in an interesting setting.<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>Edit: Man, I keep thinking of good examples of small groups which are mutually dependent, have some power but not too much, and are fairly independent - but I can't think of ones that handle the science particularly well.  I may have to ponder this for a bit.                        </div>

                            Dev, another reasonably hard ("semi-soft") idea for science-fiction--  the Omega Point Theory.  A quick RPG sketch of such a thing here: <br/>
<br/>
http://alternityrpg.net/onlineforums/index.php?showtopic=272<br/>
<br/>
Summarizing: malevolent space-gods existing inside a black hole created by the destruction of the universe, except the black hole is actually a enormous super computer, and what you experience as reality is almost certainly a VR simulation.<br/>
<br/>
The author of the theory, Frank Tipler, is a physics professor who studies this stuff professionally, and apparently really believes that it's true.  Apparently it's susceptible to experimental verification, assuming certain cosmological constants are true.  (Obviously this is not a mainstream scientific belief.)                        </div>

<p>Well, there's a lot of good "hard science fiction," but it's far from space opera.</p>
<p>Hey, <a href="http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/session/index.html" rel="nofollow">Cowboy Bebop</a> is almost hard SF. They just threw in jumpgates so the characters didn't take months to get between planets. The movie also has a lame "magic nanotech" plot.</p>
<p>Like Stack says, do check out Transhuman Space, which could be drifted to space opera with some effort, as well as Vinge's <em>A Deepness In The Sky</em>, the latter of which would basically be hard SF if the reader didn't know a few odd facts about the cosmology. A pretty cool interstellar STL society is described.</p>

                            Another concept:<br/>
<br/>
You've got a Von Neumann machine rocketing through space.  It shows up in a solar system, begins carving up asteroids/terraforming viable worlds, and then seeds it with DNA samples.  (Actually, a Von Neumann probe could probably store the human genome, artificial wombs, and the sum total of human knowledge pretty easily.  So, it could set up an actual colony of its own.)<br/>
<br/>
Then the probe builds a bunch of copies of itself, and sends them off to the nearby worlds.  Within 300,000,000 years, it will have colonized the entire galaxy.  This sounds real complicated, but all you gotta do is build one probe and send it off.  The rest takes care of itself.  (This is one version of the Fermi Paradox: if aliens exist, why aren't they here already?)                        </div>

<br/>
So on my side, I have my meta concerns about the makeup of the group. I'm pretty sure I need those, but I'm willing to look at out-of-the-box approaches to them. If I can get those meta concerns + space ships, I'm pretty good. As for science, I'm willing to assume the presence of very difficult / unlikely (but not impossible) technology, and I'm willing to simply cover up some possible-but-undesirable possibiltiies. For example, I'm pretty sure that, if I my ship can travel at any relativistic speeds, that your friendly little Firefly class cruiser can cause catastrophic and fatal damage to an entire planet. I'm willing to simply say "oh, no one is going to do that" if need be, even if it's technically possible.                        </div>

Kip Thorne's last chapter of "Black Holes and Baby Universes" works out the theory a little bit.  You've got these things called wormholes, which are tiny little shortcuts through space.  Wormholes generally exist on the quantum scale, and even then only for a super-tiny amount of time, because any amount of matter, like stray subatomic particles, passing through pinches the wormhole shut.  <br/>
<br/>
But if you could thread the wormhole with strands of exotic matter with "negative mass," it would prop the wormhole open, and you could gradually widen it.  There are two difficulties here: one, nobody knows what "negative mass" means or how we could make it; two, if we could make it, it would probably be super-difficult and super-expensive.  By which I mean, we'd probably be so powerful that we can't conceive of meaningful human drama at that scale.<br/>
<br/>
But you could set up something like an ancient, long-vanished civilization that established those things as a transit network.  It's not bad science, it's just crazily speculative.                        </div>

                            Also, Dev -- check out Anders Sandberg, who is a mad genius and was thinking about this stuff too, once upon a time: http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/BigIdeas/<br/>
<br/>
(Especially: Higgs field technology, for anti-grav and FTL travel-- http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/BigIdeas/higgs.html<br/>
<br/>
Anders pretty much freakin' hides the plot of his campaign, but it goes like this: a conspiracy forms between some weird-ass aliens and human beings, to figure out a way to create an interface between their minds.  They work up an experimental gadget to create telepathy, but it ends up getting loose on an inhabited planet and causes chaos.  The PC's show up to figure out (a) what's going on, (b) who's responsible, and (c) how to stop it before it destroys civilization.)<br/>

And also, read Bruce Sterling's novel "Schismatrix Plus."  It's got some cool ideas in it.                        </div>

<br/>
It's probably because we're not operating from a shared definition of "plausible."  I'm taking it as, "Whatever hasn't been disproven," which is quite different from, "Whatever has been proven."  Thus, aliens of some kind are plausible to me--but, say, the "terraform in a minute" Genesis Torpedo from Star Trek II isn't.<br/>
<br/>
Wormholes, quantum foam, and zero-point energy are speculative, but theories about them are at least published in peer-reviewed journals, even if they're contested and problematic.  Personally, I'm tired of that stuff and would prefer to see how far you could go with strictly STL, but at least it isn't straight-out anti-science.                        </div>

Dev, Jovian Chronicles is pretty close to what you're looking for. <br/>
<br/>
The thing about space opera for me is that it has to keep humans human. I don't have much in common with human beings from 10K years ago. How can I relate to human beings who have advanced to godlike status?<br/>
<br/>
The other problem with any kind of sci fi  game is the learning curve. The more different your setting conventions are, the more homework the players have to do. In Firefly and Serenity, technology and setting details are mostly in the back seat, and people are still regular people who feel love and greed and fear and so on. In that regard, keeping it in this solar system = good. I'm sure at least one in ten college graduates can name half the planets.                        </div>

<br/>
If you have enough engineering and energy to be able to throw ships around the solar system, you've got enough engineering and energy to terraform the moons of Jupiter.<br/>
<br/>
For example, let's say you wanted to warm up one of those icy Jovian moons and melt yourself water ocean.  Simple!<br/>
<br/>
Jupiter is about five AU from the sun.  That means that it gets about 1/25 as much sunlight as Earth.<br/>
<br/>
You take a huge quantity of aluminized mylar reflector, set it up in orbit around Jupiter so that it focuses the sunlight onto one half of the moon's surface, and in a few decades you get a nice warm water ocean.<br/>
<br/>
Ganymede's radius is roughly 2,600 KM.  This means that the area of its cross-section is around 21 million km^2.  You'll want a reflector with about 700 million square kilometers (7x10^8) because the stuff has a bolometric albedo around .9... you lose a little bit of heat in the reflection.<br/>
<br/>
Aluminized mylar under current industrial conditions is about 7 g/m^2, or about 7,000 kg per km^2.  This means that the reflector would weigh around 5x10^12 kilograms.<br/>
<br/>
A modern oil supertanker has a mass of around 200 million kg (2x10^8).  This means that all you need to do is have enough industrial capacity to build and ship the equivalent of 2.5x10^4 or 25,000 supertankers.  That's not inconcievable.<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to do the same closer in, like in the Asteroids or Mars orbit, it's even easier.                        </div>

                            Answering your whisper, Fred, I'm *very* familiar with Thorne's work, both popular and not.  What he's knowingly ignoring (and doing it for the purposes of making a nifty point) is that there is no simultaneous time reference -- any FTL is fundamentally time travel.<br/>
<br/>
In general, guys, a plea:  If you don't like what I'm saying, that's fine.  Please don't say "actually ... " and quote Thorne or any other SF-writing physicist.  I'm incredibly familiar with those guys, what they have to say, and the mathematics behind what they're saying.  I've done most of the equations myself.<br/>

It's not that I mind them being brought up, I just don't particularly want to argue with them.  Thanks.<br/>

                            bq. Wormholes, quantum foam, and zero-point energy are speculative<br/>
<br/>
Okay, plausibilty being a raised question: ZPE is where I draw the line.  Wormholes, quantum foam, tachyons (and actually tachyons suggest a sci-fi plausibility to FTL and non-relativistic travel) are all at least within the realm of amusing speculation.  But ZPE is the TimeCube's cousin in the realm of merest fantasy, and I'll listen to no more about it.<br/>

As a different compromise point between space opera and hard SF, why not put your near-light mercenaries on the leading edge of a human diaspora.  That would let them land on a planet colonized decades or centuries previously, do their thing, and then move on to the next world to catch up with longer-flight colonists.  Of course, they could go back, but if they do they leave humanity as they know it forever.  Or do they?  Maybe there's enough wiggle room in relativistic travel that you could run alongside other colonists to their destination and find profit and adventure with them.  And of course, the most valuable prize available would be the updated 5000 Year Plan for the Diaspora.  Because otherwise how do you know where you're going?                        </div>

<p>Oddly enough, implausibility doesn't bother me <em>that</em> much, all things considered. Nonetheless, the previous thread made me consider how anti-science a space opera setting needs to be to adhere to its traditional needs; I just felt <em>silly</em> about expecting FTL without breaking the universe, or terraforming in anything less than centuries. So I'm trying to find a different approach to the setting, but, if it was just me, I'm pretty sure I could make peace with zooming around in a SillyDrive FTL engine and playing around with space operatic color.</p>

                            One thing you might consider is, instead of redesigning the facts of the setting, redesign the message. Make it deconstructive rather than something new. A TON of space opera has done this. Firefly's Alliance is absolutely a response to Star Trek's Federation, for example. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of times I hear players sniggering about this or that scientific implausibility in space opera (or some other soft sf game) and really what they want is not plausibility - they just want to pull apart some other source material for laughs and thrills. You can approach them with a very different strategy.                        </div>

                            For FTL to work in a good SF it needs to have a set of laws, which while not necessarily compatible with physics express limitations on what that drive can do (much like magic in a good fantasy game).  They you can explore the universe that emerges from the results of those limitations.<br/>
<br/>
Consider GDW's jump drive. Communication is lilmited to the speed of travel and the edge of Empire lies two years away from the fore. The result is to create   something remniscent of the Roman or British empires where local governors must have power to make decisions but too much power leads to rebellious provinces.<br/>
<br/>
 Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have a pretty good system with the Alderson Drive in their Future History/Mote In God's Eye books with a failry readable pseudo-science explanantion - gravitational fields distort the fabric of space creating canyons down which ships can travel at FTL speeds. Access points to hypersoace are limited to the edge of gravitional fields of stars - allowing space battles. The conciet of the Mote in God's Eye comes from the fact that the motie homeworlds jump point to the nearest system exits within a star.<br/>
<br/>
This is the mechanism of  soft SF - put humans into a different system and see how their society would develop. It is stronger than soft SF but more open to adventure.<br/>
<br/>
The other rule of soft SF is you are only allowed a limited number of 'breakages' to what we understand now. Two is the usually quoted number, though they often seem to end up as a half-dozen. But limit yourself and define what is broken clearly.                        </div>
