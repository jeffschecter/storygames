(On the other hand, if it's a fistfight between two people, bystanders typically stand around the fight and yell and cheer and place bets, and that's fun, too.)<br/><br/>I usually have more trouble when it comes to first responders like cops and firefighters and EMTs; in a modern setting, those guys could absolutely be on the scene of a fight well before the fight is over, and their jobs could definitely put them in the middle of it.  But the problem for me as a GM is not how to make them feel like real people, it's just the overhead of tracking them on top of everything else I'm trying to keep track of.  They're a hassle because of the bookkeeping involved and because of the time I'd have to spend each round describing what they're doing, not because I can't think of what they would realistically be doing.  Honestly, I usually "cheat" this by having them establish some kind of perimeter around the fight and stand off until the fighting's over; it's not necessarily realistic, but it's easier on me and keeps the focus of each combat round squarely on the PCs and the NPCs they're fighting.  Or I set up the premise of the game in such a way that the PCs <i>are</i> the first responders, or have a reason to never want to get the attention of the police, so that they will either describe to me what the cops are doing or they will manipulate the situation in order to keep the cops out of it.

For example...<br/><br/>"The Ebola monkeys escape from their cages when your concussion blast blows right through one of the Collective Worker's many duplicates. Now, the Monkeys are an 8 dice complication, and they're trying to escape. Sets rolled for the monkeys mean they get away, threatening... well... who's not immune to Ebola? Yeah, pretty much everybody in the city."<br/><br/>All sets rolled for these generalized things are used.<br/><br/>Then, players can take decisive action to counter these things, and it works just like gobble dice. Creative strategies are encouraged to deal with this stuff.<br/><br/>"Oh hell. I'm going to split my action and use my Purple Telekinesis to scoop them back into their cages and swat some more of the Collective Worker's dupes."<br/><br/>Sometimes, complications can hurt you. In this case, the sets do damage based on how nasty they are (tell the players up-front if this is on the table so they can make reasonable decisions about how to deal with it).<br/><br/>All kinds of ways to use this...<br/><br/>Innocents are in trouble! (6d) - sets represent innocent people being hurt or killed in the melee.<br/><br/>The building is on fire! (8d) - sets represent attacks/damage on people inside, or prevent easy movement or escape.<br/><br/>Girl Punch is Freaking Out Because the Time Tunnel Obeys Terminator Rules And now Everybody is Naked! (7d) - sets represent the body-conscious Girl Punch freaking out and getting everyone into worse trouble.<br/><br/>Goddamn paparazzi! (5d) - sets mean embarrassing pictures will be taken and published, leading to public humiliation and possible legal action.<br/><br/>Everybody has a Camera Phone (10d) - like Goddamn paparazzi! except it'll be YouTube for everybody, and sets of 10's will mean it goes viral.</blockquote>\nWhat I like about things like this is that it lets you use a little mechanical thing to abstract the trouble of tracking a crowd at the same time as it gives the crowd some possible mechanical effects and focuses some of the color that everyone can use when they're narrating about the crowd. <br/><br/>Like, in the last example with the camera phone -- you know the crowd is probably not trying to hurt you, maybe is getting out of the way (though maybe is being oblivious in the way folks with cameras sometimes are), but probably also isn't leaving the area. Thus its pretty easy to put that out there, and everyone can use it in their descriptions. It also lets you get the whole "well Jesus, how do I deal with a mob of camera toting idiots" down to "well, can you beat a 2x6 and a 3x4?" <br/><br/>So, yea, that's what I like. Different games do this differently well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209632/#Comment_209632" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T20:18:18+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  8:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's kinda neat.

But removing NPCs from the battlefield removes a great opportunity to complicate an otherwise standard fight.  So I want to get better at using NPCs as part of the 'terrain' of the battlefield, offering different PCs the chance to shine in either helping or leading NPCs.  In Spirit of the Century, bystanders and NPCs can be pre-existing scene Aspects that players or I can tag during the scene to demonstrate the bystanders' impact.  Alternately, players can use maneuvers to introduce or influence NPCs--a successful Leadership maneuver turns an unruly mob into an effective militia or whatever--captured mechanically by a new Aspect.  I try to apply this general idea in other games, too--a successful action by a PC dealing with bystanders has some mechanical effect on future conflict rolls. <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209697/#Comment_209697" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-30T22:00:40+00:00" title="May 30, 2009 10:00PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great houserule for ORE.
