Most of the advice boiled down to "it's a learned skill." I want something much more mechanical than that. I want the game to end the scene when a certain stipulation for the scene is met. And I want the game to be able to satisfy and not seem to have arbitrarily ended the game.<br/><br/>My reason for wanting this is that I'm looking back at <a href="http://www.emptygamebox.com/empty/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pilgrimage-by-bryan.pdf" rel="nofollow">Pilgrimage [pdf - 524kb]</a>, my 2007 Game Chef entry, and I'm trying to figure out how to make end a scene more satisfying. In Pilgrimage, I stole a Breaking the Ice mechanic where the actions and traits of a character get narrated to earn dice. The dice are rolled and a result of a 5 or 6 wins the scene. If a scene was played out beautifully and lost to a dice roll, it is very unrewarding, especially for the dreamy-looking-back-on-life-did-I-accomplish-enlightenment-type of play I'm going for.<br/><br/>What are the different ways that game mechanics can end a scene? And what games, in your opinion, do this well?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183216/#Comment_183216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T14:20:53+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  2:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Until we Sink" ends a scene when two characters have left the location. (So, if you and I and three other players are playing, and I say "I leave the scene", whenever one of you leaves as well, the scene ends). Great, simple, subtle mechanic. When the first character leaves, the remaining players know the scene will probably end soon, but they still have time to wrap it up; and the first player who decides to leave can't automatically end the scene. If you have your character leave too early, you risk sitting around for a long time with nothing to do while the others continue the scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183267/#Comment_183267" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T21:39:52+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  9:39PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Capes' rule -- once the last conflict in a scene is resolved, that scene ends.  If I remember right, Story Engine does the same thing, since it has scene-based resolution:  the conflict is set up, resolution is done, and the rest is just description of that resolution.  Anything further is another scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

The players took turns to keep the time. In a current minigame I'm working on, the key scene ends when every character have said exactly one line - I'm playtesting this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
