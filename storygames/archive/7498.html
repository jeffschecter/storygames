I've avoided putting in the mechanical consequences of missions. Add your own missions to the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecret Weapons Test:<br/>\nOrders to the Sergeant: You are to test a new device - Code Zero. Assign one trooper to activate the Device. When you engage the enemy, all other troopers are to retreat to Far range, assigned trooper to activate the device, then disengage if possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nPsychic Alien Riders:<br/>\nOrders: A colony of settlers has been taken over by psychic aliens. Ignore their human-sounding pleas for mercy - they are excellent mimics. Destroy all life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrugs Test<br/>\nOrders: All troopers, but not NCOs are to take Substance Blue before engaging the enemy the first time. On completion of contact, take Substance Red.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrugs Test 2<br/>\nBefore landfall, all troopers are forceably injected with Revelation, a new combat drug (NFA to avoid). During the final combat, (while tokens still remain) their vision starts flickering, and it appears they have been engaged with other Terran troopers. This is a residual hallucination, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolar Flare<br/>\nOrders: Apparently low-tech aliens are responsible for a solar flare which engulfed the fleet. Destroy the aliens, and find and recover the device which activated the solar flare. There will be no evac until the cause of the flare is discovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nCricket bat and ball<br/>\nB-Squad will be assigned an alternative leisure activity, cricket bat and ball. This is to be used during all assigned downtime, and combat performance measured.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntelligence Officer<br/>\nB-Squad is to protect Dr Dorian at all costs, and escort him whereever he wishes to go. (Any trooper with Dorian may take an extra wound to avoid Dorian taking a wound). Dorian has no concept of danger, and appears to be communicating with the aliens. This gives many options: Dorian is taken over by the aliens, appears to be taken over by aliens, befriends the aliens, goes mad, request that the troopers activate a device, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166425/#Comment_166425" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T05:33:10+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  5:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Revolt<br/>Orders: C-squad have had enough of the crappy rations and eaten all their combat drugs instead.

Possible follow on mission may include safeguarding a prospecting operation.<br/><br/>Infiltration: There is a powerful alien civilization on this planet, with space-faring capabilities. Your task is to go in as "ambassadors" of Terra, and try to find out the extent of their empire so that a TEF-wide assault can be coordinated to take down this possibly legitimate threat to Terra. Conflicts will need to be kept small and covert, so as not to rouse the animosity of the civilization before their full power is gauged.<br/><br/>Beachhead: You are the first unit to go in. Your mission is to locate and establish a suitable Landing Zone for the main effort of the assault. This could go many ways afterward, from the main body having a problem, to the PCs squad being put on LZ guard, or even being put at the point of the assault.<br/><br/>Rearguard: The planet is too hot for 3:16 ground forces to cleanse, so they're pulling out. You have been tasked with being the last ones off-planet, guarding the retreat and recovery of the rest of your unit. You'll be pulled out, Troopers. Command values your expertise, and wouldn't jeopardize you if it weren't absolutely necessary.

The Library and has been overrun by aliens.  The Library goes deep down in the earth and is level after level of rooms that are 40 feet high with stacks of books/DVDs/record disks.  Care must be taken not to damage other material after the first encounters (entrance), no flamethrowers, grenades, rocket launchers etc can be used.  Each character gains a 25 kill bonus if they succeed in their mission.  Kills above 1 for each PC shot are subtracted from the kill bonus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOperation Trident:   <br/>\nPlayers are assigned to locate and destroy a crashed scout vessel at the bottom of an ocean.<br/>\nTakes place on a waterworld with large piranha like fish with a huge mouth and multiple rows of teeth and the ability to generate electricity once per encounter at any range which screws with the electronics in the PC\u2019s suits causes a hit and knocks out their Fish Finder\u2019s for the rest of the mission.  The fish also have Rapid Movement.<br/>\nEquipment Issues:   The only weapons that will work under water are, Hand to Hand (knife), Power Claws, Power Blade, FlechetteGun (with the rate of fire (kills) dialed back one level to allow for the flechettes to clear the barrel due to the greater resistance of the water), RocketLauncher (with modified rocket torpedoes), Grenades (may fire from Far range if the PC set range the turn before and is considered above the target and dropping grenades down on them, depth charge style, after setting a longer delay on their timer, however the grenade goes off at the end of the round due to the time to drift down).   Visibility is murky and ends at Near however PC\u2019s are issued Sonar Detectors which attach to their helmet.  They locate objects at Far range and are called Fish Finders by the troops.   However on a Fish Finder a PC at Far cannot differentiate aliens from other PC\u2019s who are at Close and if the PC at Far fires at the aliens one of his kills is assigned to each PC at Close.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptured aliens escape containment on board the ship mid transport.  PC\u2019s wake up when the ship automatically thaws them out, groggy, naked, with sirens shrieking, and find a bloody crewman corpse in the adjacent corridor.  "Which way was the weapons locker?" (NFA roll).<br/>\n<br/>\nPiece Talks:<br/>\nPlayers are part of honor guard for a truce to be signed with an alien species (after a mission goes bad (evac) versus the same intelligent aliens).  The truce is a rouse to take out the Brigadier.  Scenario starts as an ambush if the PC with the best NFA fails his roll.  They must try and get the Brigadier and themselves off planet.  First turn is an ambush and only PC\u2019s that pass an NFA may act.  Players may use their body to take a kill for the Brigadier.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpace\u2026err\u2026Large Drifting Ship:<br/>\nPlayers\u2019 unit is assigned to sweep out a derelict alien Hulk ship in space that has been infested with parasitic aliens but which contains new technology of the original owners.  They may run into other high tech aliens who are after the same thing.  Only the second encounter can be at far range (long corridor), the rest can only be at short or close.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGuarding your Rep\u2026and Recreation:<br/>\nPlayers\u2019 are pulled out of the front line for R&amp;R and to participate in training maneuvers.  They meet up with another unit that they\u2019ve animosity with from previous missions, the third army, seventh brigade, or the \u201cLucky\u201d 3:7, who they\u2019ve grown to dislike during previous missions for impetuously attacking and leaving PCs\u2019 flank open, running away at a crucial moment, slow in advancing, etc.  Unknown to the players the 3:7 actually has the same values as the PC\u2019s.  The first encounter is a bar room brawl (players are with others of their unit).  The soldiers involved are called in to be chewed out by the Brigadier but it\u2019s pretty clear by the end that he\u2019s amused by the whole thing if they did well and that he\u2019s most upset that they came out the worse if they lost.<br/>\n\tThe second encounter is Play \u201cZ Ball\u201d where they fin out that they\u2019re playing the 3:7th. \u2013 Played in zero G with mercury filled balls that fly at odd angles.  The players see one of the 3:7th with a black eye talking to one of the officers setting up the schedule and see the officer scoot the team names around in some way, but they don\u2019t see how.  Rolls vs FA will score against the opponents, Rolls vs NFA will avoid one score by the opponents.  There are 2 halves (rounds) of play.  The brigadier talk to you and tells you that this is for the pride of the Brigade, \u201cGo Sixteen!\u201d.  <br/>\n\tThe third encounter is against an OpFor which they find out is the 3:7th, both side roll their best NFA at start and if one makes it and the other fails the encounter is at the failing team\u2019s headquarters (a great embarrassment to have it overrun).  For the scenario no permanent kills can be taken but rank can be gained through \u201ckills\u201d (miles type gear, a PC that takes a hit is \u201ckilled\u201d).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadwing" title="chadwing"><img alt="chadwing" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadwing">chadwing</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249731/#Comment_249731" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T13:53:54+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  1:53PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 2:04PM by chadwing.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With Friends Like These\u2026<br/>\nBattlefield Tech is a leading defense manufacturer.  They\u2019ve actually made some of the Expeditionary Force\u2019s equipment in the past.  Recently they bankrolled their company\u2019s future on a new line of forty foot tall bipedal vehicles (Military Expeditionary Combat Harriers), bristling with weaponry which were to make all other military systems obsolete.  The Expeditionary Force and the Terran Defense Force conducted tests but in the end turned them down.  Analysts said the company was ruined, however they moved their headquarters off Terra out to the rim and somehow managed to do well for themselves.  Now Intel says that they\u2019re actually building these vehicles for alien races (note players may have seen one on an earlier mission that wasn\u2019t powered up).  The 3:16 is now planning a mission to the headquarters of Battlefield Tech.  During the mission it should quickly become apparent that there is no easier target to spot than a forty foot tall machine walking around.  The MECH\u2019s will be taken out by fleet or heavy weapon fire support within seconds any time one appears in the distance (beyond FAR range) and is identified by one of the PC\u2019s or NPC\u2019s.  This is a backdrop to the game.  Then the PC\u2019s will have in to move to complete the mission, occasionally coming across a smoldering pairs of twenty foot tall legs surrounded by slag and debris.   The PC\u2019s will then have to deal with the aliens protecting the headquarters.  They could be body guards for the executives who are escaping or guarding evidence of alien dealings.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Be or Not To Be<br/>\nTerra Studios has sent some famous actors out to the 3:16 to get ideas for their new vid, \u201cExpeditionary Force, the Vid\u201d.  The team is assigned to show them the ropes and watch over them.   When loading on the drop ship the actors show up in costume with a film crew is along to make some promotional clips.  It becomes apparent however that they\u2019re actually shooting the vid (as well as blanks) during the current mission, using the live action/aliens as scenery and that the vid's director is among the camera crew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249736/#Comment_249736" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T14:45:56+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  2:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An officer seems to be conspiring with the aliens on the planets surface!

This information is then fed into a processor in the counter that uses a classified algorithm to award kills, which are then displayed on counter\u2019s display screen.  How the calculation is made is always a subject of conjecture and complaint by troopers but follows these general guidelines; killing a man sized alien is a kill, killing or even wounding larger aliens also awards \u201ckills\u201d although the actual individual alien may not be killed.  Similarly against smaller aliens killing more than one may be necessary to actually be awarded a \u201ckill\u201d.  In this way a trooper\u2019s actual lethality can be scored competitively with his peers even if one trooper came up against a horde of small aliens and the other just one monstrous alien.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249853/#Comment_249853" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-06T13:35:16+00:00" title="January  6, 2010  1:35PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, people.
