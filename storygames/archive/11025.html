It is in no way shape or form, even remotely a board game in any fashion at all...at all.  The question is mind boggling in its irrelevance.  I suspect the rumor of WHFRPG being a board game came from posts on the FFG forum where the idea of an RPG in a box which uses tokens to track conditions triggered "OMG its a board game!" response from 1st ed and 2nd ed grognards.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving played it, and having read the rules, it is no more a board game than any RPG you could imagine.  Its orders of magnitude less board gamey than D&amp;D; 4E.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts an RPG with streamlined character generation rules inspired by the "choose from a menu of options" method common to CRPGs.  It takes all of the "special powerz" that other games might call "feats" or the like and puts them on cards so you can always refer to the rules without flipping through a book.  It lets you track hit point damage by acquiring wound cards face down and healing by discarding the cards so you don't have to write and erase bunches of little hashmarks.  It lets you determine criticals and their effects by flipping a wound card face up so you get random criticals without needing to roll on a table.  It uses cards to represent important pieces of geography or terrain and tokens to denote range so you can move figures around abstractly without needing a map.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat elements of any of that suggests its a board game?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the original question...Comparing WHFRP to Descent is like comparing In a Wicked Age to Risk Godstorm...the only reasonable response is...wha?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244451/#Comment_244451" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T14:18:31+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  2:18PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now I know (and what's "half the battle," kids?!).<br><br>Shows how little one learns (distractedly) reading things online.<br><br>Sounds like it could be killer, then: an RPG which comes with a lot of the "accessories" to play it, unlike D&amp;D which asks you to make or buy everything else BESIDES the rules that you need to play it.<br><br>I'm gonna get back under my rock....                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244462/#Comment_244462" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T15:39:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  3:39PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like a great idea, and I'm not even the target market.

If I flipped through the book I could find the page reference where "Say Yes" is official WHFRPG3 GM instructions with Fortune dice being specifically mentioned as an easy way you can say yes to clever things players have done that would help them in the current situation and Misfortune dice being an easy way to say yes to crazy things players want to try that might have ramifications if they go wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't even mention the interplay of Boons and Banes.  Axe symbols are successes, 1 success suceeds, additional successes can buy extra oompf.  Eagles are Boons and Skulls are Banes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey combine thusly:<br/>\nSuccess with Boons is a "Yes, and in addition this other good thing also happens"<br/>\nSuccess with Banes is a "Yes, but you also suffered this other thing"<br/>\nFailure with Boons is a "No, but at least you got this other thing"<br/>\nFailure with Banes is a "No, and further more you're also screwed thusly"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe division in the game isn't really combat vs. non combat.  Its more "Encounter Mode" vs. "Story Mode" where "Encounter Mode" is combat...plus any other kind of conflict you want to resolve in a fighty-esque way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Encounter Mode the good and bad things you can do with Boons and Banes are typically spelled out on the card.  1 Axe does damage, 3 Axes does extra damage, 2 Boons knocks your opponent down, 2 Banes means you're off balance and your opponent gets a Fortune die, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in "story mode" your GM can pretty much make up how to interpret the results.  So like if you were trying to convince the king to give you a promotion he could say that 1 axe means the king doesn't refuse but doesn't make it a high priority.  2 axes means the king agrees to the promotion but there's not currently an open position to give you.  3 axes means the king makes a new position especially for you.  2 Boons means he also give you a medal, 2 Banes means the court's opinion of is you're grasping and reaching beyond your station...then you roll and the GM gives you a Misfortune die because you earlier embarrassed the duke so now he's lobbying against you with the king...but that die comes up blank so you know the king didn't pay any attention to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the basic cards all characters get in Encounter mode is "Stunt" which essentially means "do something not covered by your other cards and use story mode logic to figure out how it works".

Yeah, from following Chris's design journal it sounds like the Dragon Age TTRPG is done and just waiting approval to go to press.  I'm hoping that it manages to capture all of the information revealed through the CRPG codex and in-game dialog because I haven't found a fantasy world that hits all my buttons* as well as this one for a long time.  If it does, and can be used as a pretty complete setting book, I'll definitely get it but the rules that have been shared so far strike me as kind of meh.<br/><br/>The core die system is roll 3d6 plus an attribute +2 if you have a skill focus vs. a GM set target number.<br/><br/>Soooo, Chris reached deep into the Green Ronin bag of tricks and came up with...GURPS?  I guess after making a bazillion d20 clones GURPS seems down right refreshing, but I found myself rolling my eyes a bit when he spent a paragraph or two singing the merits of a 3d6 bell curve over a d20 linear curve.  Yay! welcome to 1985......but maybe the rest of the rules have more to recommend it.<br/><br/>I suspect the nature of having an immediate licensed tie-in required grabbing something basic and harmlessly reliable in order to turn the game design around quickly, even if it isn't all that innovative or inspirational.<br/><br/><br/>*For me that would be:<br/>1) Familiar enough to relate to (as opposed to the bizarre for the sake of being bizarre of some of the Elder Scrolls titles)<br/>2) Refreshingly different enough to not be boring (as opposed to the tedious "been there/done that"-ness of Gothic 3)<br/>3) Believable enough to actually feel like a place that could exist (as opposed to any of the Final Fantasy sillyness)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244604/#Comment_244604" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T08:53:28+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  8:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hehe...

To me the humour in Warhammer always stemmed from the absurdity of the "evil darkness" all around the Empire. Especially because the in-setting response to it was getting drunk in a pub and starting a fight. (Admittedly there's the whole "the rich are decadent and corrupted, the poor are fighting to survive and don't have the time to commit atrocities"-theme running through it, which makes me smile a lot. It's one of the main reasons why the setting appeals to me.)<br/><br/>I'm almost afraid that the new edition seems to have lost this wink of self-awareness and humour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244800/#Comment_244800" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T06:33:04+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  6:33AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 6:40AM by Valvorik.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having only cracked it open and perused, I have no idea how it plays but yes shiny.  <br/><br/>My set (purchased in Toronto) came with an additional bag of replacement d10's saying the originals weren't up to manufacturing specs.  I can see why they went with special dice, using regular dice and interpreting numbers on a table would have been painfully slow whereas, "woo hoo 3 axes, oh oh, 4 skulls" is right there staring at you.  That you sometimes have choices in how to spend your successes etc. is also very nice - it gives a level of player choice/control sometimes missing in "fortune at the end"-prone RPGs..<br/><br/>Overall I think the "choices in what the dice mean" and the variety of "yes and, yes but; no, although" results would make for more interesting play.<br/><br/>I think the tone can be a "your table" thing.  I don't see any powers, "You belch so powerfully the goblins faint." (maybe there's one in there, I was mostly reading rules not cards so far).  There's still a "snotling" reference and sometimes the artwork is a "punk dwarf with a mohawk" that isn't my thing - but I've played games where the artwork wasn't my thing before.<br/><br/>There's nods to "Say Yes", and some 'scene structure' concepts that are interesting.  Players are to author "character hooks" for adventures not the GM.<br/><br/>One thing that I was sad about similar to my sadness at breakdown of some content in D&amp;D is that the advice on how to interpret dice results narratively is in the GM book.  I like this advice espescially for encounter level play -  a success where it came from your characteristic or racial source dice is different than one coming from skill dice or pure luck dice in the fiction being created (one is your years of hunting experience lets you sneak by and the other is he bent down to tie his shoe laces and didn't see you) - I wish hints of that were in the core book's table of dice code results and that the responsibility for adding this detail to narration was the Player's.  As a GM I think I would push that across table to Player's making clear that this is where the roleplaying XP and some Fortune dice are earned or not, and as Player grab ahold of it regardless.<br/><br/>The GM-economy to add bad dice "where story needs it", drawing from monster pools and the "refresh" mechanics are also interesting.<br/><br/>If it was all well playtested, it could hum very nicely.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244965/#Comment_244965" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T17:46:01+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  5:46PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2009 10:31AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>Thanks, I admit I sort of "edit out of my thinking" things like "snotlings" and keep "skaven" etc., and yes keep anachronisms and punk-sensibiilties out of it please.

Every player rolls initiative and the GM does for each GROUP of opponents.  The number of successes determines the order that actions are performed in.  But there's a twist.  While each turn is marked with a token on the initiative track, the tokens are differentiated only by side (players vs. GM).  Not by individual characters or groups.  So just because your elvish rogue type routinely rolls the most initiative successes, that doesn't mean he's the one who always acts first...any player in the party can act on that initiative (with any disagreements/strategy discussions that aren't quickly resolved potentially earning an increase on the party tension meter.  This not only allows for some tactical stringing together of combos (by allowing players to choose which order they will act in) but also means initiative flys...the next token on the track is either a player token or a GM token...go.  None of the complicated 4E initiative tracking lists.  Plus, any initiative system that allows players to "delay" or "hold" actions pretty much means that on any round after the first the players are selecting their own turn order anyway...so why go through the rigamorole of a bunch of extra steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe monster groups are either single tougher monsters (like encounter bosses) while lesser henchment are organized into groups sized equally to the number of party characters.  The groups all act together on one initiative but only ONE of them rolls.  The others merely provide a Fortune die to the roll for their assistance.  Further, each group is a single hit point pool  e.g. 3 beast men of 5 wounds each are a pool of 15 points and every 5 points of damage fells a beast man.  So there is no need to track individual HP totals or have a lot of damage waste from over kill (10 points of damage in a single blow will kill 2 beastmen).  Monsters have Aggression / Cunning / Expertise pools which indicated the number of fortune dice the GM can freely add to their rolls in Fights / Non Fights.  The Expertise Pool means that monsters don't need to be given Skill Lists the way characters are, there is simply a pool of Expertise dice (what characters get for having higher level skills) that the GM can add to a pool for rolls that that monster would be "skilled" in (like tracking by scent for wolves or what not).  When the pools are gone, they are gone.  Also monsters get Action Cards like characters but there is only 1 copy of each Action for the entire monster side.  Some actions can be used as often as needed, but many need a "cool down" period.  So even if there are a bunch of monsters with the same ability, they can't all use it at the same time (though it recharges on each GM turn so it will recycle faster than a player action).  Further the monsters are all laid out in a two page spread that incorporates background and tactical information as well as stat blocks for several versions of the monster.  The game has a CRPG / MMORPG conceit (like 4E) in that there are several "levels" of each type of monster and rules for upgrading and down grading them.  The monsters are ranked in power relative to each other rather than relative to some default party standard which I think practically speaking is a much easier way to assemble suitable challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a whole Acts --&gt; Episodes ---&gt; Adventure ---&gt; Campaign structure with mechanisms like "Rally Phases" (similar to 4E short rests) and "Interludes" (a cross between a 4E extended rest and Mouse Guard Player Turn).  There are mechanisms for players systematically generating hooks the GM is expected to use (much like Mouse Guard "Goals") and the suggestion that the GM build various "Triggers" (i.e. if / then type branches) into the adventure.  Adventures are presumed to be largely of a branching / linear nature with the GM adjusting the branches on the fly using standard illusionist techniques, although a more sophisticated application of the text would create a more CRPG "Quest Area" type of feel.  You know how in CRPGS when you enter into a new area you can wander around freely but there are only limited interactions that mean anything (like dudes with exclamation points saying "come talk to me and accept my mission") and then fulfilling certain requirements opens up other areas and other interactions.  That's the sort of adventure construction it appears to me that the WHFRP text would support best.  There's even a little pictoral flow chart of a sample adventure that looks like it could have been taken from a CRPG graphical "Walk Through".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience system is kind of interesting in its presumptions.  The text is adamantly against awarding players differently (no Mouse Guard style MVP / work horse type of awards).  It very clearly considers such badwrongfun and recommends against it several times.  Interestingly it then goes on to provide an alternate reward system for those player specific rewards you want to hand out.  The core experience system is to hand out 1 Advance per session.  Each Career (i.e. class) has a number of available Advances (some provide lots of social skills, others provide more opportunities to increase attributes, others to get more Action cards, etc.).  Each type of improvement costs an Advance until you've purchased all of the available advances from a career you wish to, then you change careers and get a new batch of advance options.  Careers don't have a hard progression tree, but instead have an open ended tree.  Each career has a number of traits.  Changing careers costs a fair number of advances reduced by the number of traits the new and old career have in common.  So there is a progression tree if you stick to the cheapest transitions, but you have the option to save up enough Advances to jump anywhere.  This system does envision long term play (their definition of a "mini campaign" is 10 adventures) so if you're planning for shorter campaigns you would need to accelerate this if you want to see the career tracks in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only GM tool that's "missing" (and by that I mean, *I* would have liked to see it because it would have made my life easier) is a Mouse Guard style structured approach to adventure building.  While there is a structure for organizing adventures its still fairly old school in the sense of the GM needing to come up with a plot and a story arc and a bunch of characters and locations and set piece "episodes" to run.  And that's the kind of thing I don't have much time for these days.  But that's not to say one couldn't hack together a MG-esque system for generating adventure quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245065/#Comment_245065" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T07:45:12+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  7:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds pretty good.

There are a number of standard parties, don't know if they'll eventually release rules for inventing your own.  They're the fantasy equivalent of a super hero team.  The rules direct picking your party after everyone makes characters, but it strikes me that deciding what sort of party you want to be before making characters would be useful.  I haven't studied them all but the two I remember were "Gang of Thugs" and "Defenders of Justice" (or something like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nEach party sheet has 1) a couple of talent slots so that party members with the right category of talent can plug their talent into the party theirby giving all party members access to it.  2) a special party power...any member of the Defender of Justice can voluntarily take a point of Fatigue and a point of Stress to increase the damage from their attack by 1 (after calculating damage).  A useful power for putting the finishing move on someone.  and 3) a Stress Track.  The purpose of the Stress Track is to give the GM a mechanical way of saying "let's move it along and get back on track" or to reflect intercharacter rivalries.  Some of the spaces have effects when they're reached and when the last space is reached a bigger effect happens and then the track resets.  I haven't looked through to catalog all the different effect, but the ones I've seen seem to be of the "everyone takes a point of Fatigue / Stress / Wound" sort of thing, representing increasing tension in the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't seen it in action really to judge, but it didn't strike me as a wierd blunder from just reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuzz, I don't know what you're considering fundamental to D&amp;D.;  Is a fairly standard fantasy setting...party of heroes, evil monsters, kill things and take their stuff kind of game.  WH did the "points of light" style setting long before 4E picked it up.  There's a greater emphasis on investigation and rooting out internal threats (like cults) or clearing out external threats (like bands of roving beastmen) and less emphasis on underground dungeons.  Back when I played 1E we cleared a few ruins but I don't recall ever doing an actual "dungeon" adventure.  Their's a much greater sense of the characters being an actual part of a functioning society (not to the level of Storming the Wizards tower, but far greater than the usual gang of wandering psychopaths in the typical D&amp;D; game).  Combat has always been a little less attrition and a little more...one bad move and I'm dead.  Mechanically WHFRP3 bears 0 resemblance to any version of D&amp;D...perhaps; most especially 4E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245331/#Comment_245331" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T03:21:51+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  3:21AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Fuck your trad buddies Adam.

The former is roundly unfun, the second is a matter of taste. Perhaps this party tension thing is the latter's stone, being thrown at the former?<br/><br/>As in: there are players who bicker and fight and tell others what their characters should do, in the interest of "strategy". What if it was roundly unstrategic to be a jerk to fellow players? What if the game said, "such squabbling will pull you closer to mechanical consequences"?<br/><br/>It's an interesting idea.<br/>Personally, if I were GMing, and the players said, "Okay, it's PVP time!" And everyone was on board with killin' each other off... I wouldn't apply the party tension track any longer. They aren't a party any longer. I mean, it's a measure of how easy/hard it is for them to WORK TOGETHER... If/Once they started working together again, you'd better believe I'd pull in the tension track and up it a few notches, though! <br/><br/><br/>People who are more up on WHFR3, is that a valid interpretation? Does the writing support it?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245803/#Comment_245803" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T13:28:59+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  1:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, at my friend's house last night I rolled up something called a Barber-Surgeon.

There may be too many fiddly bits, though--there was a lot to look up, and each critical wound card we flipped over put some extra effect on a character. I suppose it's all in learning a new system. But I don't especially need to play this one again. I sorta leave it with a shrug.

GW owns the miniatures side of Warhammer, and I don't think they are going to want to produce prepainted minis, or even probably single minis for the RPG. They push painting &amp; converting as a significant part of the Warhammer experience. I'm kind of wondering how many minis players (the ones who otherwise be interested in roleplay) are going to want to check out WHFRP. They would seem to be a likely source for individual minis, and would probably be willing to help with painting as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_247555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/247555/#Comment_247555" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-18T16:34:35+00:00" title="December 18, 2009  4:34PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yurgh....yeah of course.

This is what I doodled up over at BWHQ earlier today or yesterday.<br/><br/>So I get the box, read it through, get excited. I get three guys together one day and we toss together some characters for a goofy monster-bash throwdown. Immediately the encumbrance rules loom to the fore: one guy wants more gear but can't carry it, another guy wants rare equipment he can't afford, they spend an hour of bullshit shopping. Mind you these are all experienced BW players; you think they'd know the score.<br/><br/>I set up some bullshit premise based on their Party Sheet and their professions, and the characters are off to defeat a big spider. It's over pretty quick. They get their XPs and spend another hour struggling with which action cards or talents or whatfuckingever to buy. They talk through every possible iteration, looking for optimal synergies with one another and the party sheet itself.<br/><br/>Next week, one guy's out but two new guys are in. We start from scratch, new characters and party sheet. Same issue, except now half the guys are more educated in how to make good choices so they're even more tuned into optimal combos and such. Again I throw some bullshit premise their way, and they get in a fight with a street gang outside a bar. I think the fight's pretty fun and tense, but one character gets beat down pretty good -- within a couple cards of their wound threshold, and stress/fatigue ran up pretty fast. From that point on, WFRP3 is now known as "the game where my trained Bounty Hunter nearly died at the hands of children." The Bounty Hunter's player now avidly avoids all conflict that doesn't look like a slam-dunk. He even gets petulant when circumstances don't allow him to create a sure-fire deathtrap ambush the next time they're faced with physical risk. Another of the players feels totally naked without some sense of his character's motives, traits, anything other than his list-of-abilities rundown.<br/><br/>It was crazy. The very infrastructure of the game totally reawakened all the old shopping, min-maxing, risk-aversion, beat-the-GM behaviors that I thought we'd left behind. Which is why I thought it'd be a fun lark, right? Take hardcore BW players and give them a fun tactical game, and that should be a gas. But no: it is entirely the wrong tactical game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253273/#Comment_253273" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:48:34+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your criticisms are definitely fair.  We avoided the bullshit premise by creating Beliefs.  We basically are playing WFRP with a BW mindset.  The game is deadly but I think it's a bit less lethal than BW.  It's actually a bit difficulty to actually die (not difficult to pass out, however). <br/><br/>Encumbrance is also tough but realistic.  It's easy enough to hand-waive if you don't want to focus on it.  We had an Elf with 2 strength who couldn't carry anything really until he re-worked his strength to 3.<br/><br/>All this stuff definitely puts the onus on the group to maintain a story-game mindset and ignore the gamist/sim incoherence.  A decent portion of our fun is despite the system, but with that being said we are having a large amount of fun with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253277/#Comment_253277" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T14:53:46+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  2:53PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sure does.

"Story mode" appears to exist only to push everyone into "encounter mode," which is (mostly) shorthand for combat. Yes yes, you can and should use encounter mode for social stuff and any other time where the stress/fatigue economies might come into play, but again -- no actual support in the game for it. They gave us Progress Trackers and some vague ideas about how to use them, but that was it.<br/><br/>When the lead hitters in the game hunkered down and staunchly refused to engage in combat, they therefore refused to engage in encounter mode...leaving us with story mode, an unsupported mode of play.

The 2nd point you make about story mode appears to be a not-uncommon reaction at this point - if the first reaction to game was "great game mechanics/potential, rules poorly edited/expressed" then the 2nd wave seems to be "the whole story - encounter matrix is poorly worked through, the social type of encounter as opposed to combat encounter poorly defined/supported, how certain things work in story mode unclear - it can be worked out/handled but that's left to each game table to sort".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253381/#Comment_253381" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T05:59:05+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  5:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I think its clear that WHFRPG3 was hugely influenced by story game design.  But that's a far cry from saying it IS a story game.  Its built on a very traditional chassis, and the seperation of Story Mode from Encounter mode, while sophisticated for a game of its type, is still very much a traditional seperation.  I suspect if you posed the issue to the designers you'd get a blank look and a reply of "of COURSE the story mode isn't as worked out as combat...there are only a limited number of things you can do in combat, but story mode can be ANYTHING...of course each game table needs to work it out for themselves...how else would it happen?"  And I suspect, most RPers out there would agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253413/#Comment_253413" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T08:44:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  8:44AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I totally get where the rest of the RPing culture is on this point.
