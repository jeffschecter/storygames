What was your thinking behind the sections that you did include - Gods, Tokens, Resources - and the sections that you didn't include (a list of actual Celtic deities and their domains and awesome magics; more detail of Common Enemies and Land Troubles are two that stood out as potential room for expansion).<br/><br/>I guess why I'm asking these questions is that at no point in Guns &amp; Glammer did I say, "Ah, it's now clear to me why I'd want to play a game that takes the form of a Western but with Celtic trappings". I never got to that point with "Ghost Lines" either (another John Harper game), so you're in good company, but it's the gaping hole in Guns &amp; Glammer for me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440963/#Comment_440963" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-19T05:18:05+00:00" title="December 19, 2014  5:18AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *checks under the desk for listening devices* *checks computer for worms* Uh.

I was talking about it in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23rpgnet&amp;Mode=like">#rpgnet</a> on IRC Magicstar server, were you there, spying on me? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <br/><br/>More seriously, I started making notes after the idea spawned from examining another rpg's game art and a stray comment by Dan Davenport made me run off on this tangent. I'm not familiar with Lasers and Feelings, but cool! I think the idea needs some love.

For the moment, i've syntethized the most important things to me in the celtic matter: Geas, evil witches, god rulers and their relics, and the importance of being heroes and kill evil monsters and invaders. Anyhow, im sure im leaving important things behind, please everybody remind them to me if you got them. <br/>I think i know what you mean by the "no point in this".

The Druids and Skalds of the West wander the lands of men, teaching, learning, fighting men, fomor, and things conjured by the firbolg.

The combination of the familiar (the Western, in this case) and the exciting (the Celtic tribes) also appears in steampunk (familiar Victoriana, exciting cogs), so you might be on to a winner here. <br/><br/>But I think there's a mutually beneficial relationship between Victoriana and steamtech that I'm not seeing (yet) with guns and Celts. Science fiction arose in the Victorian era, and so giving fantastical devices a 19th century patina fits some of our unconscious expectations. You can get away with a gyrocopter if its pilot has a top hat and monocle. <br/><br/>Are there similar synergies in G&amp;G? Silverlion's comment about "The Druids and Skalds of the West wander the lands of men, teaching, learning, fighting men, fomor, and things conjured by the firbolg" makes me wonder if there are legendary Celtic figures that are like cowboys and gunslingers. If so, I think that could be the "hook" that lowers the suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>For example, to quote from Wikipedia:\n<blockquote>Western gunslinger heroes are often local lawmen or enforcement officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, a nomadic loner, or a skilled fast-draw artist. [...] They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering from place to place with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving certain individuals and communities from them in terms of chivalry. </blockquote>\nWhat if G&amp;G focused on brehons or members of fianna - who also wandered from place to place, often facing curious and hostile enemies, had a code of chivalry, and so on? This could be the hook that justifies the guns and showdowns and posses and slow-talking people with no name. "Fianna were a lot like posses of cowboys, so let's have them shoot formorians with revolvers" feels right to me, or at least seems like it's on the right track to feel right.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440996/#Comment_440996" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-21T18:09:36+00:00" title="December 21, 2014  6:09PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It totally helps, and im gonna work on that; thank you! <br/><br/>the idea for the game came to me from comparing Cuchulainn and his friends with gunslingers; and from the Dark Tower novels (where the gunslingers are descendants of King Arthur's knights). It was very clear in my head, but maybe i didn't conveyed it to the game. I should add a chivalry code to it, or maybe the means for the players to make their own code. I never heard about brehons or members of fianna until now; im googling it to find some inspiration. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440997/#Comment_440997" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-21T19:52:28+00:00" title="December 21, 2014  7:52PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Three mottos of the fianna make a good code:<br/><br/>Glaine \xe1r g-cro\xed (Purity of our hearts) <br/>Neart \xe1r n-g\xe9ag (Strength of our limbs) <br/>Beart de r\xe9ir \xe1r m-briathar (Action to match our speech) <br/><br/>the using of the Diord Fionn (the hunting horn) as a warcry also looks like something i should keep                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441006/#Comment_441006" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-23T03:06:51+00:00" title="December 23, 2014  3:06AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome stuff!
