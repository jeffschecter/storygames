This is my attempt at an Actual Play report, and its my first Actual Play, so be gentle <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Hopefully Per and Gregor will come in and put me right if I get anything wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll try to outline the game in this post, and then comment on difficulties and mechanical insights in the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Pre-game</b><br/>\n<br/>\nVictoria, Per and Gregor took the characters from the previous playtest we had (two of which appear in the ashcan rules). Per was playing Marty Stardust, a wannabe rock star with a fear of failure, Gregor took Major Barty Wetherspoon, who yearns after a quiet and perfect middle england and fears grittiness and unkindness (both of these are in the ashcan), while Victoria was playing Tamera, who believes herself to be the chosen reincarnation of Horus, and Pharaoh of the Egyptian gods and fears furries (and her catholic guilt). Justin brought a new character (and seems to have taken away the character sheet) for John Gunn, a black-ops style operative for the mysterious company with enemies amongst his own superiors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also assumed, as suggested in Carl C's playtest, that the PC's knew each other before. Finally each player got 5 infestation (we used blue glass chips) and I got 10 shadow tokens (red glass chips). I also had a pad of paper ready to tear up and use as tears.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Opening Scene - Marty's caravan</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe session opened in the trailer home of Marty, which Per decided was in the garden of his sick mother's house. When the post arrived it contained a letter from a fan (Cathy marsh) asking Marty to autograph his latest CD (also enclosed). This was strange, because Marty had never released such a CD! Looking over the CD Marty found an address for "Pike Brothers Records" at 218 Brick Lane, but no other contact details.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point both the Major and Tamera narrated themselves into the scene (this only had a difficulty of 3, so it wasn't hard). Tamera turned out to be staying next door and was having her mail delivered to Marty, the Major had popped down to make a cup of tea. The Major overshot on his change, so I narrated that he wasn't just round to help, he'd actually offered to take on the job of looking after Marty's sick mother, and had to get back to the house at any moment. Marty meanwhile decided to open Tamera's mail, and since Victoria had got a perfect change to add the mail in the first place she got to narrate the contents, which turned out to be an angry mummified crocodile!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty went back to the house and looked up Pike Brothers in the phone book and gave them a call, but got an answering machine and a strange message of a young woman's voice saying "help me!". Being disorganized and confused by technology he left a message anyway. Meanwhile Marty called Cathy's house and was told by her flatmate that she had gone out that morning to the East End (where Brick Lane was), and hadn't come back. Marty and Tamera, in an attempt to get more information from the flatmate, constructed a company, Stardust Productions, out of thin air, with Tamera as co-owner and some Polish callcenter workers in the back of the mobile home. They didn't get more information, but they did get the flatmate's credit card details. (Here Per didn't have the obsessions for the change he wanted but Victoria helped out to get a share of the change).<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally (this scene took half the game) John Gunn turned up with a writ from Pike Brothers ordering them to cease and desist with their illegal distribution of CDs! When he realised that the people with the CD were his fellow Solipsists they all deduced that something strange was going on over at Pike Brothers. Tamera played the CD, which had weird tracks on it. Track 3 especially had the voice of a young woman saying "I can't get out" over and over again, although when she replayed it she got lift music instead and a voice saying "doors opening, level 5". Marty recognized the voice as being the same as the one on the answer phone, and they deduced that it was the missing Cathy. Together they decided to head to Brick lane.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100971/#Comment_100971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T04:11:39+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene Two - Brick lane</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBrick lane proved to be a run down street of battered cars and shops with grills over the windows. Pike Brother's records was a converted warehouse with shuttered windows and a locked door, looking abandoned. However John Gunn proved to have the key (this was an easy change, especially as Justin had already established that he worked here) and they entered an empty lobby with the answering machine from earlier. There was also a list of employees on the wall, with Mister Pike (5C) at the top. At this point the Shadow intervened and tried to remove Gunn from the company. His name was struck off the list along with a note to the secretary to say he'd resigned and should be kicked out. This un-change had a strength of 8 (I decided to use less than the full shadow strength), but with the Major's aid this was easily resisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nGunn now had it in for Pike, and was all for going straight to 5C. Tamera meanwhile searched for more information and found a computer that would only show static, a record catalogue that didn't include Marty's CD, and a printed out schedule that showed Mr Pike had a meeting with Cathy at 10:30am. The Major surmised that both Cathy and the CD were threads that needed to be dealt with to undo this shadow incursion, one to be found, the other removed, but they left the CD intact for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Three - On the way to 5C</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Solipsists now tried to make their way to 5C. The Major insisted on taking the stairs, which led them to level 2 (a cubicle farm) and level 3, where packing boxes of flat-pack furniture were stacked up. These had labels saying they were being delivered next week, and were from PIKEA (and addressed to Mr Pike). Gunn leapt on this as evidence of Mr Pike's treachery against the company, and rang through to his bosses for authorisation to remove him. (This change had a little bit of a discussion, since it wasn't clear what Justin actually hoped to achieve with it, but it became clear that it was authorisation to use force to get rid of Pike).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Solipsists continued up the stairs, but ended up on floor 3 again. A third try and the same result. At this point Marty and Tamera insisted that only the lift would work, while the Major and Gunn investigated the fire escape. The others insisted that the Major would, in fact, go in the lift (they persuaded him rather than changing things) but Gunn stuck to the lift. At this point the party split up. Gunn went to the fire escape and, finding it blocked, headed to the street, where he created a car with Mr Pike in it arriving (again an easy change, but one he overshot). Pike turned up but with meanacing wetwork style bodyguards. Gunn refused to tangle with these but used his new authorisation to call in the "Phoenix security". Meanwhile the rest used the lift to get to level 5 (which required another change they all worked on together).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Four - Fith Floor</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMarty, Tamera and the Major reached the plush floor 5 to confront Mr Pike, but the Shadows attacked the Major, trapping him in the lift. It plunged down the shaft and all he could get on the emergency phone was the sound of Cathy being tortured and calling for help. This un-change had a strength of 10 (9 points left and a limitation of 1 being triggered) but the Major blew most of his infestation resisting and got out on level 3, where he had a cup of tea. I spent 2 shadow token for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile Marty and Tamera entered 5C and found Mr Pike, a record exec with a fish head, who told them Marty was fired and Tamera hired in his place! Marty was attacked by snakes in suits (record company lawyers), who mocked the lift music on his album, while Tamera was swamped by her furry suit weraing backing singers. At this point Justin tried to have Gunn and his hit men arrive as well. I did Justin's change first, and spent a couple of shadow tokens to make the change more difficult. With that and his own limitation of unreliable minions the change failed and I narrated that Gunn was stuck downstairs tyring to fill in paperwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis left a Shadow strength of 5 for the two un-changes, with level 2 limitations being triggered both times. Tamera resisted perfectly and had her mummy crocodile eat the furries, while Marty overshot and had the lawyers offer him a new lifetime contract instead. I narrated that they took him off to 5B to offer him a contract with a glass of JD. This reduced the shadow to 2 tokens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100972/#Comment_100972" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T04:11:55+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Scene Five - Closing Scene</b><br/>\n<br/>\nReturning from floor 3 the Major reasoned that the evil record execs. couldn't <i>really</i> want to harm poor Cathy, and that she was probably locked in a cupboard somewhere asking for help on the intercom, and she would really appreciate it if someone were to let her out and give her a cup of tea. (Gregor tried hard here <i>not</i> to use his 'making tea' obsession, because he knew he would overshoot, but the others talked him into it, and he did indeed overshoot by a large margin). I narrated that he did indeed find Cathy, waiting in a comfortable waiting room reading "town and garden" and making tea in a tea urn. It turned out that she had recorded a few odd clips for the record company earlier (like 'help me') but was now just waiting for a tour. What's more her mother lived in the same village as the Major and was the nice woman across the road! The two of them went off to go on the tour with the nice secretary who was missing before. I spent another shadow token for the resolved thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis left Tamera dealing with Pike alone, but with the shadow now reduced to 1 token (a total difficulty of 6) she easily dealt with him by summoning Osiris, God of the dead and traditional enemy of fishes (because a fish ate Osiris' private parts after he'd been chopped up by Set) to smite him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGunn finally arrived to clear up at this point, only to be confronted by the <i>other</i> Pike brother and his bodyguards emerging from the lift. This Mr Pike trash-talked Gunn's messy handling of the situation and threatened to take the company off him, but Gunn simply shot him, reasoning that as the only Mr Pike left around his authorisation from the company applied to him. Mr Pike's bodyguards took the hint and left.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis left only one thread over, the CD, which was now the foundation of Marty's new record contract. Gregor argued that it had to go, though Marty was somewhat reluctant, as was Tamera, since she co-owned Stardust Productions, which was now merging with Pike Brother's Records. However Justin pointed out that it had already been established that the CD was a fake earlier, and with the obsessions and infestation of all four players helping to overcome Marty's obsessions they wrote the CD off as a bad chinese import fake, complete with details of the wikipedia entries and snopes pages on the legendary 'Chinese Album'. With that the final shadow token was gone and the shadow was defeated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew ... what a lot of text <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'll talk about conclusions in the next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100973/#Comment_100973" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T04:12:43+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what did I learn from our game? The first was that Solipsist is a very confusing and ever shifting game, but that this isn't a bad thing. The second is that there are certainly still some wrinkles in the mechanics, which *is* a bad thing, but can be fixed <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(1) Tears</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem was the gaining of tears ... no one got any! In Carl C's game he said players did gain them, because they wanted loads of infestation, but there were never enough to feel like any sort of danger to them. In this game players were much more cautious and aimed for perfect changes. There were very very few failures or overshoots and there were no tears at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nPer put it rightly, the threat of running off into your own world is supposed to be everpresent, and it wasn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolutions to this were bandied about and we seem to have settled on these<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;ol&gt;<br/>\n&lt;li&gt;You gain a Tear every time you overshoot ... this will give more Tears and also be much easier to track<br/>\n&lt;li&gt;You gain a Tear if you satisfy an obsession through a change, even if you didn't overshoot to do it<br/>\n&lt;/ol&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis rule would have given (I think) Tamera no Tears, Gunn 1 (or 2, depending on how much power he'd gained), Marty 2 and the Major 3, which would have been much more like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(2) Fighting Shadow</b><br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally the shadow rules worked fine, but there were not enough tokens. I'd picked 10 for 3 players, so I should have upped it for 4. However they need additions, because some of the things we did in play (like having a higher shadow strength for Mr Pike) are not in the rules. The best addition will be tying certain tokens to threads, and removing the tokens only when the threads are dealt with. The more threads the more non-confrontational ways there are of removing the shadow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpending shadow tokens to raise difficulty was very inefficient, and spending 2 to stymie Gunn really weakened the un-changes on Marty and Tamera too much. Maybe 2 points for each token?<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting 4 infestation for perfectly resisting an un-change was a BAD IDEA! It made even the hardest un-change cheap to resist. I think removing a tear or un-tick would be a much better reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(3) Making changes</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIt was generally easy for players to make changes, they had no fear of doing so, and of course wild things came as easy as simple ones. I think Carl's suggestion of the +1 or +2 difficulty for the 'special effects' definitely gets written in to the sidebar. Oddly the less consequential changes (story wise) had wilder effects. Almost no change failed, and most were perfect, probably because infestation was not being run out (see above). I think changes to handling tears would reign this in a touch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(4) Character design</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJustin had a lot of trouble with his character, probably because he made his character in isolation. His biggest problem was that narrow focussed obsessions (like 'gaining power within the order') were a lot weaker in play than broad, but similar, ones (like 'gaining power') which made it harder to do things. He felt that there should be more guildelines on writing obsessions, as there now are on limitations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(5) Solipsist interaction</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn general it seemed pretty easy for Solipsists to aid each other, but much harder to oppose them, because you had to find a limitation that applied, and it often wouldn't. Justin, for example, wanted to get rid of the zombie crocodile, because it didn't fit his world view, but had no tools to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur suggestion was a modification of the "yes, and ..." technique. To remove an element you don't like make a change that introduces a new scene in which that element is missing, rather than attacking it directly. This is more of a technique than a mechanic, and should be there as advice maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore generally other Solipsist's limitations seldom held changes back even when they were present, which is not quite how it is supposed to work, especially because they could always choose to help instead and then ignore a limitation. It might be reasonable to add a +1 difficulty for other solipists being around, on top of limitiations? Of course that makes co-operation hard, which is also less than ideal!<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(6) Story design</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe players messed with my plot something rotten! This was not unexpected, but it was interesting to see that it was as true as I was expecting. Especially bad was Justin adding himself to the Pike Brothers company, which involved him with the shadows, and then trying to make the shadow attack all about his world view instead. At times I felt I was fighting with him for the plot, which was probably bad on my part.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Justin was playing the "it's all about me" to the hilt, and making the story about his concerns in a way the other players weren't. I am not sure if that was a good thing or not, but mechanically there was no consequence for it. I'd like it to be that a player who grabs the story and makes it all about his vision gets closer to achieving that vision and more in danger of vanishing, but that didn't happen. Changing the rules on tears would have helped that, but not enough, since Gunn ended up with less than the Major, who didn't make the story about him (although there was lots of tea and human kindness).<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain suggestions welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>(7) Tears</b><br/>\n<br/>\nFractures just didn't sound right. Maybe it's because we had older versions of the rules lying around? Maybe it's because I thought it would be cool to have torn bits of paper as tears ... eitehr way I just liked Tear better, even if it *is* misread! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101074/#Comment_101074" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T11:07:26+00:00" title="October  4, 2007 11:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) I would say that a Tear every time you overshoot is about right.

At most, just include things that highlight the problems with the narrative. Frankly, I'm not even going to read anything but your last post. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, what version of the rules is this? I can't be sure that mine is up to date. Also, have you considered publishing them so that other people can comment more cogently? <br>\n<br>\nOn to your points:<br>\n1) I agree with Carl's agreement. It also simplifies things, in addition to making Tears more common. <br>\n2) Same here, it's good. It's not only mechanically sound, but thematically it seems to make sense. The character is reparing damage caused by the shadows, which repairs damage he's caused, too. <br>\n3) I'm not seeing how you're addressing the failure issue, which is, I think the worst problem. I'm not seeing much reason for the character to ever fail. On the other hand... you might want to consider taking failure off the table. The results are "Change, with no Tear" or "Change with Tear." Basically resolution in this case isn't about making changes, but about how much it costs to do so. Which is pretty cool. <br>\n4)-6) I think that you should put some rules in to address this problem, yes. But I think that the way to do it is to look at narrativism producing techniques (grabby r-maps and such), and see if you can't implement such from there. For instance, if more than one of the Solopsist's care about a single NPC, that's a good start right there. Basically the question "Why are these solopsists in contact with each other in this story?" should be answered (even if only in terms of potential connections, if not actual) during chargen. <br>\n7) At the risk of sounding pretentious, you could use a phonetic neologism like Tayrs?<br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101135/#Comment_101135" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T14:31:52+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  2:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David<br><br>I felt that it was unclear at times over who had narration and what that entailed, maybe we skipped to quickly to an outcome once the result was see without actually formalising the change. We did formalise this occasionally, I can recall Justin clarifying exactly what he wanted to happen and this is good. I think some advice for the GM to keep in mind the rules for who approves the change and to make sure that it happens.<br><br>We didn't really fail did we? There were a couple of failures out of the many changes we tried but they were only minor inconveniences in the story since there was no penalty to failure, save some limitations being ticked. There wasn't a failing outcome for us, as we could just get someone else to try a different change on the same problem. I really feel that when we try something it should not be trivial -- something needs to hang on the outcome. I like Mike's idea of something is going to change. Perhaps the animacules of accepted reality bite down hard and enforce an outcome when we fail?<br><br>I really think Justin's issues would have been solved by creating the character in the group, and things like relationship maps and scribbling down ties between us and shared NPCs would give a "group" focus. I still feel the danger is that everyone will want to be their own Wolverine, ever forgetting that even Wolverine is part of a team.<br><br>I agree we should have seen more Tears. In some ways the Major wasn't tearing reality (like the mummified walking crocodile was) but he WAS tearing himself from reality. That's the way it needs to be explained.<br><br>Tayrs might not be too bad if you can put up with it? Tears did feel better than Fractures having played through some more game. How about Rips, with RIP if you go to your own little world?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101193/#Comment_101193" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T01:13:31+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  1:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2007 4:15AM by Hituro.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh Mike, harsh! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I did say I'd never done this before. Sure there may have been a bit too much narrative but  I wouldn't personally touch an Actual Play without some notion of narrative with a barge pole. Surely the mechanics are there to support narrative, without narrative of a game the mechanical comments are out of context?<br/>\n<br/>\n4-6) Anyway, as you say Gregor, having Justin develop his character with everyone else would have gone a long way towards easing the interactions. I don't want to say 'problem' because I'm sure it was more a challenge than a problem. We still played, it was still fun, it was just more confusing that way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> We did start off by saying that all the characters knew that they were solipsists and knew each other, but Justin seemed to forget that, hence his approach to the others being confrontational.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) According to the strict letter of the rules the GM narrates the consequences of a failure, but the failure has no additional mechanical implications beyond ticking limitations. I suggested before that failure should cost infestation, or, more likely, give you a tear (so any change without a perfect result costs a tear) but everyone who commented was very much against that at the time. However the rules say that "failing a change shatters the solipsist's vision, snapping them back painfully to consensus reality". Clearly we were not capturing that feel. I can certainly see how that would cause a Tear (because you shy away into your own reality in consequence), but that just makes failing a lot like succeeding!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think ticking limitations *is* a penalty, but it is also good, because it protects you from Tears! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I guess there is no real failure here other than being un-changed by the shadows!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure about all changes being non-trivial though. There were a lot of changes people were making for fun, adding in the marketing company, or the callcenter, things which didn't have big stakes. If making a change is the equivalent of using a skill then some skill uses were more consequential than others. Does there need to be a mechanical change which emphasizes some sorts of changes over others? Perhaps there is more consequence for failing when the Shadow is involved? E.g. you get un-ticks instead of ticks when failing a change versus the Shadow?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Totally agreed Carl, I had the same thought later. Remove an un-tick or, failing that, a Tear.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Carl, the reason for having a Tear for satisfying an obsession is basically because obsessions are, by definition, things that if they came true would be bringing you closer to your own vision world and further from consensus. It proved possible in play to satisfy obsessions while only making perfect changes, and thus never getting any tears, so that you could in theory achieve your vision without a single change. By giving out a tear whenever an obsession is satisfied fully it models your progress to your own world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn grounding you would sacrifice the thing that satisfied the obsession to remove the tear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if that's all a bit out of order there with the replies                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101199/#Comment_101199" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T04:14:01+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  4:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Also, what version of the rules is this?

That is you could play the concept, and just go "freeform." The only thing that we can discuss in terms of your design is what your rules do. So, yes, to the extent that it's important to how the rule was used, you want to include that narration. Like I said.<br>\n<br>\nBut otherwise the only thing I can see the narrative laid out for is to entertain readers. The only problem with that is that RPG narratives are dull as hell. They're fun to play, not to read. That's my opinion, to some extent, but I have a theory as to why that's pretty generally true. <br>\n<br>\nIn fact, I'll go so far as to say that I'm somewhat anti-narration. I'm pro-narrative, but narration is too often sought after as the point of RPG play, when I think it's actually in the way much of the time. But that's another tangent. <br>\n<br>\nIn point of fact, what you have isn't even an account of play, it's a constructed narration of a story that is what your mind has reconstructed from play after the fact. You wrote, "Marty went back to the house..." but what really happened is that some player said, "I go back to the house" or something. Right? <br>\n<br>\nIt's actually an impediment to understanding what happened in play to have this sort of reconstructed narration of the events of play. <br>\n<br>\nSomebody out there will vehemently disagree with me, I'm sure. But that's not the point of this thread, and if somebody does want to discuss it, please start a new thread, and let's not slow this one down. It'll have to suffice here for it to be my advice that less (far, far, far less) is more in terms of narration and such.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOn the subject of Justin being confrontational, and this seeming to be a problem... I'd say that the PCs will be, by far in this game, the most interesting opposition to each other. Every game I run has the potential for the PCs to as much as kill each other. And everybody loves it. <br>\n<br>\nThe point is that there are ways to play where character conflict is player collaboration. And I'd recommend you investigate this sort of play and how to facilitate it. Yeah, I have nothing against everyone making characters together, and getting to understand what each player likes about their character. But even then play could end up with 4 different stories about 4 different characters. There are ways to make it more likely that the player's stories cross. <br>\n<br>\nAs simple one - not one I like, but one that's good for demonstration - is the team structure. Where these Solopsists have all been brought together to fight the shadows on missions. Yeah, I hate the idea, too. But it would work to solve this particular problem, right? There are loads of ways that you can reinforce these things. <br>\n<br>\nYes, you can leave it to the players. That'll work some unknown percentage of the time. I'd prefer to see more support. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAll that point 3 stuff... I think I'd have to see it in actual play to really comment more. You've seen it up close. Go with your gut, and playtest again. <br>\n<br>\nOne thing there that's probably obvious, but I'll mention it anyway, is to watch out for structural problems in terms of the size of the obsessions.

Or maybe it has all been said elsewhere already, and I just handled it badly. I know I have seen discussion of retelling versus actual accounts of games elsewhere, so I suspect the advice is out there already. I'll leave it to you to start another thread if you think it is warranted. I'll just accept, for now, that I didn't do this AP as well as I could and move on, if that's okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Re: opposition</b> I totally agree that the most interesting opposition available in solipsist is from other players. Indeed you explained to me in email a while back why you didn't like the shadows at all, and we talked about the other sorts of games you could play, revolving around inter solipsist conflicts and emotional troubles. These games would be wonderful too. The problem here was that there was not inter-player or inter-character opposition going on, rather it was Justin against the plot, or against everyone else. Every time the rest of the characters found a clue to help them fight the shadow, Justin made it something about his own story arc instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'm not saying that this was wrong, but it was hard to play with. Maybe I should / could have run with it more. Maybe this is how you fight the Shadow, by turning it into your own story so that it vanishes into your vision, which is a nice metaphor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Re: values of traits</b> This was no problem in play. Traits change quite frequently, and you are getting to both add and subtract, so its pretty easy to get any number. Even if all your traits end up even you are still only a point of infestation away from an odd number, so its no trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101713/#Comment_101713" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T15:13:54+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  3:13PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2007 3:14PM by Hituro.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>I'm actually in agreement with you Mike on this point about write ups.

Does that make sense? If the Shadow, or someone else, doesn't oppose then all the pre-written stuff can go right out the window, on the whim of a PC. I don't think that's a bad thing, after all we'd be rationalising ourselves how all this stuff (missing girl, strange letter, CD that doesn't exist) came about.

Why did I say Greggor? I don't know, I honestly don't know. Must be losing it. :-)<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the AP post, you didn't do anything that almost every poster does when first doing this. I'm sure that I did somewhere way back. And, yeah, this principle I'm talking about isn't something that Ron and others haven't propounded previously. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nI don't dislike the Shadows. I think they're a neat idea that can stay. I tried to explain what I mean previously. I think they make a good tool for the GM, a way to pressurize situations and such. What I think they should not be used for is to create a plot, especially not a plot where it's all about finding the Shadows and eliminating them. Because that's dull. Sounds like some weak version of (the already somwhat weak) Whispering Vault. <br>\n<br>\nFor instance, let's say that you have two PCs, one who cares (mechanically) about NPC A, and the other cares about NPC B. A simple scenario is that the shadow has formed as a monster who is terrorizing both, and it's escallating, threatening to kill them. In this case, there's only one course of action for the PCs... track down the shadow and kill it. Play becomes about that, and that only. <br>\n<br>\nAnd this assumes that the scenario was even designed to take the PCs into account at all (many times, scenarii are created in a vaccuum, such that the GM has to tack on character motivation after the fact as "hooks" or simply ignores it altogether). <br>\n<br>\nNow, if instead you have it that the shadow has tempted NPC A, and NPC A has succumbed and is terrorizing NPC B, now we have a situation where there are choices that have to be made. The PCs are potentially brought into conflict, but only depending on what choices the player makes for them. The play becomes less about just hunting down the shadows, but the interpersonal relationships between the characters, and how they respond to those relationships being pressured. <br>\n<br>\nSo a very subtle and simple change in scenario design, and you suddenly have what I'm looking for. <br>\n<br>\nNow, you can leave this all to technique and scenario design if you like, allowing as most games to do, for the technique that the GM knows to drive the sort of play that occurs. The problem is that few people know the technique that I give an example of above (simple though it may be). In fact, "experienced players" will avoid that sort of situation like the plague. Worse, if they did do a situation like that, it's possible that the game could degenerate into "PVP." Which would likely be catastrophic in this game (which is why they intelligently avoid this sort of situation). <br>\n<br>\nWhich is why I'm suggesting that you incorporate in the design some method of informinng players mechanically that they're working together as players, even if their characters are working against each other. More generally that they can approach their characters from the point of view of making up plot as they go, rather than just trying to track down the GM's plot. <br>\n<br>\nNow, that's easier for me to propose than it is for you to create the mechanisms that create this effect. But it's something to think about. Unless you're dead-set on the mission structure. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's interesting is that I would enjoy the sort of play that Justin was creating. It's only "hard" if you have some pre-generated plot that you're trying to stick to. Because each time the player modifies the world substantially, it might require you to alter the plot so that it's still pertinent. <br>\n<br>\nSo just don't have a plot. Instead, follow the player's lead. If they change the world in X way, look at that change, and figure out what you can now inject (using shadows, NPCs, environment, whatever), to create a new problem for the PC. "Problem" here meaning some choice that they have to make, largely in terms of whether or not to alter the world, and how much. <br>\n<br>\nAs an illustration of a mechanic that could drive this in theory - and here again, I'm using an intentionally bad example meant just to explicate the point - you could roll randomly against the PCs traits to see which one to pressure next, after each change. For instance, the PC has just changed the world so that everyone thinks he's a rock star, and you roll, and his obsession about guns comes up randomly. So you decide that at the post-show party a guy shows up waving a gun around, and generally posing a danger to the groupies, roadies and other band-members, etc. When confronted he becomes beligerent and starts pointing the gun at people. Does the PC create a gun to deal with the situation, indulging his obsession? <br>\n<br>\nAgain, not a great example of a mechanic (I'm sure you can do better), but you can see how this mechanic would make it so that the play would not be about some pre-generated plot, but about an evolving plot based on the PCs actions. The situation in question only comes about because, and in response to, the player making up the band, roadies, groupies, etc. <br>\n<br>\nThen, if you really want to tighten things, you create mechanics that do things like causing "crosses" where the it requires elements to be brought into play that involve more than one PC, such that it intertwines the PCs. Reward systems can be used here. For example, you could have it such that a player can erase a Tear if they cause a change to occur that brings another PC into play (the rationale is something about how the extra infestation from the other PC erases the damage caused by the first PC or something). <br>\n<br/>\nIn this way you incentivize the players to be mixing their stories together, so that as they drive play, they don't just go off in all different directions. Make the other PCs important to every player mechanically, and you'll never have this problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this way, you avoid the "problems" that Greggor mentions above, with players developing various ways to play, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101882/#Comment_101882" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T07:23:51+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  7:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Mike, there is a load of food for thought there!<br/><br/>I totally agree with ... well ... I think its everything. I had this mission structure written down, because that's the sort of game preparation I'm familiar with, and I knew I needed to prepare something, because I was running a playtest damm it and I owed it to the players not to have come to the table with no ideas. I can see now that I did the wrong sort of preparation, but that's cool, because it helps me learn, and because I know that the game will need advice about preparation for the GM (which i could have used myself).<br/><br/>So the question then becomes can I coherently write that advice (it is what I should work on next I think, since the system, with the tweaks above appears to work fine) when I had trouble doing it myself! And can I work in the structure of Shadow opposition (tokens, threads, un-changes) into that sort of model. I hope so, because I like them, and the un-change rules already include methods for the shadow to attack limitations, maybe I need a way for them to attack obsessions too. Also I should change references to "places where the shadow is strong" to "scenes where the shadow is strong".<br/><br/>Hopefully I can post some text here when I am done and get some critique                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102143/#Comment_102143" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T23:34:39+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Wayne in this playtest. I have been muling over my feedback for too long, for two reasons: firstly, I haven't been home and online like I use to, and therefore haven't been up to speed with, say, Story Games. Secondly because I didn't particularly enjoy the play experience, for various reasons.<br/><br/>I was interested in Solipsist because one of my old heartbreakers is Mage (1st ed). Mage was an excellent idea at the time, poorly executed and pretty much unplayable as written. Solipsist could be Mage done better, and I read an earlier playtest version (v3 or 4 I think), which didn't put me off the game at all.<br/><br/>These days I try to play Story Now games - I've found that these games give me a lot of pleasure in a fraction of the time a "trad" rpg would - simple as that. I'll play anything where somebody hasn't written the story my character is going to explore, really.<br/><br/>That's where the trouble with the Pike Bros playtest started for me. Taken as a whole, the session felt very much like one of the sessions in the old days, for me before 2003, that almost killed of my interest in roleplaying. There was endless arguing about details, players looked increasingly bored around the table (especially me and David's wife, who was sitting to the left of me and grew quieter during the game and started scribbling figures and patterns on a piece of paper.) Plus David was nervous, of course, we were testing his baby, why shouldn't he be, and I wanted to test the game, not impose my personal preferences on it.<br/><br/>David comes from the mainstream or traditional side of gaming, and he naturally saw Solipsist as a "normal" game with a "normal" split between GM and players.<br/><br/>Anyway, David had a story in mind, and that felt stifled to me - I didn't feel my choices as a player really meant something - I didn't get to explore Wayne except in the light of the prepared plot. I managed to establish that he lived in a mobile home at the end of his old mother's garden, but from then on I felt squeezed into a plot line.<br/><br/>Is the GM-prepared plot inherent in the game? It kind of was in the version we playtested (v5), where there is advice to the GM how to do exactly that.<br/><br/>The single core mechanic of Solipsist - being able to change reality almost at will - is still a powerful one, IMO.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102146/#Comment_102146" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T23:58:18+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:58PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments Per, I think they chime in a lot with what has been said on this thread already.<br/><br/>In short I ran the wrong sort of game, because I didn't know how to run my own game ... which is a fun quandry for me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I didn't come to the table with the right mindset, and as a result of that I messed things up, which made for a difficult session and did not realise the potential of the game. And no, the pre-prepared plot is not inherant, in fact the advice is gone now <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I wonder if you would be willing to try running a session the way you would like to have seen it run?

I *do* tend to back down when around new people though, which might have had something to do with it.<br/><br/>I felt it was a bit ropey in places, because we didn't understand the mechanics, but I also felt we were trying to cram too much into too little time because we only had one session</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
