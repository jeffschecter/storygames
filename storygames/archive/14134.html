This gets at a divide between the philosphies and function of this kind of play (that includes most trad and indie play) vs the kind that includes Jeep (where you often know the story ahead of time, or all is available to everyone as it happens in play). In the first, knowing where you are going when the whole point is to have tension inserted into the experience of play by having forking paths that surprise, upset and delight the players would kill that beautiful tension. <br/><br/>However, if what you're shooting for is intense play, that everyone is on board for, and the surprise and delight come from the details of what happens. Or even that they way you're adding fiction is by having everyone generally know the overall thrust of the story, or certain benchmarks that will guide play--since you are not having an external input (eg dice) create the tension of play, but the sheer surprise of what a moment in as story will look and feel like, or what decisions the human players make about motivation. Then knowing what will happen can function beautifully. <br/><br/>The strengths of the "into the unknown" play style is that, conceivably, you can have a much broader variety of stories since you are not married to a single tale. As it plays out though, I challenge you to show me how broad our exploration of tales has been in rpg as a whole. I think we're getting more diversity now. <br/><br/>A weakness of "known story play" is that not everyone wants to know what will happen. If you can't buy in to that tool, play will break down for you. I expect that there may be prejudice against it that would not be borne out by play, though.

In music, I like things that take elements thoroughly familiar to the band and the audience and use them to get into a groove that can be sustained almost infinitely, but will always be an organic extension of the same thing rather than something that hits and runs, like a perfectly crafted two-minute pop-punk song or a symphony with discrete movements.<br/><br/>So to take Bill's dictate, it seems to me that this kind of thing is what you're going to get from "into the unknown": unpredictable outcomes that don't stray too far from the narrow confines of the conventions established by the genre and system, very well-suited to long-term play. <br/><br/>Some aspects of the Jeepform Truths seem to suggest that they produce the opposite: ending a game after three hours instead of six, whereas what I want to do is still be dancing when the sun comes up. Others aren't: "can be played several times" is a goal for my preferred style too, I heard about a long-running annual convention in France where what they do every year is play Gygax's Keep on the Borderlands module and am mad with envy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>A weakness of "known story play" is that not everyone wants to know what will happen.

(Interestingly, both this and adventure paths are designed for long-form play, although in my hands the latter worked less well the longer we did it).<br/><br/>Ultimately:<br/>- I'm the kind of person who would rather leave the library with all ten volumes of Hugh Cook's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_an_Age_of_Darkness" rel="nofollow">Chronicles of an Age of Darkness</a> series, and lament that it didn't run out to sixty books as planned, than an equivalent page-count of equally well written short story collections.<br/>- My personal preferences may or may not influence my ideas about what formats best take advantage of a genre or media's unique virtues: I think long-form into the unknown play best explores what I think is unique to roleplaying (versus acting etc. which I don't really know anything about), and that's what I like best; I think the novella is the ideal length for science fiction, even though I prefer long series of novels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320518/#Comment_320518" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T10:04:25+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 10:04AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            11.Always make sure that the players know what they are playing, and where the story should be going.<br/>12.A game can be played several times with the same players playing the same characters.<br/><br/>I think 11 and 12 should be looked at together as a matched pair.

But I understand that jeepform purposely has different goals than the type of larp I usually participate in, and I accept that.<br/><br/>In my mind, this makes jeepform "tabletop rp without dice, or a table".<br/><br/>As I wrote in the 2010 WyrdCon Summit Book (<a href="http://www.mortalisrpg.com/forum/downloads/2010SummitBook.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mortalisrpg.com/forum/downloads/2010SummitBook.pdf</a>) I think that the one thing that larp does better than any other medium of expression is simultaneous action - creating the sense that right now, in this moment, multiple significant things are happening relating to this game and you, as your character, are only participating in some of them, though you know that others are exist. <br/><br/>You see a group in your peripheral vision having a heated conversation that you think may relate to something you care about, for example, but you are busy completing this trade negotiation with another player and you can't delay it without risking losing the advantage you have at the moment. Plus, you know that in the next room, something else important is happening, cause you saw it on your way over here. But you really need to finish this negotiation right now, even though it means you aren't participating in those other conversations. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>To me, simultaneous action is the "great divide" between tabletop play and larp play. But small games with a single location and focused action set aside that possiblity.<br/><br/>Which is fine. They gain things in the bargain. The game becomes more of a shared experience. There is a decreased experience of the fractured multiplicity of experience that you get in a big sprawling game where one player's experience of the event is vastly different from another's. And there are benefits to that.<br/><br/>But it bugs me a bit. It feels kind of like sitting down in front of a TV or movie screen and seeing a slideshow. The photography may be good, but it's not taking advantage of the medium. Even Ken Burns documentaries, which tend to have a lot of still photographs in them, mix things up with interviews and reinactments and music, to take advantage of the medium he has to work with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320533/#Comment_320533" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T10:56:47+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 10:56AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that Vi \xe5ker jeep ever called its form Larp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320545/#Comment_320545" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T11:14:34+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 11:14AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'all noticed the first paragraph that explicitly describes the Truths as descriptive, not prescriptive, and guidelines, not rules, right?<br/><br/>I mean, this seems like people are taking issue with "A log cabin shall be made of logs" by complaining that they don't like logs, or cabins, or they're happy in their cinder-block condominium.<br/><br/>In that light, this is the sort of nitpick I think is more fair:<br/><br/>"9.

The first big discussions and analyses of it happened through the Knutepunkt conferences.<br/><br/>It's usually structured as a "living room larp", but purposely de-emphasizes things like props, costuming, and set dressing, preferring instead to focus entirely on characterization and story development.<br/><br/>It's sort of a hybrid. It uses the general format of larp, meaning that the players speak in character 90+% of the time and mechanics are designed to appear as in-fiction as possible, like the bird-in-ear technique which allows the GM to guide the action by using a simulation of a spoken internal monologue. And they make some use of physical space - players sitting next to each other are characters sitting next to each other. But it also shares a lot with tabletop rp - it's done with a small group and only one thing is happening at a time, allowing all the players to experience all of the action.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, jeepform is an attempt to take the best elements of larp and the best elements of tabletop and combine them together in a narative-first hybrid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320628/#Comment_320628" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T16:56:59+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  4:56PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I played the jeep game "Doubt" in January of 2008 it was a really great experience and I found that knowing the narrative and scene structure ahead of time did not mean knowing what, of the important stuff with the characters and their relationships, was going to happen.<br/><br/>I might say the same thing about MLWM, by the way.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320673/#Comment_320673" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T22:52:23+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 10:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I don't think that Vi \xe5ker jeep ever called its form Larp.</blockquote>\nWell ...  as I understand it most American gamers cry "LARP!" as soon as any of the players gets out of the comfy chair. :-)<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I think there could just be a difference of terminology.  As I have understood the American gaming scene from podcasts and reading forums there are basically two terms that are being used "role playing" and "LARPing".  In Swedish we have various words and expressions for game forms that fall in different places along that spectrum.  Calling Jeep games LARPs would be reasonable using the binary system, but when a scale that shows finer nuances is used calling Jeep games LARPs would be miss leading.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Also, I have never played in any of the Jeep games. I have played WITH Jeep game masters, but that was dirty hippie WTWE, not Jeep.  I base my opinion in this matter on superstition alone. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320794/#Comment_320794" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-15T11:24:32+00:00" title="April 15, 2011 11:24AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>I think there could just be a difference of terminology. As I have understood the American gaming scene from podcasts and reading forums there are basically two terms that are being used "role playing" and "LARPing". <br/></blockquote>\nI use the terms "tabletop" and "larp" as 2 different media of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Much as I use "film" (sometimes I say cinema, but film is a better term) and "photography" to refer to 2 different media that involve capturing light.<br/><br/>There's lots of types of film, from commercials to TV sit coms to YouTube videos to slasher horror movies to Casablanca.<br/><br/>And photography likewise gets used in many ways - magazine ads, photojournalism, flyers for lost puppies, and Ansel Adams prints.<br/><br/>But I think there is benefit in the distinction between film and photography.<br/><br/>And I think there is benefit in the distinction between tabletop and larp roleplaying.<br/><br/>But like I said, jeep is larp play that consciously foregoes some of the possibilities of the larp play and instead focuses on some of the elements that are really good about tabletop.<br/><br/>It's like putting an Ansel Adams photo on a TV screen. And maybe adding a soundtrack. That's not a criticism. Putting an Ansel Adams photo on a screen is a pretty excellent choice, in my opinion. In fact, I'm tempted to change my monitor wallpaper, now that I think about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320998/#Comment_320998" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-17T15:33:44+00:00" title="April 17, 2011  3:33PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Upon carefully parsing the Jeepform list, in detail, I have only one thought that I feel needs to be expressed:<br/><br/><i>That's just, like, your opinion, man.</i></blockquote>\nThat's exactly why i lurk these threads, because it always helps me know what i'm looking for a bit better.  There are a lot of things said in these dissections that i get, or don't get, or love or am shocked by.  When it finally simmers to a forgotten thought i know what i'm going for in a game just a little bit better.  And i know more about what i'm giving to the people that play with me, too.<br/><br/>I love opinions.
