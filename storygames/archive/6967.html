Are there any obvious red flags that you see when you read this? One that I'm aware of is trying for a mix of tactical map-play and story-telling, so striking that balance will be tricky.<br/>\n2. Which questions pop up in your head when you read this? Should I try to answer these?<br/>\n3. What, if anything, do you 'hope' to get out of the final product, when you read the below? (No, I will not be trying to please everyone, but I am curious, of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Wat is your game about?<br/>\n<br/>\nMSG is about blasting zombies with your buddies and telling each other how that'd make a cool/gripping movie/story.<br/>\n<br/>\nMSG is about cooperatively and tactically fighting enemies on about 5 different maps and interfacing/combining that fighting with players telling the story of why this fighting is meaningful to the player characters. The resolution should be fast, involve no randomizing and require few exceptions or special rules. The setting, characters and events are described by players and voted on. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) What do the characters do?<br/>\n<br/>\nFight zombies in an effort to reach the group 'goal' (which could be fixing the outbreak, or permanently retire to a recluse island, etc.). Experience the horror of the zombie movie and express their personality. Get horrified (or not).<br/>\nThere are 'downtime' rules for 'not fighting on the map' both to support the-character-of-the-player-that-couldn't-make-it-to-the-session and the character current GM.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) What do the players do?<br/>\n<br/>\nTactially play the characters on the zombie-fighting map, create story/fiction and vote on each other's fiction to include it in the overall story. The GM provides opposition to the players on the map (the level of which is 80% determined by player input).<br/>\nThe GM role may rotate: this is not required.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) How does the setting reinforce what the game is about?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe invariant element of the (vanilla) game is 'a group of people fighting zombies': other settings element are variable to allow the players to connect to the setting/story.<br/>\nThe choice of zombies allows for fast resolution since their 'tactical game plan' is very simple and easily executed by the GM/zombie player. The zombie-movie concept does not require many different types of monsters: one is enough.<br/>\n(There is a special place for zombies which the player character had a strong relationship with before the zombie's death: this is given a place in the rules and a recurring aspect of zombie movies).<br/>\n<br/>\n5) How does the character creation system reinforce what the game is about?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character creation system is run in parallel with the setting creation, also do by players. It allows players whose fiction contributions are rewarded to pick from pre-defined advantages, disadvantages and gear. These pre-defined elements are strongly themed to horror movies and tied to the mechanics of map-fighting or story-contribution resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n6&amp;7) Good tactical play is rewarded by your character not dying nor picking up 'horrified' points (a 'bad' thing).<br/>\n'Good' creation of fiction (as rewarded by your fellow players) allow 'better' character generation and influence on what the GM may do when creating the mini-map and the opposition force.<br/>\nBad tactical play is punished by character death / (end-game)penalties. Allowing other player characters to die also gives an end-game penalty (horrification).<br/>\nCreation of unappreciated fiction gives slightly decreased shaping power on the current GM and less final write-up in the 'and this is how it was remembered', but this can be valid play (not everyone needs the spotlight).<br/>\n<br/>\n8) How are narration and credibility divided in your game?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn in the mini-map, players have full and unshared control over their own character. The Zombie-player draws the map and places/plays opposition (previously restricted by player input).<br/>\nThe GM role may rotate.<br/>\nTelling the story is done by first writing down the essence of what you a player wants to add: after the vote, this is entered into the story based on the amount of votes received.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) What does your game do to command attention, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt allows players to challenge each other tactically and reward each other for cool story-telling. Viscerally, they get to blow away / chainsaw zombies and maybe Save The World (TM)!<br/>\n<br/>\n10) What are the resolution mechanics like?<br/>\n<br/>\nVote-based creation of story / setting. Tactical resolution of the map, no dice. Very low tracking of skills/hit points etc. Expenditure by the zombie player of opposition points at will but restricted by rules to determine level of moment-by-moment opposition within a greater whole.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw" title="tobiasopdenbrouw"><img alt="tobiasopdenbrouw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw">tobiasopdenbrouw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155181/#Comment_155181" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T05:49:56+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  5:49AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>\n<br/>\n11) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what the game is about?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a distinct difference between the hectic, limited-option moments of 'fighting' as done in zombie movies (blast'm all and hope to live) and the story-addition game where players get to express to each other what their (character's) experience of this fighting is about.<br/>\nThe zombie-players freedom to plop down 18 zombies in a room with a just-opened door creates tenstion for players that mimics the characters un-awereness of what's going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n12) Do characters advance in your game? If so, how?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe zombie-movie does not follow characters for years on end, so advancement is limited to what the characters would be capable of during a (long) zombie outbreak and battling that.<br/>\nAs such, the following are tracked for the endgame: horrified (how much bad shit happened to the character and how it shaped them), memorable (how much what this person did will be remembered by the generations after).<br/>\nIn the game, weapon-use may advance weapon-using skills in a limited way.<br/>\nCharacters may also change as described in each player's fiction, but that will have no (or limited) mechanical effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n13) How does character advancement reinforce what the game is about?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's limited advancement on skills, because dealing with things as the characters currently are is more important than skill growth.<br/>\nThere's tracking of horrified and memorable to be able to express internal and external growth/change as visible in the overall movie/story.<br/>\nThis game is about dealing with stuff NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\n14). What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the players to be able to toss danger at each other without having to pull punches. I want them to be able to enjoy the tactical game and able to influence that tactical game by weaving group-appreciated story around it.<br/>\nI want them to try their best for their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n15) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pre-defined list receives a lot attention, as this will be all groups building blocks for their zombie movie. An important piece of color (zombie look, sound and smell) is actually set by players.<br/>\nActual play examples will be used a lot, probably a lighter-themed series and a more grim series.<br/>\n<br/>\n16) Which part of your game are you most excited by or interested in?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing the players try to grok the group's ideal zombie story (at that moment) and try to meet it with cool story additions.<br/>\nHaving the zombie player draw maps restrained partly by the player-set restrictions for that map.<br/>\nEither dropping zombies on the player's heads as zombie player and making their life difficult, or trying to anticipate the zombies as a character<br/>\nSeeing the group succeed or fail as a group, and figuring out how each character ends up and is remembered.<br/>\n<br/>\n17) Where does your game take the players that other games can't, or wont?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a spot where they can all both tactically blast away at zombies and tell each other war-stories before and afterwards with a system that rewards both.<br/>\nIf other games do this as well: I want to know which! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n18) What are your publishing goals for this game?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm more interested in getting my own friends a good time and getting my name on a known 'cool game' than money. I have a day job for that.<br/>\nIf it's a hit, I may make a 'pretty' version with purchased art, layout, etc., and charge a small fee for a .pdf.<br/>\n<br/>\n19) Target audience<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers that play both board/light-tactical games and RPG's and would like to combine them. Hey, that's the whole D&amp;D 4e demographic! ;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155218/#Comment_155218" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T10:31:03+00:00" title="July  7, 2008 10:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2008 10:33AM by lachek.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tobias,<br/><br/>Zombies and tactical combat go together really well. There are a lot of things you can do with zombies from a tactical perspective, due to their characteristics - slow, numerous, infectious, hard to kill, etcetera.<br/>Zombies and personal horror go together really well. Zombies are creepy movie monsters in the bodily horror genre, but they can also represent things like fear of dying, fear of lack of control, fear of the familiar-but-twisted, claustrophobia, attrition against overwhelming odds, and so on. Zombie fiction also tend to be full of other rich tropes like people caving under pressure, unexpected selfishness or heroism, and betrayals.<br/><br/>Tactical combat and personal horror, in my experience, <i>do not</i> go together well. Tactical combat tends to engage a different part of my brain (the mathy, gamey part) than the personal horror (the emotional, story appreciating part). The loss I experience when one of my game tokens get taken out is very real, but very different from the loss I experience when my in-game sister is overwhelmed and eaten by the living dead.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if you're going for the emotional personal horror bit with this game, but you seemed to be hinting at it - emphasis on character motivations, room for strong character relationships with now-zombified opponents, comparisons with zombie movies (which tend to be full of horror and drama). If this is a route you'd like to explore, you'd do well to take a long, hard look at how those aspects of the game interrelate with the tactical aspects, if they're in synergy, opposed or isolated from each other.<br/><br/>If you don't care for such mushy bits, mercilessly excise them from the game mechanics and make it a game about badasses killing dead dudes. If I'm playing a dead-dude-killing badass I don't want to have a nervous breakdown mid-chainsaw-swipe because the zombie made a gurgling sound that sounded just like my dog Skippy choking on a doggie snack. I just don't find it thematically appropriate, nor particularly important to the game aspect.<br/><br/>If character advancement is not important in the game, and there is no coherent story-line to advance (I'm drawing conclusions here based on the shared scenario creation, correct me if I'm wrong), then why are the characters and their motivations important? If the game is largely tactical, and acting in-character provides nothing but colour to the game, should it really be a big part of the game? Take D&amp;D as an example - if I was just playing one-shot encounters, and didn't have personal goals to complete nor a campaign climax to work towards, would I care what god my character worships or whether he prefers redheads to blondes? I'd probably just want to kick some hobgobbie ass and high-five my buddies when we cleared the map or scored a crit - maybe I'd yell out an in-character battlecry now and then, but I do that in Battlelore and M:tG as well.<br/><br/>To sum up, I'd need to know more about the mechanics and how the game plays before I can suggest whether or not your game seems to be functional, according to my parameters of functional. I love virtual play examples, if you could crank out one of those I think it'd be really informative.<br/><br/>I'd love a good tactical zombie game. If the personal horror aspect of zombie movies could be covered coherently as well, that'd make it fantastic in my book, but I'm skeptical on that point.<br/><br/>Does that help you at all? If you clarify some points, especially your intent with the type of play that will be experienced at the table (particularly if you can do it through a virtual play example) I'll be happy to elaborate and/or reconsider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155220/#Comment_155220" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T10:55:43+00:00" title="July  7, 2008 10:55AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To emphasize some of Mikael's points, the games that I know of that do the personal horror aspects of a situation well -- Carry, Afraid/Dogs, Eero's zombie game, even The Roach -- aren't tactical in the way you describe.  I think there are varieties of horror that tactical games can convey, but most of those involve losing in combat.  For example, if you're running low on ammo or other resources, or members of your crew are gradually being torn apart, or you're being herded towards some dangerous terrain or even more terrifying zombies, or you slowly realize that you may be able to make it to point X but not back out again... that gets at the horror of your character's imminent death pretty quick, especially if you have gruesome descriptions of fleshy damage (see Riddle of Steel).  But, yeah, that's different from, say, the horror of having to shoot your zombie mother.  I do think that having group/individual goals could be cool, as long as they are things that have to be tactically achieved on the map or during combat, like getting to point X or gathering enough resource Y or rescuing miniature Z before it gets turned into a zombie.<br/><br/>But yeah, I guess the real question is how much do you want your game to go beyond being a mission-based tactical boardgame with potential for campaign-style play, maintaining the same characters over multiple sessions?  What other stuff are you really dedicated to including?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155221/#Comment_155221" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T10:59:25+00:00" title="July  7, 2008 10:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2008 11:01AM by lachek.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't already, I urge you to have a look at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070504013120/www.luchacabra.com/?p=42" rel="nofollow">Age of the Dead</a> by Daniel Solis.

I'm more interested in the tactical play than the deep-emotion-wrangling, though. The story-telling exists to:<br/>\n<br/>\n- make the game more than just 'bashing zombies'. I want a touch more attachment to your pawn than 'shucks, my pawn got eaten'.<br/>\n- provide a way to reward the creative, story-telling powers of the players as well as connect to the mechanism which will determing which player has priority in setting the gm's limits on the available opposition.<br/>\n- provide a way for the end-game result to mean something more than 'we beat the zombies' - but 'we beat the zombies, mike turned out to be the doomed hero but boy did he take a bunch of them with him, and shame Elly got eaten on the way, specially after she manager to jump on the pick-up truck so well.'<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in seeing whether the anticipation of possible loss / threat to 'my guy', combined with the 'fuck, in I'm this place, I don't know where the z's are gonna come from, can we get in and out before the building's swarmed and we run out of bullets' will make for a good tactical game where you can root for your guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've looked at Age of the Dead and Walking Dead, of course (thanks for those links!). Age of the Dead focuses more on the emotional aspect than I would like to. Walking Dead is huge, so I haven't read it in detail (yet), but it too seems more focused on personal matters than I would like to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 'horrified' and 'memorable' tracks are not meant for in-the-moment emotional play. They're more like end-game counters like My Life With Master. There are no rules for inter-player emotional play (other than telling a bit of story and getting it voted on once). You will not be blocked from your chainsaw swipe by the memory of Skippy. There's no time for freaking out in combat - adrenaline's pumping, there's no time to think - there may be some fall-out afterwards, but talking about this is like swapping war stories and 'scoring' the play - by telling stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw" title="tobiasopdenbrouw"><img alt="tobiasopdenbrouw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw">tobiasopdenbrouw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155259/#Comment_155259" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T14:23:35+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  2:23PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued) <br/>\n<br/>\nA virtual play example... ok, let's see what I can do in the short time before I have to go to bed with my lovely, about-to-be-a-mother (we hope), girlfriend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting creation:<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the question: What is the cause of the outbreak?

He thought it was programmed at a break-away state, but it's actually fired at Alaska, the first infected were hunters, oil people, etc."<br/>\n<br/>\nSilva: "The zombie outbreak is God's Flood 2.0: it's the cleaning of the earth before Angels and Demons fight out Armageddon on earth."<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone Votes: Eline gets 16 points, tobias gets 8, and Silva gets 6. Eline's story is the 'true'  one. She gets to pick from the pre-defined lists first, and picks up a piece of gear: the shotgun. Tobias goes second and picks up the disadvantage: Screamer. Silva grabs the 'swing, batter!' advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n(This repeats with different questions until everyone has 6 characteristics).<br/>\n<br/>\nFight preparation:<br/>\n<br/>\nEline: "This first fight is where everyone gets together. So it's a real public place in New Orleans: Louis Armstrong International Airport. My guy is a pilot: he's looking for any plane that can take him out of here."<br/>\n<br/>\nTobias: "Nah: the quarantine shut all that down. We're at a repair shop for Monster Trucks - that'll get us across everything. Joe's Mechanics has a big junkyard out back, and there's a pawn broker next door where we can pick up some armament as well, if we're lucky." <br/>\n<br/>\nSilva: "You guys are too fixed on transport: we'll need weapons first. We're at Charlton Heston's Villa - aka the NRA's secret bunker. This'll get us everything we need, and then some."<br/>\n<br/>\n(GM says nothing)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter voting, Silva goes first. He pick the 'location general description'  aspect, and tells the GM: "Draw half-villa, half-bunker: a large complex".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other players cannot change that, so Tobias then picks: "Relatively light zombie presence".<br/>\n<br/>\nEline ends it by saying "2 personally relevant zombies on the map."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM can pick his own desires from the non-described aspects, but must abide by the player selections in drawing the map. He determines the zombie opposition based on the formula (to be developed) and used his own 20% tuning freedown to increase the zombie presence above what the players are expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the map-play, the GM has (say) 30 zombies, of which 2 'personal'  at his disposal. After some play and a few zombies shuffling at the player, some door being opened, and few zombies encountered, the GM springs all his built-up power to that point on the players: three door open simultaneously as the players are in a T-shaped intersection. The players retreat, blasting away (spending lots of ammo), and a few getting so close to the zombies for a while that they pick up horrified points. None of them get bitten though (this happens automatically when 3 zombies surround you on any turn). <br/>\n<br/>\n(Map play is going to require the most pages actually explaining, I think)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the postmortem, the three players all describe what they thought was the coolest moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nEline tells a scene about the gun-lover fest they see when the bunker doors swing open on all that weaponry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilva re-tells the harrowing encounter in the T-shaped intersection.<br/>\n<br/>\nTobias talks about his uncle Charlton, shambling at him, and what goes through his mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players vote and determine that Silva was the most memorable, then Tobias, then Eline.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey continue playing these scenes until the big finale, when they use the post-mortem phase for a wrap-up, inspired by MLWM-esque mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help you any?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really helpful, thanks much!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155276/#Comment_155276" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T16:42:33+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  4:42PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, the voting on setting-creation aspects are interesting, since I can't think of anything quite like that.  It's a bit like Balderdash (vote on player input to choose who wins) or Universalis (competitively create setting elements) or Mist-Robed Gate (vote on which player wins a fight, based on how its described) or Shock: (where the other players swing the result to resemble the group consensus), without being that much like any of them.<br/><br/>What are your battlemap mechanics inspired by?  Board games like Last Night on Earth / Zombies!!! / etc.?  Fighty RPGs like Agon and D&amp;D (with miniatures)?  Video games like Zombies Ate My Neighbors / Dead Rising / Resident Evil?  All of the above?

That could be a research no-no, on the other hand, my mind is not corrupted by their styles. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to battlemap mechanics: they're mostly inspired by a Dutch RPG from the early 90s called Urg. I haven't played Last Night on Earth / Zombies!!! (nor do I know anyone who owns them) but I've observed D&amp;D miniature gaming. It's not as complex as D&amp;D, certainly. It's a square-grid map where every player has 5 AP each turn. (Characteristics may modify this). Zombie's have 2 AP on their turn and always home in on PC's. One step = 1 AP. Diagonal step = 2 AP. Opening a door (which is an important event, since zombies may be placed as a result of it): 3RP. Shooting a pistol to totally destroy a Z: 4 AP (less for Laming it, or Knocking it over).<br/>\n<br/>\nA player gets bitten and 'dies' if he's ever next to 3 zombie at the same time. A player takes a point of 'horrified' if he borders 2 zombies on the zombies turn. Zombies don't have 'attacks', they just shamble in. Zombies, standing or Lame, do have a 'zone of control', but its effect is only to add 1 AP to each player step.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent player tactics are informed by their characteristics and the weapons they carry. Due to the limited gear amount, there won't be a profileration of powers to remember or rules exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players move towards a goal on-map and have to get out. I'm going to run playtests to see what their average speeds and bullet consumption rates are, and tweak the limited resources (time, bullets) stress mechanics accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be checking out that Aliens game to see what I can do to bring on the tense and horrific!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw" title="tobiasopdenbrouw"><img alt="tobiasopdenbrouw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tobiasopdenbrouw">tobiasopdenbrouw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155318/#Comment_155318" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T02:36:29+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  2:36AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 3:43AM by tobiasopdenbrouw.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ken,<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked out the game, and there are a bunch of similarities, amusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also discovered an online version using Flash: http://www.minijuegos.com/juegos/jugar.php?id=6004<br/>\n<br/>\nand a rules download at http://files.boardgamegeek.com/geekfile_view.php?fileid=5040<br/>\n<br/>\nWill try that today. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I've also discovered the following download: http://www.fortressfigures.com/zombieplague/ .

Willpower and the different Motivations are your main tools in the game, and as they change they determine the story line. There is some tactical play, but all choices are made on the story level - do I take the initiative in this high-Threat scene or hold back until later? Do I use a gun (which will eventually fail me) or an ice pick (which will only get better with time)?<br/><br/>But yeah, it's not The Walking Dead - what is?
