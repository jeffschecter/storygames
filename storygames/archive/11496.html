As the name strongly implies, it has a supernatural element, but absolutely doesn't need it. (The most important effect of the supernatural side of the game is that it allows the players the freedom to make up their own laws and case history with respect to ghosts, vampires, and their ilk. That makes you feel like a real life lawyer, which is a lot of fun. If you're comfortable with it, you could just make up non-supernatural case history and probably get the same feeling.)<br/><br/>However, if investigating the <i>truth</i> is important to you, this game might not be your cup of tea.

What kinds of stories do you want told?</blockquote>\nGreat question! My primary inspiration is the American TV show <em>Bones</em>, which I love to death. Each week, there's a murder to be solved. The main characters work at the "Jeffersonian Institute" (the Smithsonian) and are headed by a forensic anthropologist. Using clues from damage to the bones, particulates, and police investigation work (one of the characters is in the FBI, the rest are scientists), they solve the murder. In the meantime, the main characters have job-related stresses and flirt a lot.<br/><br/>So, not hard-boiled, not supernatural, not even a lot of police stuff. It's definitely there, but we're not talking The Wire or Homicide or Law &amp; Order.<br/><br/>The thing that seems difficult to replicate in a game is skillful investigation into an actual mystery that the players can solve or fail to solve. If I were free-forming something like this, I, as GM, would have to know a lot about the different investigative techniques the characters can use, and the players would have to know about their character's techniques. I'd have to create an actual hard-to-solve murder, and be ready to answer any questions the characters will have about evidence. That's obviously overwhelming and not sustainable. That's what's cool about the TV show - someone has put that left of thought into each episode - but you can't do it in an RPG. Using mechanics like skill tests to get clues without having player-level investigation is boring, and without an innovative system, is basically a game of luck. I worry that a game where the players build up toward a suspect which is not determined before-hand, but in play, would be dissatisfying, as we all know that we didn't actually solve anything, but instead made something.<br/><br/>So I'm stymied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256180/#Comment_256180" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T12:58:00+00:00" title="February 11, 2010 12:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the elimination process is dissatisfying?

I worry that a game where the players build up toward a suspect which is not determined before-hand, but in play, would be dissatisfying, as we all know that we didn't actually solve anything, but instead made something.</blockquote>\n<i><a href="http://darkomengames.com/secrets.html" rel="nofollow">Dirty Secrets</a></i> was my attempt to answer this question. Personally, I like my GMless collaboration but, as you say, just setting up a mystery and then saying, "And then we solve it!" doesn't seem particularly satisfying. On the other hand, the RPG equivalent of pixel-hunting isn't particularly satisfying, either.<br/><br/><i>Dirty Secrets</i> tries to address this in a couple of ways. First, all but one of the players share the "GM" role. (Well, kinda, but it works for the sake of this example.) Connect this to the rule that you can only say things that the investigator can see, and you create a Rashomon-type effect, where each player's differing perspectives on the situation and characters creates uncertainty and surprise for the players. In a similar way, the game forbids you to solve the specific crimes at the center of the game. Instead, the mechanics will eventually give you the perpetrator of the crimes, which you then justify in light of the fiction that has been created so far.<br/><br/>That being said, <i>Dirty Secrets</i> can give you a sense of surprise, but it will never give you a sense of discovery. (This distinction was discussed in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8337" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.) My sense is that Gumshoe would do a fine job of handling discovery. Of course, the basic outcome of a solved mystery isn't in doubt, but is that really a problem? It's a rare mystery story that ends without the mystery being solved. What's at stake in a mystery story is (almost) never "Will the detective solve the case?" but "How will the detective solve the case?" From this perspective, Gumshoe makes perfect sense. In fact, as Graham has mentioned elsewhere, both <i>Dirty Secrets</i> and Gumshoe share a similar conceit: they work by de-emphasizing the mechanics of investigating, which allows the story to focus on other things, usually the characters' response to the mystery. And, isn't that the "job-related stresses" and flirtations that you talk about with <i>Bones</i>?<br/><br/>(BTW, if anyone is looking into mystery gaming, I highly recommend <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2910" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for your enlightenment and edification.

This scenario is sometimes quite tightly plotted although the game copes well with deviation.<br/><br/>Typically there will be a hook to get the characters involved a spine of core clues that lead from the initial scene to the last scene and a GM only piece on the dreadful truth. Then each scene will have a description saying what kind of scene it is, what the core clue is and how it can be obtained as well as pointers for supplementary clues and benefits. There will also be descriptions of the major NPCs. The thing with the core clues is that they don't tell you who did it. If you were playing Murder on the Orient Express, the core clues would lead to all the information being gathered and everyone assembled together at the end, but they wouldn't necessarily tell you who did it. Typically supplementary clues lead to more precise information about the truth.<br/><br/>This isn't as linear as it might seem. I ran a Cthulhu scenario set in Kingsport about a haunted theatre. The PCs were asked to discover the source of the haunting. There were lots of clues that lead to lots of other clues. The PCs took the information on board and came to some understanding of what was going on. It was partially correct, enough so that they could give a satisfactory report to their employer and even stop the haunting but it was by no means the only way to settle things. This was a rather more open-ended and unstructured sandbox kind of adventure in which there was no set path through all the core clues.<br/><br/>I've run a scenario set in 1936 Paris four times now and each group has come to a slightly different understanding of what was going on, leading to different endings and very different survival levels.<br/><br/>The basic idea is to ensure that the PCs always have an indication of where they might go next, but not necessarily what that means.<br/><br/>GUMSHOE separates out investigation and action. Action requires the use of the dice and the outcome is not certain as it is with investigation. Action scenes are pretty traditional and the rules are kept simple so as not to extend these scenes. Rarely do these scenes last more than 10 or 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Another important factor in GUMSHOE is that each character has a drive which is the reason why they might continue to investigate when someone else might not. These are levers for the GM to use to test a character's resolve and throw up interesting dilemmas for the players.<br/><br/>Most of the time, in my experience, GUMSHOE players are in character, interacting with NPCs or talking to each other about clues, progress of the investigation or any moral qualms they might have about what's happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256273/#Comment_256273" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T05:13:44+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  5:13AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite><br/>It's just naming a skill, rolling a die, and getting info. The opposite approach would be to choose a skill, roll, and based off the success of the die, you get to describe in detail what you've found, but then you're back to players making up the mystery instead of solving it.<br/>it.</blockquote>\nBasically, you want a game where there is no pre-defined mystery, and you want a collaborative approach to creating the mystery is. That's InSpectres or a similar game, rather than standard GUMSHOE (there is an improv GUMSHOE).<br/><br/>Um, no, I don't. That was one of the things I said I specifically don't like, for the reasons you mentioned, even in the part you quoted. I have played plenty of InSpectres, and I find it dissatisfying.<br/><br/>Simon, could you tell me more about how GUMSHOE works, as it seems to be one of the games mentioned on this thread that most matches what I'm looking for? I will likely get it, but dropping $40 + shipping without really understanding how it works scares me a little.<br/><br/>Oh, I'm very sorry. I didn't read you clearly enough and took that post out of context. You say you haven't played many satisfying games where the GM creates a mystery and you solve it. So, I am assuming you want a satisfying version of such a game?<br/><br/>In GUMSHOE you always get the information or leads you essentially need to continue (you don't roll, you just get the info if you have the right ability) but that any other information is paid for from a pool of points. If players think of clever ways of getting information which you haven't considered, then they can do so. Now, what "information" consists of can be fine tuned. It can either be a lead in itself, or it can be something the players personally have to figure out. This, I think, for you is the sticking point. You (and not the game system) will have to fine tune how much work you think the players will enjoy.<br/><br/>You basically creating an adventure spine work back from the crime towards where the PCs start, putting in possible clues, incuding physical evidence, knowledge, and contacts, then you let the PCs loose on it. You record the skills the PCs have so you can tailor the game to them - treating their choices as a direct indication of the sort of game they want to play. Then you partly use you spine, plus incorporation, to run the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256286/#Comment_256286" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T07:02:32+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  7:02AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/><br/>Thanks for explaining - that sounds right up my alley. <br/><br/>I wasn't very clear before: I'm looking for games that are satisfying, full stop, but my perception is that games where there is a mystery set up ahead of time, with a real answer, is more satisfying than a game where the solution to the mystery is not set ahead of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256388/#Comment_256388" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T15:34:53+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  3:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2010 3:37PM by phargle.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a broken system in many ways, but In Nomine can be a fun and satisfying investigative game.  Angels can do a lot of cool, mystic stuff to research problems because they can see clues human investigators can't, and that's fun.  GMs accustomed to certain types of investigative games can run into trouble with this - for example, a Seraph knows if someone is lying.  As a GM, the challenge to the players can't be "Find out if he's lying," but rather has to be "Figure out what you do about him lying."  It's similar with Elohim, Malakim, Mercuriens. . . you can have cool scenes where a Malakite scans a room for sins (although this requires wiggle on the Malakite mechanic), while the Elohite analyzes the subject. . . what will he do if I ask him about the crime?  What will he do if I accuse him outright?  Total awesome.<br/><br/>I think having a solution in advance is risky.  If the players just don't get the clues based on the keyhole view into your world that you give them, the game will go down in flames.  I prefer to have a vague idea of whodunit, and let the players use their skills to learn the answers.  If a player can succeed at Criminology on a 16 or less on 3d6, that can mean that they find any clues available on a 16 or less. . . OR, it can mean they're an awesome investigator, and can use their skill to get clues (ie, hints) when investigating a crime scene.  That's almost more fun.  Some of my most fun mysteries were not ideas that I had, but rather ideas my players had.  They'd say something like, "Is there a hidden panel under the duke's desk?" and I'd think, "Wow, that's a cool idea," and say, "Roll a search and see if you can find it."  Then I'd put the clue there.<br/><br/>That's basically a variant of letting the character skill grant success (as opposed to letting it grant access to success through GM fiat.)<br/><br/>Anyway, In Nomine, playing angels.  Good luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256398/#Comment_256398" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T15:57:31+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  3:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting into this a bit late, but: <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>. You don't know what the clues will be. You don't know how you'll find them. You don't even know what the mystery is. I mean, seriously, if you use an investigative playset like either of the alternate settings included in the book, and that's the game people want to play, you have the possibility of real discovery, of being surprised at every turn. No one knows the answer in advance, and there's no front-loaded prep. Penny is a wonderful game.<br/><br/>If you want to steer your game specifically to investigation, you could try adding just one fact to the F&amp;R document, something like "You were discovered with your memory blank and a still-unidentified body, cooling on the floor next to you." That might do it. Or you could set yourself up to be like the main character in <i>Memento</i> right at the middle of the movie, where you have a guy in your closet and you can't remember why. Maybe the group, as a whole, was found in the presence of a victim, and you'll be tying your stories together. That could be fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
