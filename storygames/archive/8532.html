I agree that the $11 price tag was sort of annoying, but it's a dollar so I didn't worry about it. With the disclaimer of not having actually played the game yet, here's what I thought about it:<br/><br/>-Good layout, and cartoon art throughout, with plenty of diagrams and such. It looks like a very well put together rule book for a high end board game, with full color illustrations and diagrams on every single page.<br/>-On the subject of boardgames, this isn't an RPG. Rather, it's a set of rules for using any minis (specifically those little ones you get from Japanese style capsule machines, hence the name gachapon fighters, although it would work for any minis) in a war game like battle. You basically assign skills and abilities using a simple point buy system and then have a battle. <br/>-The system itself seems to be good, although I haven't got a chance to try it myself. I'm not sure how having to stat each guy out on your own would work out, but like I said, I wouldn't know. I don't think it'd be that big of an issue in actuality, since the "armies" are kind of small by the default rules.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion I'd say if you were looking for a build your own war game with a martial arts/super hero feel then this would be up your alley, but it won't deliver story, so if that's what you want, this isn't your thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189036/#Comment_189036" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T11:28:36+00:00" title="January 19, 2009 11:28AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahhh, ok. So it's not actually an RPG. That part was throwing me off.<br/><br/>So it's kind of like a Mechaton, but with Gatchapon goodies instead of LEGO goodies. That's pretty cool.<br/><br/>LMK if you end up playing.

The really long name pokes fun of Capcom's (the game company) video game naming conventions. I wrote the ruleset with two other collaborators (George Carimando and Jon Valeros.) Just like many indie games, the whole game was made by a small crew, with help of many good friends for playtesting (shoutout to Thor.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhiteknife has the idea on the game pieces. I wanted players to be able to use their own toys or figures to play a game. Really, what you need are small toys and a bunch of d6s and everything else you can print out from the booklet (or from game piece PDFs on the game's message board.) Hypothetically, if all the players agree to make a popsicle stick a unit of measurement, that's fine too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a basic level, the game is about teams beating the crap out of each other for points. The rolling system is based on the number of successes you roll over your opponent (attacker rolls 4 successes, defender rolls 2, attacker hits, that sort of thing.) Depending on what attacks you perform you get 3 types of benefits. First is a "charge" which can be used to make some attacks more damaging. Second is the "Battle Die" which is a die pool that can be used to add dice to rolls. Finally you get points based on how many Battle Dice you receive. There is your basic combo attack, a throw and 8 types of techniques. The techniques are the types of special moves you see in video fighting games, fireballs, piledrivers, diving attacks, or dragon punches, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending how much damage you do, you can send your opponent flying across the battlefield. A great way to send fighters into their teammates (for more points.) We found that the game is not only about doing the most damage to the other team but also repositioning them to optimize your next attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the feedback. I have to run to work, but if you have any other questions I would be glad to answer them!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189148/#Comment_189148" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T09:04:12+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  9:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, I got a chance to play this game at a NerdNYC event last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is pretty sweet.

Lots of fun as a 4 player game from my experience. It's definitely a game that has had the benefit of extensive playtesting. I like the d6 die pool mechanic, how you can charge your specials and combo in multiple hit moves. The game is also full of choice. How do I spend my specials? Should I crush my dice for a re-roll? Should I focus on movement, defensive, range, easy to hit / less damage, harder to hit / more damage? The layout of the PDF is great. I haven't read it myself yet (I played with people who already knew how to play) so i can't vouch for the text. But I know there was extensive editing. I'm going to buy it myself next week so if I have more thoughts I will post soon. I believe oldsalty (John) will be demoing at Dreamation. <br><br>One of the coolest things is you can launch a slow moving fireball and use it as movable terrain! <br/><br/>It feels like you are playing a boardgame version of streefighter.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
