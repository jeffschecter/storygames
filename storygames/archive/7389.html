It has about one million pages. Every single aspect of a western, from a gunfight to a rodeo stampede to skill checks to other things all have completely separate mechanics, and if I'm recalling correctly, even use different dice. I thought that was kind of a dumb idea, until the enthusiastic play reports started rolling in, with people loving that aspect of the game. Almost universally from folks who I trust on impartial and enthusiastic game reviews/play (frex, John Marron) the reaction was almost universally, "At first it's really confusing to jump from mechanic to mechanic, but it's actually a lot of fun, and we had a great time".<br/><br/>It's like getting many games in one. Or, in the console world, it's like one game made up of dozens of mini-games, all different.<br/><br/>I'm interested in this sort of thing, and was curious what other games out there that came out recently (AD&amp;D 2e had separate mechanics for hitting things, doing skills, professions, bending bars and thief skills, frex, but that's old) have the same sort of thing? Also, have you had positive experiences with non-unified mechanics?<br/><br/>I'm thinking that unified mechanics has made games so clean and tidy that it washed away a lot of Crap Design from the days of yesterday. However, these days we might be mired in a thought that a game needs a unified mechanic on all play levels in order to be a Good Game. I'm wondering if there's a future for well thought out or just downright fun non-unified design like the kind seen in Aces and Eights?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164394/#Comment_164394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T09:39:21+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  9:39AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't Burning Empires sort of like this?<br/><br/>Here are the challenges I see facing such a design:<br/><br/>1) Are the mini-games fun in their own right?

Me, I'm a systems junkie, so I like looking at new rules sets.  But bringing a game to my group like Ars Magica--a unified mechanic with a shit-ton of sub-game permutations--proved enormously challenging.  There's a serious time investment in complex systems.  So l love the ideas in Burning Wheel, for example, but wouldn't dare bring it to my current group.  I knew Ars pretty damn well, had several extra rules books to hand around, and the rules density was still daunting.  It wasn't the complexity with Ars, since everything was pretty much roll 1d10 and add modifiers.  But the number of formulae to follow for each situation grew almost fractal at points.  Too much for this group, anyway.<br/><br/>We've had our best success with Wushu, Heroquest, and Wheel of Fate.  I suspect I'd have done well with PTA or straight FATE as well, possibly True 20 because it would have been more familiar to the DnD players.<br/><br/>Levels based design as in DnD naturally seems to accomplish the gradual learning curve since the options are so limited for beginning characters.  I'm not a big fan of level-based design because I don't care for the vertical hierarchy it imposes on stories and the fictional world.

Rodeo's don't just suddenly happen because of mid-game player choice and then everyone has to scramble to learn that mini-game.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164432/#Comment_164432" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T13:04:56+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  1:04PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few people, including myself, played with <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14206.msg150916" rel="nofollow">an idea along these lines</a> a few years ago at the Forge.

You have this raft of skills, all of which work the same way (roll percentiles against stat, stat +10, stat +20 etc), but in the supplement they detail 3 or 4 alternate uses for each skill, little sub-games like how you run a contested chase using Shadowing, or how you make items using craft and so on. The basic system is the same (and I like that) but you different things with the bonues, or the stat values, and so on.<br/><br/>To me such systems are best when the basic rules give you this toolbox of features you can extract from the core rolls (e.g. success, margin of success, dice sizes used, criticals, etc. etc.) and then shows you how, for given sub-systems, you can use one or more of these features to do something interesting.

Cards are good, as they can have the mechanic written on them as a quick reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the MIT assassin's guild, the "general mechanic" is (since this is a larp) "walk around and talk to people, gather and carry stuff around."  Then there's a whole library of specialty mechanics, many of which get tweaked and reused with some frequency.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbility Cards appear in basically all games -- a little card that tells you you can do something that you, as a player, can't actually do (because it's impossible, illegal, interacts with something that isn't real (like a crowd of NPCs or the game-world's internet) or you want the character to be much better than the player).  It may have requirements (you must have this much mana, may be used only on a network node, target must be helpless, you must have been in conversation with the target for at least 5 minutes)<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat is usually RPS, with extra special abilities thrown in.  Sometimes it's a stat comparison.  Sometimes both.  Sometimes it's something entirely different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurprise is based on being behind someone unnoticed for a sufficient period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDueling, Debate, or Cinematic Combat often use special cards with "attack" and "defense" squares.<br/>\n<br/>\nHacking often uses a deck of cards where you try to construct poker hands in order to write programs or dismantle security.<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch may involve pictionary, Taboo, decryption, puzzles, or the like, and almost always involves gathering items.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding things (which may include research) may involve clues and dot-hunts, where you're looking for little marks hidden around campus.<br/>\n<br/>\nWar is often represented by a war game, as complex as you might like -- there's lots on the market, or design your own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the success of these subsystems is that there is some repetition -- often you're doing something with a varriant of a system you've seen a bunch of times before.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the success of these subsystems is that a given character will only have some.  You won't have the "spellcasting" mechanic if you're not a mage, you won't have the Research mechanic unless you have something specific to research, and you won't have computer hacking unless you're a programmer.  This is related to "introducing subsystems slowly" except its spreading out what you need to know by character, rather than by level or chronology.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the success of these subsystems comes from the gamist larp mentality -- in order to Be Good at (dueling, research, exploration, ritual magic) you're expected, and you expect, to be good at the subsystem.  Figuring out how to optimize the system is part of the fun, and helps change the "my character has high strength and so is good at these six mechanics" effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fewer people have a subsystem, the more complex it can be.  The fewer subsystems a given character is expected to manage, the more complex it can be (if lots of people are computer-hacker mage duelists with research plots, these systems better not be overwhelming.  If most people have only two of these, and only people who have said "I love complex mechanics!" have more, these systems can be pretty intense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis adds another success criterion: part of the success of these subsystems comes from the fact that you're expected to focus on things you have the subsystem for, and go talk to someone else if you need someone to interact with a different subsystem.  People's assistance in a subsystem should be fairly tangential if their character is doesn't focus on that system -- the lead player may have something complex to do, so long as any assisting players have something much simpler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232447/#Comment_232447" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T09:11:45+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  9:11AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick aside:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zebediah</cite>sorry for the thread necromancy, if that's poor form on this forum.</blockquote>\nThread necromancy is totally fine, and recommended.

Nowadays, I kind of like the idea of a different deity or controlling philosophical force for each region, so that it's not just about physics per-se, but about the feel of the story.  That would justify more story-gamey type mechanics, not just physics engine stuff.  "Ah, here is the realm of Juntash, harsh god who imposes strict discipline upon the people of the land, and appoints enforcers to see that his will is done."  (Dogs)  "Now we come to the land ruled by Cerennion, a childish goddess who is always trying to please all the mortals in her land."
