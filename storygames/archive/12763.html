I finally bought the PDF a couple of weeks ago and it seemed awesome. I got some friends together to try it. The session started off okay, but our first combat bogged us way, way down, choking our fun.<br/><br/>So, any of you with Donjon experience, I'd like your advice on how to play. 'Cause, I think we were doing something wrong.<br/><br/>I think our problem stemmed from the Law of Successes and not knowing how to use it appropriately. Most of the battle (between three level 1 characters and four level 1 monsters) consisted of rolling a bunch of dice for an attack, then rolling a bunch of dice for damage, and then being foiled by damage reduction. The players felt gipped because their characters seemed ineffective. None of us had any really good ideas about what to do with successes, so most of the time they went toward Flesh Wounds. Someone came up with the idea of using a success to state the opponent had been knocked prone, and everyone else jumped on that bandwagon. <br/><br/>Most of the players were eager to experiment with calling their own shots, but we seemed stymied by a lack of imagination. (It probably doesn't help that our other campaigns are D&amp;D 3.5 9^&gt;)<br/><br/>Q                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287044/#Comment_287044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T20:02:08+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  8:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Combat always bogs us down when we play this game.  It's just a fact, and it's going to happen.  The best way to feel really awesome in that game is getting three or four actions that chain together.<br/><br/>"I run at him!"  Move action, 4 successes, rolled into<br/>"I use my tiger leap!" which is a supporting ability, rolled against DonJon level, 6 successes, rolled into<br/>"I howl menacingly!" using all those previous successes to add in and get like 8 successes, rolled into<br/>"Okay, now I'll kill him with my CLAWS!"<br/><br/>Bam, a million dice, utterly crushing the goblin.<br/><br/>You're going to get some diminishing returns if you do too many actions in a row, but you'll get a feel for it.<br/><br/>As for what to do with successes?  Use them to help your friends.  Knocking the dude prone is fine, or narrating an obstacle (forcing the defendant against a wall) something like that to give other people the edge for follow on attacks.<br/><br/>That's my two cents.

It may not be his very best game design, but he also sets the bar pretty high.<br/><br/>I know it's wrong and bad and I should go to hell for it, but when things got boggy in our game, we decided to change the die size from d20 to d10s. The result was pretty much instant magic; you get more ties, which in turn results in a <b>lot</b> more successes for whichever side wins. Once we did this, players felt that they could use more successes for narrative effects rather than just inflicting Flesh Wounds all the time, which massively increased our enjoyment of the game and also reduced the time we spent in combat.<br/><br/>Another thing we figured out pretty early on is that it's more fun to fight a small number of powerful monsters than an equal or larger number of weak monsters. This is pretty much the opposite of D&amp;D and similar games and counter-intuitive at first, but the Law of Successes (if I'm not completely mistaken) allow you to quite effectively gang up on someone with even more drastic effects.<br/><br/>Curses are awesome. Whenever possible, use your successes (from magic or whatever) to decrease your opponents dice instead of increasing your own. It doesn't make you feel quite as awesome but results in more successes (returns diminish as the lower dice pool grows larger, especially if you're using larger die sizes).<br/><br/>If people have widely different Discernment values, the ones with lower Discernment will <b>hate</b> combat. If I have a Discernment of 2, and the three other members of my party have 4, and we fight two beasties with Discernment 5, then there are 24 actions in each flurry, of which I get a mere 2. Try to even this out or use one of the Initiative mod rules if you have to.<br/><br/>You're probably doing this already, but make <b>damn</b> sure you use the fact stating mechanics properly, especially with regards to the losing side narrating. We fell into bad habits and frequently let the winner narrate success, with disastrously boring results.<br/><br/>For a compilation of rule mods to consider, check <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6347" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6347</a>.<br/><br/>We had quite a bit of rule discussion during our game, trying to find solutions to some non-optimal play and certain tricky situations, and came to some good insights which may inspire you, <a href="http://www.hammergames.org/modules/newbb/viewforum.php?sortname=p.post_time&amp;sortorder=DESC&amp;since=0&amp;forum=14&amp;type=&amp;refresh=Go" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Donjon is a fun game, but you'll probably need to tweak it just a bit to get it just-right for you and your crew. The combat mechanics takes a fair bit of practice, not to comprehend, but for your group to figure out good strategies to speed up play. I strongly suggest trying a session with d10s instead of d20s, and if you run into further problems post them here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287114/#Comment_287114" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T07:05:49+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  7:05AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even in the face of Clinton's criticism, there's some serious awesome buried in Donjon.  <br/><br/>I had a dream about playing Donjon just a week or so ago.  In it, we'd jettisoned the stats -- just making minor mods to patch the holes that that left and it fixed all the problems!!!  I've been meaning to go back and reread it to see if that's just stupid or maybe a good start.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In my experience, no one wants to narrate more than one or two facts anyway, so you should just do that quickly and then either exploit or bank the remaining successes.  That can be pretty quick once you're moving along.  I haven't seen anyone quickly handle initiative and the long multi-action countdown...that seems to be the persistent problem in my games.<br/><br/>I don't remember: do damage-reduction abilities affect all kinds of damage?  Can you get around them by chopping up the monsters's stats first so that their roles are all gimped and <i>then</i> start inflicting flesh wounds?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287121/#Comment_287121" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T07:25:04+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  7:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            d10s instead of d20s is a great idea, and one that should pretty much always be used.

Donjon may not be awesome to you anymore, but it's definitely still awesome to the rest of us.<br/><br/>That said, rule tweaks are almost always welcome in any system, I think.

I had thought it would be a good segue for the guys, since we use mins in our D&amp;D campaigns.

In Donjon, the loser always gets narration - the winner only gets to state discrete <b>facts</b> about the situation which the loser must must must adhere to in their narration. Enforcing this rule, in addition to the switch to d10s, made this game sing much clearer for us.<br/><br/>Consider: Using my Sociality + Book of Scriptures, I'm preaching the word of the God of Doing Good Things in the town square, hoping that the frightened villagers will reveal to us the location of the cave where all the evil has been flowing out of despite the warlock's threats. Let's say I succeed with two successes. I use them to say "Okay, they reveal the location to us, and provide us with steeds to get there." Boring, right? But now the DM can say<blockquote>Okay, you notice the crowd is terrified of something, and several of them run away to their homes and shut their doors and windows. One of them heckle you, shouting 'You fools, the gibbertops will eat you alive!'. After your heated sermon, one of them approach you and tell you that the warlock has been threatening to burn down their village and feast on the blood of the virgins they've had to offer in sacrifice to him if they betray him. His cave complex is in the nearby mines - he draws you a crude map. He also gives you a few malnourished donkeys and an amulet he scavenged from a gibbertop he found dead in the woods one day. Just as you leave town, you hear the local sheriff forming a posse to capture you before you can bring doom on the village! Can you outrun the posse on your donkeys?</blockquote>\nMind you, we probably did a lot more of this out-of-Donjon play than most groups would, but had a lot of fun with the narrative back-and-forth. As a technique, it's very similar to "yes, and" and "no, but" techniques for creating interesting, consequential play you'll find elsewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287300/#Comment_287300" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T14:23:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  2:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>Maybe one day you could publish "Donjon 2.0," or "Advanced Donjon," or even "Donjons and Decahedrons," reflecting the change from d20s to d10s!</blockquote>No, OBVIOUSLY, if it's a paradigm shift from d20s to d10s, it MUST be called "World of Donjon."

In Donjon, the loser always gets narration - the winner only gets to state discrete facts </blockquote>\nOkay, I <i>knew </i>that...and yet thinking back, it does seem we were very lax in that regard. We sort of skipped out of town quickly to get to the adventure, and went pretty much straight into a battle. During the battle, I never actually <i>narrated </i>anything based on the others' facts during the battle. What little narration there was got shifted to the winner. So...if I can get my brain in gear for that paradigm shift, it would certainly make for a better gaming session!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288014/#Comment_288014" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-21T07:48:44+00:00" title="August 21, 2010  7:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite><br/>Maybe one day you could publish "Donjon 2.0," or "Advanced Donjon," or even "Donjons and Decahedrons," reflecting the change from d20s to d10s!</blockquote>\nSomeone already has, kind of. Check out Labyrinths and Lycanthropes, which takes the Donjon engine (streamlinging the stats and replacing the dice with cards), and adds a neat campaign creation tool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
