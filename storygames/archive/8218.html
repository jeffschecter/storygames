Four copies remained unsold by the end of the con, so we brought them back and we've put them <a href="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/cms.shop?categoryid=8" rel="nofollow">on sale on our website</a>.<br/><br/>If you buy this game (for \xa35), play it, and then get back to us with play reports, feedback, in-depth comments (you know the sort of thing), then you get playtester credit in the final book <i>and</i> \xa35 off the price of the full game when we publish it. (So the Ashcan is basically free if you like the game). If you don't get back to us, well you still get a full playable game for just \xa35.<br/><br/>Eekamouse in Atlantis is a funny and bittersweet game about Lost Toys and the adventures they have without their owners in the undersea city of Atlantis.<br/><br/>Learn more about the game at <a href="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/cms.eeks_about" rel="nofollow">http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/cms.eeks_about</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
