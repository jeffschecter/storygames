He's totally unconnected to the SG/RPG scene, knows zero lingo, but came up with the idea organically. When he brought up the idea, I said "Sure!" but everyone else at the table shook their head. When I asked why, they basically said (I'm making it much more articulate) that having the GM provides a sense of experiencing the unknown. They don't know what's behind a given door and there is a sense of mystery and discovery associated with that. If everyone is contributing on a GM level, the sense of mystery is lost to an extent because they have the opportunity to make the decision of what's behind that door, removing the excitement of discovery. It also instills a sense of unity among the players since the GM often takes a pseudo-adversarial role.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395626/#Comment_395626" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T15:33:16+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  3:33PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the benefits that having a singular creative vision rather than doing everything by committee and consensus and blah blah blah. <br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395628/#Comment_395628" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T16:06:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  4:06PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are definitely reasons for having a GM, as others have said. There are many enough that I can't compile it all into a pithy catchphrase, though.<br/><br/>One big reason that I've been rocking lately is that a singular GM is capable of holding and developing large secret developments in a way that is impossible or at least awkward (and thus requiring special systemic consideration) with shared GMing. Despite open scenarios having been a big trend in modern design over the last decade, there is still plenty of reason to go for secrets, too. It's the original purpose of having a GM, after all, historically speaking.<br/><br/>For extracurricular funkiness feel free to contrast and compare a GM with online chat play. The latter has the interesting property of making secret communication trivial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395633/#Comment_395633" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T16:54:37+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  4:54PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think secrets are overrated.

I think there is benefit when the players believe there is a myth even if the GM is just retro-patching.  The players don't get that illusion when the secrets are being generated by a system (like Dirty Secrets).<br/><br/>It is also possible to play Dirty Secrets outside the spirit of the rules (which suggest increasing the chance that a suspect the player thinks is guilty is named by the system as really being guilty) by just upping guilt chance of random characters.  That type of play breaks the illusion of secrets.<br/><br/>The example of secrets generated before play failing is not from a well functioning gaming group.  The GM strongly advocated for a game of The Laundry.  Other players were upset because they could not be awsome magic wielding mythos killer as GM implied they could be.  I was upset because my character's emational journey was ruled non-existant by the GM.<br/><br/>Anyway the GM was running us through published modules and after a few modules, I could figure out the format/writing style of the mysteries.  That enabled me to completely bypass the planned adventure and correctly identify the guilty person before we were supposed to.  So the GM continued the game for hours more until it was finally tte "right time" to reveal the former secret.<br/><br/>Again this isn't an example from a well functioning group.  The GM would deny positive results from successfil die rolls and give people successes on failed rolls (and that seemed to be part of railroad/pacing device).  But it does illustrate that the GM having secrets does not automatically generate an immersive myth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395669/#Comment_395669" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T04:46:41+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 4:47AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, given the perfect group described in the original post, which is impossible, authority is going to shake out in reasonable ways constantly.

that has nothing to do with turning them to a profit motive.<br/><br/>You have an excuse to wallow in research on stuff that interests you, do all kinds of cool little arts'n'crafts projects if that's your thing, write snippets of story ideas but never have to actually refine or re-write them if you don't feel like it, play-act at being maybe a dozen different characters or more in quick succession without worrying about their success or failure in the fiction, and you get to invite your pals to come join a verbal-costume dress up party where you've picked the themes and the party

Without having to manage a supporting cast or parts of the narrative that do not come from the characters thoughts and actions. It can be rather immersive if you can just act and react as that one person in the game world.<br/>Also some genres and styles of stories can benefit from a single "author" guiding it and having a plan beforehand or all the power to make certain decisions. Horrorgames for example. I often find it easier to scare people as a GM than as a player sharing authority and discussing how the horrific element works. Also it seems easier to be scared when I am a character and do not have to think about how to creep out the others with the story. Pacing sometimes is easier too when there is a guiding hand and for the horror genre that is important as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395695/#Comment_395695" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T08:29:21+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  8:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 8:29AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ain't this is supposed to be a thread about why GM'd games are good? Please don't turn it into a discussion about why GM'd games are bad or why GMless games are better. There are a million other threads dedicated to that. <br/><br/>The "perfect gaming group" mentioned in the OP is indeed impossible, but it was a hypothetical establishment meant to thwart the inevitable "GM's are cheaters" argument, so don't get hung up on that.<br/><br/>Personally, another reason I GM is because...well... If I didn't GM, we probably would never actually play a game at all. My current group of players enjoy Story Games and RPGs, but they aren't tabletop gamers by heart and don't have the enthusiasm level to spend $40 on a book or spend ten hours learning a game and preparing a session. <br/><br/>Games that feature a GM can sometimes work better for introducing games to people who have never role-played before since the GM usually takes on the responsibility of host and instructor for the game. Sometimes there is really only one enthusiastic person with the time and money to invest in a game to get things going and introduce it to fledgling gamers. I've hosted more than a few game sessions with brand new players who then went out and bought the game shortly after. If I had not hosted the game, taught them how to play, and invested the time necessary to prepare, they probably never would have found an interest in the hobby. This could be accomplished with GMless games as well, but I personally have found a good level of synergy with the roles of Host and GM coupled together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395700/#Comment_395700" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T09:13:46+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  9:13AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know players who either don't like being a GM or prefer a GM so they have a concrete antagonist to defeat and "win".<br/><br/>Not trying to bash GMs, in general, I was just trying to say that I don't understand how "secret keeper" can be a positve GM role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395720/#Comment_395720" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T11:46:42+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 11:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When your character solves a GM-led mystery, you, the player, have actually solved a real mystery, not just made it up as you went along or invented an explanation for an ending reached randomly (Dirty Secrets).                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395734/#Comment_395734" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T12:42:47+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 12:42PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I as a player realize the method the GM or scenario writer used to generate a mystery, I have 0 immersion.

In other words, you're saying that because you haven't seen and can't imagine how something works, this means that it can't work. Obviously everybody who's seen it work will attempt to correct you.<br/><br/>Like, just now, you told Jason there that it's impossible for a GM to possess a mystery that is genuinely solved by players. And the only way to have a real mystery would be by relying on real criminology, because apparently mysteries can only be criminal in nature, and there can't be mysteries outside the detective genre. And real mysteries are dull anyway because they can usually be solved by routine police-work.<br/><br/>Going by this logic I am apparently either deluded or lying when I tell you that our D&amp;D campaign relies heavily on asymmetrical information wielded by the GM, and this information routinely manifests in play as mysteries the players attempt to solve. The information is objective, often coming from meticulously pre-written adventure modules, and the GM's task is to present it into play realistically, according to what the players declare they are doing. Failures in investigation often leave the adventuring party in dire straits, like the time they failed to figure out the identity of the pod-person in advance and the traitorous creature caused a cave-in, trapping the party underground. Other times players succeed and gain the gratitude of the city by e.g. cathing the magical serial killer that's been haunting it.<br/><br/>Insofar as it matters, in our campaign it's totally kosher for players to read the GM's or module-writer's mind and cut the mystery short with their telepathic powers. Great for you if you can do that, means that you're an excellent player ready for more difficult challenges; there's no required optimal length of time you need to sit on your ass before you're allowed to solve the mystery. Often the ability of players to solve mysteries in this way end up limited by the fiction, though; for example, in the cave-in adventure above the players totally pegged the right culprit almost immediately upon coming to the scene, before there even was any clear indication that this was a mystery adventure, but they were forced to admit that they had no feasible method to do anything about it right then. Or rather, perhaps they weren't certain enough to just attack and slay the guy on the spot; after all, suspecting that he was guilty didn't equal knowing that he wasn't human underneath, or knowing why he was guilty and in what way, exactly.<br/><br/>It's close to off-topic, yes, but I'd like to have it on record that actual empirical observation of the world tells us that GMs can be utilized as keepers of secrets in a fruitful way that has nothing to do with mitigating incompetent players. Our D&amp;D campaign, for instance, is not the way it is because the players are somehow incompetent and incapable of playing higher forms of games; these are some of the same people who've played the entire range of Forge-related games with me over the last decade, voluntarily playing some D&amp;D for a change because it's a fresh and different approach to putting a game together.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395756/#Comment_395756" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T14:57:20+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  2:57PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having a GM is very useful when the players aren't singing quite so perfectly from the same hymn sheet, especially if she or he is skilled in group dynamics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395760/#Comment_395760" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T15:23:45+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  3:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my stance on secrets is getting resistance is because I didn't sleep much last night and haven't been as clear as I should have been.

Harkening back to the premise of the thread, we're discussing reasons to have a GM even given perfect cooperation among the play group. One possible reason indeed is that you might select a GM because one player in the group has more time and interest to prepare for the game than others. Perhaps that player is more intelligent and has a better memory, which makes him a natural GM figure. This seems like it would be a pretty common practical reason to choose a specific person as a GM among a group, in fact.<br/><br/>In general I doubt that we can name <i>one</i> reason to have a GM if we require this reason to be true over the entire set of possible roleplaying games and all possible groups. No universal applicability should be required when discussing possibilities. Thus it is entirely fair to say that even if not all games need or want GM-kept mysteries, some do, and therefore GM-kept mysteries are a fair example of an useful technique that is achieved by introducing a GM-like role into the game. And it's not really a counter-argument at all that there exists a game called <i>Dirty Secrets</i> that has mysteries but does not have a GM.<br/><br/>I feel that this entire side discussion would be pre-empted by the use of simple predicate logic. It seems to me that Aaron is saying things with the '\u2200' predicate when he means '\u2203' and vice versa <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395769/#Comment_395769" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T16:30:22+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:30PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 4:32PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm a fan of evolving threads, usually; but since Zachary is still interested in gleaning more answers to the original topic, and I'm pretty well satisfied already, I hereby bequeath the thread to him.

I'll bow out happily <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<blockquote>In general I doubt that we can name <i>one</i> reason to have a GM if we require this reason to be true over the entire set of possible roleplaying games and all possible groups. No universal applicability should be required when discussing possibilities. Thus it is entirely fair to say that even if not all games need or want GM-kept mysteries, some do, and therefore GM-kept mysteries are a fair example of an useful technique that is achieved by introducing a GM-like role into the game. And it's not really a counter-argument at all that there exists a game called <i>Dirty Secrets</i> that has mysteries but does not have a GM.</blockquote>\nCouldn't have said it better.\n<blockquote>I think my stance on secrets is getting resistance is because I didn't sleep much last night and haven't been as clear as I should have been.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I wasn't resisting your opinion so much as resisting a change in topic.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395771/#Comment_395771" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T16:35:30+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:35PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem is not that Dirty Secrets has mysteries.

There's absolutely nothing about your group or game that could use mitigating by the presence of a GM.<br/><br/>Why might you want one <i>anyway</i>?</blockquote>\nThat is, why one <i>might</i> wish to have a GM. This is inherently a task of speculative mapping, figuring out different reasons for why a game designer might decide to create a game with a GM-like role even when he is not concerned with group coordination and leadership. Obviously some of these reasons will be more or less important for individual designers, but I had the impression that Burr wanted a plurality of alternatives, not a single answer.<br/><br/>The opposite question of what features are shared between <i>all</i> valid GM-roles is a bit more obscure, it feels to me. I mean, it seems to me that to answer that we'd need to actually create an analytical definition of what a GM <i>is</i>, to even begin. Also, to disprove any single claim for this question it would be sufficient to cite a game that has a GM but does not utilize the role for the given function. For example, you suggest that providing antagonism could be part of the minimal universal GM role; however, how about a game like <i>Amber</i> where the players are supposed to provide antagonism for each other while the GM is a neutral arbiter? A group playing Amber (the default scenario, anyway) probably doesn't want a GM who provides antagonism.<br/><br/>Regardless, I don't mind either phrasing of the question as long as we're clear on what we're discussing. I do, obviously, agree that there are games and gaming groups that do not want to play a game where the GM is the gate-keeper of truth. Thus having GM-kept mysteries cannot be an universal feature of the gamemaster's role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395776/#Comment_395776" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T17:25:32+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  5:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe the answer I was looking for is that the GM does things that the players don't want to do.<br/><br/>And the answer to the other reading of the question will be a list of things a GM can do.<br/><br/>I tend to GM.

That meant I didn't game at all for several years, but I do not regret that decision because it was a huge contributing factor to nearly burning out on the hobby entirely.

Juggling on the fly with all the already defined data points and the introductions of new elements by other players can be taxing, but I personally find it incredibly fun.<br/><br/>As a character player, having a GM brings a different dynamic: in GM-less games you tend to be in a collective exercise in definition (at least in my experience), with a GM, it's exploration (or the semblance of it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397446/#Comment_397446" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T04:28:20+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  4:28AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because often, stuff one person makes up over a long period is better than stuff you make up in seconds in a GMless game.<br/>It goes hand-in-hand with immersive, black box play. You get a description of what's going on around you from a single consistent source rather than switching head space to make stuff up. I like the feeling of team solidarity and common cause a player/GM setting can give.<br/><br/>I really noticed this last weekend at IndieCon; I played one GM-strong game (Fear Itself) with meticulously researched background and prepped characters, two GM-light games (DramaSystem) and the rest were all co-GM make stuff up. They were all fun, but the first was a very different experience of acting in character with the other players in character, too. And this is from a player point of view - running a game as GM which goes well is an RPG experience like no other.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397530/#Comment_397530" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T16:08:45+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  4:08PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on what the jobs and tasks of a GM are.<br/><br/>If it's no different, there is no point.
