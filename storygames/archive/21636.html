He has a climbing stat of level 5 and the GM determines that climbing the wall has a difficulty of 3. John tosses (5-3+1 = ) 3 coins and requires a single head to succeed. Albert tries to hit Bob. He has a hitting stat of level 5 and Bob a not-getting-hitted stat of level 6 so Albert tosses (6-5+1 = ) 2 coins and will succeed only if both of them show heads.</i><br/><br/>Although the description implies 2 separate cases, <b>the system is completely symmetric</b> (<i>making the toss from the Y point of view yields the same success/fail probabilities for both characters</i>). Moreover, <b>these probabilities don't depend on the individual values of X or Y but just on their absolute difference</b> (i.e. <i>30 vs 33</i> is equivalent to <i>26 vs 29</i> which is equivalent to <i>-104 vs -101</i>) allowing an <b>infinite stat-range in both directions</b> which works very well with logarithmic ability scales like the ones used in DC Heroes, Underground, Blood of Heroes, TORG or ARM (but as far as I know there isn't any game that uses both, a logarithmic scale and this coin-based exponential resolution mechanic).\n<pre><code> Y \\ X |     1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |     5     |<br/>-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+<br/>   1   | 50% \\ 50% | 25% \\ 75% | 12% \\ 87% |  6% \\ 94% |  3% \\ 97% |<br/>-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+<br/>   2   | 75% \\ 25% | 50% \\ 50% | 25% \\ 75% | 12% \\ 87% |  6% \\ 94% |<br/>-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+<br/>   3   | 87% \\ 12% | 75% \\ 25% | 50% \\ 50% | 25% \\ 75% | 12% \\ 87% |<br/>-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+<br/>   4   | 94% \\  6% | 87% \\ 12% | 75% \\ 25% | 50% \\ 50% | 25% \\ 75% |<br/>-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+<br/>   5   | 97% \\  3% | 94% \\  6% | 87% \\ 12% | 75% \\ 25% | 50% \\ 50% |<br/>-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+</code></pre>\nApart from the symmetry and the fact that the system relies just on the absolute stat-difference, this system has three additional properties that must be noted: <br/><br/>1) <b>Equally leveled characters have a 50%-50% success probability</b> (which seems quite natural).<br/><br/>2) <b>There are no ties</b> (the character either succeeds or fails).<br/><br/>3) Even though the odds of beating a strong opposition quickly decay as the level-difference increases (more precisely, for each additional level that your opposition gains your probability of success gets halved), <b>there are no impossible (or sure) tasks</b>.<br/><br/>The latter property means that, although a +1 bonus always provides the same "increase" in power (think, again, in logarithmic scales like the one of DC Heroes, where a +1 bonus makes you twice as strong) there is a natural "diminishing returns" effect built in the system which makes irrelevant such bonus when there is a big level difference between characters: A +1 bonus in a 5 vs 5 conflict is huge whereas this same +1 bonus in a 5 vs 15 conflict means practically nothing but, again, this does not depend on your raw ability score (i.e. 5) but on your score difference (i.e. 5-5 vs 5-15) which is quite natural if you think about it.<br/><br/>Another useful property of the system is that all conflicts are resolved using the same system whether they have an active or a passive opposition. This means that both, <b>difficulties and stats are measured in the same scale</b>, which reduces the task of eyeballing the difficulty of a task to answering the following question: <i>which ability level represents a 50% chance of success in this task?</i><br/><br/>Finally, coins are pretty ubiquitous but they are a pain in the ass to toss in general so you can use other "binary" randomizer instead (like odd-even or high-low in any even-sided dice). Fortunately, the nature of the system requires the minimum number of coins in every situation (a conflict between a character of level 120 and a character of level 127 requires tossing "just" 8 coins) and the quickly decreasing probability of success for really unbalanced conflicts makes it difficult to think about tossing more than 10 coins at any given time.<br/><br/><br/>Now, my questions:<br/><br/>* <b>Do you know about any RPG that uses this resolution mechanic?</b> (So far I've found just one: a Spanish zombie RPG called <i>Carne Fresca</i>)<br/>* <b>Do you like this resolution mechanic? Do you think that it can be used in practice?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473306/#Comment_473306" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T15:42:33+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  3:42PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure I grok the mechanic completely but Prince Valiant and Hollow Earth Expeditions are both coin pool systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473307/#Comment_473307" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T15:43:52+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  3:43PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prince Valiant would be the closest game I can think of.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" title="CarlosLuna"><img alt="CarlosLuna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/043/n8G0MTMMVZLJN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">CarlosLuna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473309/#Comment_473309" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T15:55:59+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  3:55PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the replies but both games set the difficulty by asking for more or less "heads" in your toss rather than modifying the number of coins that you toss:<br/><br/><b>CES:</b> Toss <i>|Ability-Difficulty|+1</i> coins and get a success with <i>1</i> head (or <i>all</i> heads, depending on the case).<br/><br/><b>Prince Valiant / Ubiquity System:</b> Toss <i>Ability</i> coins and get a success with <i>Difficulty</i> heads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473310/#Comment_473310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T16:04:16+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  4:04PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My interpretation and another explanation, correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Everything has a rating from -inf to inf.

The original mechanic was a bunch of dice all hitting one side of the split, like 4-6 on a d6. Or heads on a d2. Here, let's say no one's the underdog - flip a coin, however you like. Let's say you're the underdog by 1 - then roll 2d6, looking for (3-6) and (3-6), happens (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 of the time, or 44.4%. If you're the underdog by 2, roll 3d6, looking for (3-6) to happen all three times, or (2/3)*(2/3)*(2/3)=(2/3)^3=8/27=29.6%.<br/>(2/3)^4 ~= 20%<br/>(2/3)^5 ~= 13%<br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473349/#Comment_473349" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T20:32:12+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  8:32PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Guy! That's what I thought you meant, but the rounding threw me. Excellent!<br/><br/>I used to have a Fudge version of this - it has many of the same features this mechanic describes (and could even be replicated with coins, if you want).<br/><br/>I called it "*dF".<br/><br/>Basically, you each have a level. (Numbers or words, it doesn't matter.) Then one side (or both; you could set it up either way) rolls a Fudge die (+, 0 , -). Whatever result comes up, it counts, and you can keep rolling. If your next roll matches it, that one counts, too. Keep going until you get a result which doesn't match.<br/><br/>For instance, you have a Stat of 3. You roll a Fudge die and get a [+]. You're up to 4! Now you roll again, hoping to match that. Another [+]? Add it to the pile: You're at a 5! Next roll comes up with something else, though - a [-] or a [0], so we ignore it and you're done: You have two {+} dice on the table and a starting Stat of 3, so your outcome is a 5.<br/><br/>(Oh, there's one feature of the mechanic being described here that it DOESN'T replicate: you can have a tie. That's a nice feature. I suppose, in my Fudge version - which, again, could be done just as easily with coins - you'd have to arrange a tiebreaker, like highest stat wins or best roll wins; I liked ties for the purpose of the game I was using, so it was never an issue.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna" title="CarlosLuna"><img alt="CarlosLuna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/043/n8G0MTMMVZLJN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarlosLuna">CarlosLuna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473353/#Comment_473353" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-04T20:50:01+00:00" title="May  4, 2018  8:50PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Things I don't like:<br/><br/>1.

In practice I use a set of special D6s that I found in a educational store: They have 3 faces showing a plus symbol and 3 faces showing a minus symbol. It isn't really difficult now a days to find some kind of "binary dice".<br/><br/>This being said, the Coin Exponential System is designed so you have to toss the minimum number of coins able to "represent" the difference of skill. This means that it is really rare to toss more than, say, 6 coins at the same time and, even if the skill difference is as huge as 35, you can toss the coins in groups of 4 or 5 and stop as soon as one of them shows a head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
