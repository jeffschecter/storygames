I made a system for creative challenges many years ago and we decided to playtest it at a con. Problem is, there were only three of us, which felt like too few, so I hacked it into a GMless co-op game on the spot. And it rocked. Oh, how it rocked.<br/><br/>The game got played again and again at different cons in Sweden and was repeatedly the most played game in the Indie Room. People asked me to write it down, and my lazy answer was always "Yeah, I'll totally do that later, promise." Years later Jonatan Kilhamn wrote down an English version of the game for a Story-Games Christmas exchange or somesuch. But alas! he had misremembered some parts and the result was flawed! Another year or two passed, and finally Rickard Elim\xe4\xe4 asked me if I could send him the document, and I did, mentioning the errors in it. He took it upon him to correct the errors and made a great layout of the game. This game is now finally available for your enjoyment!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>What's it like? It's a cooperative GMless game where the players team up to beat the dungeon. It incorporates short-term tactical risk management (how much Trouble am I willing to risk on this roll?) as well as long-term strategic resource management (should I burn my Spotlight Banana now or should I save it for later?). But the core of the game is the creative challenges it poses the players. How do you get past the guards using your Fancy Hat and Impressive Climbing Skills, and how to you get injured in the process? How to you escape from the Zorgon warship using your Alien Artifact and your Psychic Powers? These kinds of creative challenges are super fun to meet and just as much fun to listen to.<br/><br/>This is also a great game to play with children. I've played this with 8-12 year olds and had a blast, and I don't even like children! Their creativity will astound you and they'll have a heck of a time, too.<br/><br/>So go on, you know you want to read and then play this. It's super fun, and it's the only one of my totally famous games to be available in English, so seize the opportunity! The king of Sweden and also ABBA totally love this game, too, seriously. Time traveling Alfred Nobel said it was "Totally rad" and gave it 5/5 sticks of dynamite.<br/><br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/dungeonsAndBananasUSLetter.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://erebaltor.se/rickard/dungeonsAndBananasUSLetter.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449465/#Comment_449465" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-14T13:01:44+00:00" title="November 14, 2015  1:01PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, tell me if things are unclear.

You always play the last challenge, so if you roll to pass it, you stop there.\n<blockquote>If I get 1 trouble on a 1, do I roll d6 and we move to the location that many down the list? Or choose? Or +1? Or is it just color without actually moving on the place list?</blockquote>\nIt's just color. All the results on the "1" list, except the last one, are without mechanical effect. The parts in regular text is the color, what you need to weave into your description, and the parts in italics describe the mechanical effects. All reluts on the "1" list except the last one, as well as all "1" results on the other lists except for list number 2, have only color and no mechanical effects.\n<blockquote>Is buying a new item only for other people? By the phrasing I can't tell if it's "buy anyone an item" or "buy anyone but yourself an item".</blockquote>\nIt's "buy anyone but yourself". You can only buy new items and unlock items and abilities for other people. You can never spend your stones on yourself.\n<blockquote>It looks like each player must take exactly one turn, not more or less, during each full round, though a completed or failed challenge may cut off a round. Is that right?</blockquote>\nYes, that's right. Turns to face the challenge can be taken in any order, but nobody can take two turns in the same "round", and when everyone has taken a turn, you add some new stones to the Trouble pile and describe a change to the challenge.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Thanks for your questions.

It's a lot of fun to make up weird items for each other, and it helps with the Czege principle when I go "Ok, so after defeating the dragon, you take one of its teeth as a souvenir, worth 3. Let's see how you make use of that in the next challenge!". I make up an item and you have to think of ways it can be useful in meeting the challenges. It also helps avoiding feedback loops where I'm successful, giving me more points, which gives me better items, which makes me even more successful. Spending your points on others helps spread the efficiency around, especially since you tend to go "Alright, who doesn't have a +4 item yet?

Strange grammar here, I don't understand.</blockquote>\nThat should probably be "if", not "of". If the trouble pile limit is exceeded, the challenge is lost. We should also emphasise more that this happens even if you empty the challenge pile in the same roll, and that the stones earned in that roll are discarded (but stones earned in previous rolls in the challenge are kept).\n<blockquote>b) question:<br/>I'm unclear on what happens when you lose a challenge for the third time. You lose the adventure and thus lose your character. But then you move on to a new challenge? That means you try to tackle the adventure again with the same challenges?

Everyone's dead, you lost the game. If you want to, you can start again, but with new characters. You can try the same dungeon again, or you can make a new one, as you prefer. Or you can admit defeat and play another game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449720/#Comment_449720" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-23T21:43:07+00:00" title="November 23, 2015  9:43PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played the temple of the gorilla god.

As you note, changing the nature of the challenge is important in avoiding the challenges getting stale. A playmat in the middle might help. Not sure if I'll make one of those, though. We'll see! It took a lot of time to get this much done, after all. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>3.

There's a fair bit of tactics involved, and playing it with experienced board gamers or people who have played it a few times, you can often raise the stakes a bit. The standard way of doing this is tackling a longer dungeon, but since that also makes the game take longer, there are other variables to play with, like the Trouble Limit or the amount of extra stones added to the Challenge Pile each round. I've toyed with the idea of making different difficulty levels or a point system which would incentivize keeping as many stones unspent as possible, but nothing has come of it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449733/#Comment_449733" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-24T20:56:52+00:00" title="November 24, 2015  8:56PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2015 9:02PM by Rickard.">edited November 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>5.

My only weakness!<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I suspect I've been playing it like this, with all misses generating Trouble. It doesn't necessarily force you to use your Spotligt Banana. If you're not in a tight spot, you can just not roll that many blue dice. Not a big deal. And of course, sometimes you WANT Trouble, if you're at the end of a challenge and have a long way left before you hit the limit.

Nobody played before, and we've been trying new systems lately. This was the first game all our players got excited about during play. It shines! <br/><br/>We started with a high fantasy tune, escorting a young prince through dangers to reclaim his throne. As we were unfamiliar with the maths at first we used waay to many blue dice and lost our first two challenges (one involvig fighting off huge birds attacking out hot-air balloon and the other about surviving in the harsh mountains after the crash land). We decided to start over and travel around a mythic Europe in search of the Holy Grail. We lost the final challenge in a forgotten tepmle of Solomon against Cain himself. The game was working fabulous, but we had some minor issues here and there. <br/><br/>There were five of us, and sometimes it felt flat that five different people had to act in basically the same situation in a challenge. There were multiple attempts to avoid this, one "gm" effectively changing the challenge after each roll, we were urging others to change the situation ourselves and such. However, after the fact, I think the best way to handle this would have been to lower the round limit to four or three. Like a round ends after four people have rolled, raising the trouble limit only by four, and the fifth person starting next round. <br/><br/>Maybe is was beacuse of our overcompensation on the liberal use of blue dice in the first adventure, but the trouble list was not used that often. Even when it came in to play, only trouble ratings of one or two were used, and these were not adding much pressure. We got through the challenges without risking a lot. Might have been a bit of a lucky string of rolls, though.<br/><br/>We found the rule that you give stuff only to others wonderful to spark interest in each other's characters, however this was kinda lost during a challenge. I felt that some link or pressure was missing in connecting the actions of one player to the next's. It's like the actual actions and circumstances did not count that much if we were lazy. We were certainly tired at the end of the session, but i felt that some nudge or an arrow in the mechanics would have been nice. I'm thinking of a combo rule or similar, but then again, I have no idea on how can this be put seamlessly into the system.<br/><br/>All in all, a great game. It will be our go-to game when nobody feels like GMing for a whole night.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/way" title="way"><img alt="way" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/way">way</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449816/#Comment_449816" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-30T08:28:05+00:00" title="November 30, 2015  8:28AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On further reflection, why would anyone want blue dice?

That gives you half a stone. It costs one stone to buy it back. Blue dice will always give you a stone, no matter if it's a success or a miss (since, as Rickard points out, Trouble still gives you XP). You need blue dice to be able to afford the yellow dice.<br/><br/>Additionally, since the Trouble Lists get worse the higher you go, you want to spread out your Trouble as evenly as possible, so you don't risk the higher levels.

Five players is a bit much; the game works best with three or four. Setting shorter rounds is a nice way to limit this problem. The issue is with turns taking. You can no longer have a rule that everyone gets to act once before anyone can act again, since it'll be super confusing to do this. But maybe one can just leave the spotlight sharing up to the players.\n<blockquote>Maybe is was beacuse of our overcompensation on the liberal use of blue dice in the first adventure, but the trouble list was not used that often. Even when it came in to play, only trouble ratings of one or two were used, and these were not adding much pressure. We got through the challenges without risking a lot. Might have been a bit of a lucky string of rolls, though.</blockquote>\nA good tactic is to risk more than you need in the easy challenges in the beginning, to get your Trouble closer to the limit, which will give you more stones to spend on buying better stuff. As the challenges get more difficult, you might need that stuff. You lost the last challenge, after all, so maybe you should have saved up some more in the early challenges! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>We found the rule that you give stuff only to others wonderful to spark interest in each other's characters, however this was kinda lost during a challenge. I felt that some link or pressure was missing in connecting the actions of one player to the next's. It's like the actual actions and circumstances did not count that much if we were lazy. We were certainly tired at the end of the session, but i felt that some nudge or an arrow in the mechanics would have been nice. I'm thinking of a combo rule or similar, but then again, I have no idea on how can this be put seamlessly into the system.</blockquote>\nThere used to be a combo rule called "Temporary bananas". Instead of winning those stones you earn after a successful roll, you could spend them straight away to say stuff like "Now there's a ledge to step on!" or "Now the crocoldiles are distracted!". The next player could then use this fact in their own description and earn these stones as dice to be used only once. The idea was that this was worse than waiting until the end, since you couldn't re-activate these things. In the end I scrapped that part, since it made the final challenges too easy.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449835/#Comment_449835" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-01T08:33:00+00:00" title="December  1, 2015  8:33AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Finally got a chance to look at this.

"It's like nothing you did mattered" followed by "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH".<br/><br/>It was a blast. Three players, classic dungeon-delving fantasy "everything that can go wrong will". No rules problems or questions this time. Just other problems, like losing our first +4, rolling an early high number on the +challenge die, and losing 2 challenges before getting to the final challenge.<br/><br/>Some wacky bits: our cleric sunk Atlantis in the past by winning a legalize argument with the Lords of Time about Atlantean reverse compound interest, thus also getting said Lords to retrieve and bless my lost axe. Our shapeshifter turned into a bird, flew above the baddie, then turned into a bull. Confused, I welded a bunch of bones randomly to other bones so when the skeletons tried to reanimate it took way too much power and the ritual/whatever-it-was fizzled. Our patron ran away at the Inn - we followed a false lead to the bottomless chasm - we followed a false lead to the illusory halls - our patron finally found us again, wondering where we had run off to, just before the sleeping king was going to awake. Our shapeshifter couldn't seem to disbelieve the illusory owlbear mauling him, so the cleric removed the problem - the shapeshifter's consciousness - with a blackjack. Like he did to me earlier to stop my bloodlust. "Blackjack of Practicality +4".<br/><br/>Aaaactually, there was one rules question.\n<blockquote>If the trouble pile limit is exceeded, the challenge is lost.

Both are filled up new new stones for every new dungeon. Each roll gives the stones <i>from both piles</i> to the participant who rolled.<br/><br/>1. If the trouble pile is cleared, the challenge is lost.<br/>2.

Counting to see what's left all the time was just not gonna happen. I'm definitely in favor of making that explicit. But removing trouble from a large stack of trouble doesn't sound like "trouble" it sounds like "yay we're winning, the large stack of trouble is diminishing".<br/><br/>If the condition changes to "if empty" the limit (pile size) should be upped by 1. I've lost 2/2, the game must already be hard enough! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I think getting your own trouble stones on your turn requires playtesting. There were definitely challenges where someone got very few stones but felt okay during buying phase because 1-2 challenge stones plus 3-4 trouble stones is plenty to feel like you're doing something, while just 1-2 challenge stones might not be.<br/><br/>I dunno, I liked character creation without having any idea how to use them. It seems kind of hard to go wrong considering what your fellow players will throw at you later... and keeping the size of the rules down as much as possible is a huge win, that's why we decided to play the second time rather than choose a different game for that night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449881/#Comment_449881" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T03:40:27+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  3:40AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2015 4:11AM by Rickard.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I dunno, I liked character creation without having any idea how to use them.</blockquote>\nI described how to write the game for the reader, not how to play the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449882/#Comment_449882" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-04T04:12:58+00:00" title="December  4, 2015  4:12AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the traditional RPG convention of placing character creation first, while it does have its positives, is a really good thing to challenge.

When Trouble is generated, I pass stones from the first pile into the second. When aquired Trouble is spent at the end of the challenge, they are returned to the first pile. This means it's not "distributed", but rather spent collectively, which is how I play it.<br/><br/>You could also solve it by using markers of two different colors. That way it's easy to see which stone goes where when it's spent, even if the Trouble is "personal".<br/><br/>Regarding the difficulty level, there are of course many variables to tweak to adjust it. One could play a shorter dungeon or change the rules for adding stones to the challenge pile, for example. Here are some strategy tips:<br/><br/>* Try to roll blue dice evenly. Not too many, not too few. Rolling many at once is really dangerous, but you need to roll them.<br/>* When you're using a Spotlight Banana, roll some extra blue dice; they're less dangerous now.<br/>* Lots of weak items are generally less effective than few powerful ones, since only one can be used at a time. Sometimes it might not be worth the stones to reactivate weaker items. Few powerful items are at risk of getting lost or damaged, though, so don't put all your eggs in one basket.<br/>* Winning a challenge with a large margin is not necessarily a good thing. Try to collect a decent chunk of the Trouble you can afford (in small doses). If things are going really well, it might be worth it to use your weaker items and abilities to increase the Trouble before winning the challenge, since you get to spend that Trouble as XP after the challenge is over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450181/#Comment_450181" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-26T03:22:51+00:00" title="December 26, 2015  3:22AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2015 4:06AM by Hasimir.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, gonna play this in a few hours and I'm having some doubts! &gt;_&lt;<br/><br/>1)<br/>When you FAIL a Challenge everyone is forced to immediately spend their personal reserve of stones?<br/><br/>2)<br/>When creating a character you have 3 traits with a rating 1-2-3 AND ALSO one Spotlight Banana trait.<br/>The Banana is a 4th trait with no rating?<br/>Or the Banana is one of the previous traits?<br/>Can you buy a rating for a Banana trait?<br/><br/>3)<br/>What does UNLOCKING mean?<br/>When I use Traits and Items I MARK them... and with stones I can UNMARK them.<br/>With stones I can also BUY new ITEMS for other people.<br/>So what does UNLOCK mean?<br/><br/>4)<br/>I can BUY items for other people.<br/>I can UNMARK my own Items and Traits.<br/>Can I UNMARK someone else's stuff?<br/><br/>5)<br/>The rules say "<i>Marking the spotlight banana supersedes the effects on table 3 and 6 during that roll</i>"<br/>So... just to be sure... under the effects of Damage I should roll 1-4/5-6 but if I use the Banana I roll 1-2/3-6 ... not a rebalanced 1-3/4-6 ... right?<br/><br/>6)<br/>Table 5 "It Turns Out" is meant to reduce the successes rolled, but as it is now it actually HELPS if a player is also Damaged/South.<br/>By ignoring the <b>successes from the top</b> this effect can be fixed with no double negatives...<br/>1 - color<br/>2 - ignore successes at 6<br/>3 - ignore successes at 5 and 6<br/>4 - ignore successes at 4 and 5 and 6<br/>5 - ignore all successes and end the round<br/><br/>Would this work or did I misunderstood it all?

For those of you who have played both games, could the Blue dice be assigned in the same way in Dungeons &amp; Bananas?<br/><br/>* The current player can say how what they are doing is dangerous, and add a small number of Danger dice to his/her roll.<br/>* Each other player can add another detail about why what they are doing is dangerous, and add an additional die. (For this game, maybe it could be one or two dice?)<br/>* The labeling of the dice as "danger" gives the players a creative prompt for their narrated details.<br/>* This encourages the players to think as a group as they take turns.<br/><br/>Would that work here, or not? (And, if it sounds like a great idea, what kind of range of dice is good for the game? Does the number of blue dice to use tend to fall into a certain range, or is a very wide range important for the game?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450197/#Comment_450197" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-28T03:38:49+00:00" title="December 28, 2015  3:38AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another question:<br/><br/>How important is the unpredictable number of challenges before reaching the end of the adventure?<br/><br/>If I were to make a deck of cards, each with a scene/location, and shuffled them and then played through them in the order the turn up, would that harm the design of the game in some way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450199/#Comment_450199" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-28T07:47:49+00:00" title="December 28, 2015  7:47AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Blue dice in this game are very similar to Danger dice in the game "Danger Patrol". For those of you who have played both games, could the Blue dice be assigned in the same way in Dungeons &amp; Bananas?</blockquote>\nProbably. The number of blue dice you want to roll might vary a bit more than in DP. Sometimes you don't want to roll any blue dice (when you're close to the Trouble Limit), and sometimes you might want to roll loads (when you're using a Spotlight Banana). Also, there might be a risk of getting too much input to include in one's description? As is, a typical narration will include the challenge faced, the attribute and item used and the result of the Trouble Table. That's four separate pieces of information. I'm a bit concerned that if you pile on three more on player input, it'd make it difficult and tedious to narrate it all. But that might not be a big issue. You could try it and see how it goes.\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nThe basic math is: A yellow die earns you half a stone back, and costs you one stone to unmark again. A blue die earns you one stone back and costs nothing. So the basic break-even roll would include half as many blue dice as yellow. But that's complicated by a number of factors:<br/><br/>* You always roll the red die, which works just like a blue one.<br/>* When you use your Spotlight, yellow dice will earn 2/3 of a stone, and blue dice will be less dangerous so you'll want to roll more of them.<br/>* The challenges get increasingly difficult, so you'll want to earn some extra stones to keep up.<br/>* If a challenge is lost, the blue dice rolled will only earn back half a stone on average.<br/><br/>The challenge of the game largely consists of deciding how many blue dice to roll, and this will vary depending on the above factors. But on average, I'd say slightly more than half the number of yellow dice, so maybe two or three blue dice per roll. But the range is considerably larger. You'll sometimes want to roll zero blue dice, and I've seen rolls of up to seven or eight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450200/#Comment_450200" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-28T07:49:29+00:00" title="December 28, 2015  7:49AM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another question:<br/><br/>How important is the unpredictable number of challenges before reaching the end of the adventure?<br/><br/>If I were to make a deck of cards, each with a scene/location, and shuffled them and then played through them in the order the turn up, would that harm the design of the game in some way?</blockquote>\nIt's not important. I've done a similar thing, and it works fine. It removes some of the randomness from the game, which might be a good or a bad thing, depending on your preferences. Just divide the number of challenges by 3.5 to get the same difficulty level.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450210/#Comment_450210" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-28T17:48:37+00:00" title="December 28, 2015  5:48PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2015 10:01PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Simon.

Any particular tips for making it more fun? (Things to do vs. things not to do.)<br/>2. Each "dungeon" could be made into a map. You move a figurine representing the heroes along the map, like a boardgame. Kids would like that, I think. (And illustrations could be used for inspiration.)<br/>3. Is there any reason players can't assign other characters new Traits? (It seems like just a flavour thing, not game-mechanically significant.)*<br/><br/><br/>*: Ah, yes. It causes problems if you use the same characters for multiple adventures. Of course, the solution is to treat Traits just like Items, and reset their values for each adventure. Erase all your Trait and Item scores, and redistribute new points. You distribute a total of 8 points + your level. Level up after each successful adventure. If necessary, the limit for Trait or Item ratings should be limited to your level+2.**<br/><br/>**: Thinking further, it looks like Items can be lost in the game, so they ARE significantly different from Traits. Oh, well, I'll leave these notes here. I still think it would be fun to assign other characters Traits - perhaps at the end of each adventure, each character gets a new Trait, bestowed upon them by the other players, and then you can do the redistributing of points as above.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450263/#Comment_450263" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-01T21:44:13+00:00" title="January  1, 2016  9:44PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2016 6:14AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've written up a simple summary of all the game mechanics, for my own purposes.

Otherwise, it should be identical to the rules as written (if I did it right.)\n<blockquote><br/><b>Characters</b><br/><br/>Three Traits, rated 1 to 3 (higher is better)<br/>Two Items, rated 1 and 2<br/>A Spotlight Banana (Secret Weapon)<br/><br/><b>The Dungeon</b><br/><br/>Make a list of encounters/challenges.<br/>10 entries for a short game (equivalent to 4 challenges on average)<br/>20 entries for a long game (equivalent to 7 challenges on average)<br/><br/><b>The First Challenge</b><br/><br/>Make two piles.<br/>Challenge pile: 4 x players stones <br/>-- Whenever all the stones are removed, you win the current challenge!<br/>Trouble pile: One more stone than the Challenge pile, in a different colour (4xplayers+1)<br/>-- If the last stone is ever removed, you lose the current challenge!<br/>(Even if you also emptied the Challenge pile on the same turn.)<br/><br/><b>Each Round</b><br/><br/>Each player takes a turn.<br/>At the end of the round, each player takes one Trouble stone from the pile.<br/>(If the last one is removed, the Challenge is lost.)<br/><br/><b>Each Turn</b><br/><br/>Take one die by default (red)<br/>Add yellow dice for up to one Trait and/or one Item<br/>(Used Traits and Items are marked, cannot be used again)<br/>Add as many Trouble dice as you want (blue)<br/><br/><b>Rolling</b><br/><br/>Each 4-6 is a success (take one stone from the Challenge pile)<br/>Each 1-3 is Trouble (take one stone from the Trouble pile)<br/>Yellow dice cannot generate Trouble.<br/><br/><b>Trouble</b><br/><br/>If there is Trouble, read the relevant result from the Trouble table. The red die determines which column you use; the amount of Trouble determines the result.<br/><br/><b>Spotlight Banana</b><br/><br/>You can use your Banana once in the game. If you do, mark it. During this turn, your dice are successes if they are 3-6, and Trouble if they are 1-2.<br/><br/><b>Winning</b><br/><br/>If you have won the Challenge without emptying the Trouble pile, you may move on to the next Challenge. Before you do so, each player can spend any of her earned stones to:<br/>* Unmark another player's Items or Traits (cost equal to value)<br/>* Give a player a new Item (cost equal to twice the new value)<br/><br/><b>Losing</b><br/><br/>If you lost the Challenge (emptied the Trouble pile), return all the Trouble stones to the Trouble pile. You can still spend the Challenge stones, as described above.<br/>If you lose three Challenges, or lose the final Challenge, you've lost for good.<br/><br/><b>Sidenote: Unspent Stones</b><br/><br/>If, after a Challenge, you didn't spend all your stones, write down the number you have left so you can return the actual stones to the piles. (Otherwise, you'll mess up the math for the next challenge!)<br/><br/><b>Moving to a New Challenge</b><br/><br/>Roll 1d6 to find out which challenge you face next.<br/>Collect the Challenge and Trouble stones into two piles again; roll 1d6 and add its value (in stones) to the Challenge pile.

The amount of dice says nothing and shouldn't affect the description at all.<br/><br/>The rest of how to play the game is kinda up to you to explore. One flawed thing that sometimes happens is that the challenge seems finished, because all the obstacles are overcome, so sometimes the last participant must make up a new danger or a twist that the next person can respond to.<br/><br/>Oh, and go really hard on not describing anything before the roll. Declare the items and traits and roll dice. It's building a bridge between the mechanics and the fiction that makes the game, so the descriptions becomes hollow if you do them before rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450284/#Comment_450284" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-03T19:37:47+00:00" title="January  3, 2016  7:37PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 3, 2016 7:38PM by Rickard.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The challenge pile has 3 stones left. /.../<br/><br/>2.

The game only cares about what you should add to the description - not how you came to that conclusion. What happens before the roll doesn't matter for what the character is doing, only after the roll.<br/><br/>You can roll all sixes on ten blue dice and it will be less scary <i>for the character</i> than rolling three ones on three blue dice. Or, to put it in a better perspective, rolling all sixes makes something spectacular happen while three ones is foreshadowing a mishap (before reading the trouble table).<br/><br/>Rolling masses of blue dice doesn't (I would even say "shouldn't") affect the fiction, but it increases the probability to create something awful happening. Yes, it can create tension for you as a player - and the game usually does that sooner or later - but that particular feeling is nothing the character will ever notice unless the <i>result</i> of the dice creates it.<br/><br/>This is another reason why it's important to describe after the roll.<br/><br/>I can write lots about the theory behind these types of games and the dice rolling, but I will stop here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450297/#Comment_450297" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-04T09:50:46+00:00" title="January  4, 2016  9:50AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think you misread Guy's example.

I think that the statistics of the game is counter-intuitive. As an aside, I understand that a very significant part of the game is not here in these mechanics. I would just like to understand the statistical implications so that i can tinker with the rules.<br/><br/>First, here's a thing.<br/>Winning the first challenge just inside of 1 round allows 4 trouble per player, and 4 per player per round. It's 8 trouble dice, 1 red and 7 blue. It yields 4 sucesses. <br/>Winning in 2 allows 3 trouble, 1.5 per round. 6 dice, 2 red and thus 3 blue. You need 2 white to get the fourth sucess.<br/>Winning in 3 allows 2 trouble, 0.66 per round. 4 dice, 3 red, 1 blue. You need 4 white to get the fourth success.<br/>Winning in 4 rounds is unlikely as you roll 4 red dice and it's 2 trouble and thus you lost. <br/>This of course is to win 50% of the time, without considering the banana and trouble table results. The latter is very harsh if you get more than 2 troubles. You might want to throw in 1 or 2 white dice to have a much more reasonable chance. Winning much faster with a lot more white dice is counterproductive as you get less XP so it does not help you in the long term.<br/><br/>Harder challenges don't change the list above. The trouble part does not change, you just need to meet the higher success requirement. Adding more blue dice in harder challenges does not help, you need to add more whites to win those. So then, blue dice strategy does not depend on the challenge rating, one should do it the same all the time. The best way (statistically) would be to aim for a win just before the end of round 2 or round 3. That means 1 to 3 blue dice per challenge per player, and 3 or 4 white on the first challenge, increasing the whites by two by challenge.<br/><br/>If you are behind the probability curve within a single challenge, you are tempted to take more risks to get even. However, the most obvious thing, ie. adding blue dice does not help you at all. On the contrary, you are worse off with more blue dice: you get 0.5 success for 0.5 trouble per blue, AND you get worse results on the table. You can only improve your chances with white dice and the banana. These are simple resources that you can basically burn to get successes with relative reliability and no risk. I can only see two instances when adding blue dice helps you winning a challenge: right before the end of a round that causes you to lose anyways or with the banana. <br/><br/>If you look at the XP side, you can see the pressure. To be able win a 5-challenge game with a good safety margin (+2 white dice per challenge), you need 4+6+8+10+12 = 40 white dice. You start with 9. You might be able to refresh them once or maybe twice, let's say 15 more dice for 15 XP. But you need 16 more dice, that's 25-30 more XP. You earn 8+9+10+11=38 XP for the challenges AT MOST. So then the XP is barely enough to win a 5-challenge game. If you get one more challenge, you need 14 more dice but you get only 12 XP for the fifth challenge. It gets a lot harder when the game is longer. <br/><br/>All in all, blue dice are just the opposite of what one might think of them instinctively. You need to add more blue dice when you are winning: they are of long-term importance, and don't help much inside a challenge. You should use them to exploit your good luck. But you need the bananas to mitigate bad luck.<br/><br/>By the way, I don't really like this role of blue dice. I wished to see them as a short term tool to risk more in order to get even, but that's not the case in this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450370/#Comment_450370" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T07:59:38+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  7:59AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            way, that's an excellent analysis. The blue dice are for the long term, for getting XP. You'll generally want to space them out pretty evenly (since spikes put you in serious risk of dangerous results on the tables), but you can compensate depending on where you stand on the accumulated Trouble. If you still have a lot to go before hitting the limit, you might want to roll more blues in order to get as many XP as possible from the challenge. This is especially important in longer games. There really is a big difference in the difficulty in games of different length. A 10-game is going to be really easy and a 20-game is going to be really hard. To compensate for this, one could roll two dice for adding to the challenge pile, choosing the highest or lowest to adjust the difficulty. I haven't done the maths properly on this, but this adds or removes on average about 1 extra stone per challenge. I think this is should keep the difficulty on about the same level for , say, a 10-game compare to a 15-game, but again, I really haven't done the math on it.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you don't roll blue dice you'll drain your resources and fail, unless you roll really well or play a really short game. You need the blue dice for the long run, and, as way said, you should roll more of them when you're doing well, and fewer when you're doing badly. In the later, harder challenges, you'll need to be really conservative with your blue dice, but for that to be possible, you need to have amassed a good amount of powerful items to be able to bring those yellow dice to the table and skimp on the blue. Basically, use the blue dice to collect as much XP as you can in the early game, since you're going to need it in the late game. And, if you find the game is too easy, play a longer dungeon or increase the difficulty.<br/><br/>(I just realized, you can probably play a longer dungeon and roll both the speed you go through and the challenge level increases with "roll 2 keep highest". That way it should be about as difficult as a regular long dungeon (you have fewer chances to fail but also fewer chances to recover), but not take as long to play through.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450371/#Comment_450371" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T08:02:41+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  8:02AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Interesting!

Some people might like to figure it out for themselves, and some might want to know it in advance. Since it's a cooperative game, it might be a good policy to explain it to prevent people from making bad decisions that puts you at risk of a TPK (Total Party Kill). I don't think I usually mention it upfront (but then I never considered it very counter-intuitive, since I designed the game), but sometimes I might give suggestions in-game, like "We might as well roll a bunch of blues now, don't you think? We're far below the limit". But it depends on the group. Some people might engage more with the tactical aspect of the game and some might just want to do fun descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450414/#Comment_450414" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T18:52:44+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  6:52PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see!<br/><br/>Well, as a "playtester" who had to look over the rules to make my own summary (and a reader of this thread), I knew that you have to roll enough blue dice to earn XP, or you will founder later in the adventure.<br/><br/>My co-player (and way's players) clearly didn't have that experience.

This is later reinforced by the game when they are traveling to another dungeon (read: are leveling up). So it takes about one dungeon for the players to understand the importance of the blue dice but it takes them about half the game to actually grok their use.

Please do tell if i'm hijacking the thread. Also I'd be happy to hear about your experiences or rules alternatives you've tried or considered.<br/><br/>I got rid of the trouble pile, red/blue dice only yield the immediate drawback coming from the trouble tables. This has the "risk more to gain more" vibe instead of the careful balancing of blue dice. Every challenge takes two rounds, and is lost at the end of the second round. This simplifies maths, but takes away some of the thrill. Still worth it, I think. <br/><br/>I introduced Advantages, things you can create if you achieved at least 3 sucesses. This gives two white dice to the next roller if he exploits the Advantage and is lost if he doesn't. Advantages can snowball, if he also achieves 3 successes, the next one gains 3 dice, etc. End of round nullifies the Advantage. This was a great change, players thinking about exploitable advantages and focusing their attention more to the things happening in the fiction.<br/><br/>I introduced Overwhelming Success, 5 or more successes. This restarts a round with a fitting narration from the player. This was so-so. I wanted them to aim at these with blue dice, but it was more of an unexpected and unplanned for bonus if we got there. Also 5 was quite low at the later challenges and was not that hard to achieve, making late challenges actually easier. Or at least feel easier. Not good. <br/><br/>There is no recharge of traits, everything must be bought at a price of one stone per bonus. Also not only items, but more generic traits can be created as well. No boring recharge stuff, but loss of some continuity of characters. I still like the effect overall. <br/><br/>After a failed challenge you don't proceed with the chapters but someone creates a recovery challenge that is rooted in the specifics of the failure. Losing that means losing the adventure. Feels more like a story with consequences. <br/><br/>I still struggle with some issues. We found giving feedback on not-so-good narration awkward. But I have no idea if facilitating should go into the game rules or not. I also don't know what kind of rule this would be. Any ideas? We find the prewritten list of chapters not so inspiring, I am toying with the idea of just figuring it out as we go and use a dice roll to decide if it's the last-but-one chapter.

Instead of winning those stones you earn after a successful roll, you could spend them straight away to say stuff like "Now there's a ledge to step on!" or "Now the crocoldiles are distracted!".

The primary reason was that there's still a lot to include into the narration: the situation, the trait, the trouble, the advantage you exploit and the new advantage you create, and sometimes players were struggling even with these. I don't think we need a second trait to incorporate. But it also has the additional effect that the overall number of dice you roll is lower, and you are actually forced to use Advantages to win later challenges. So no, it did not seem to make things too easy. <br/><br/>As I wrote, Owerwhelming Success did make the game too easy.

With the current rules you can also create an Advantage (3 successes) and still get Trouble. The reason I find Advantage for Trouble charming is that it encourages blue dice which seems desirable. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine someone shooting for the 3 trouble option. It's more of an unexpected boon and that might or might not be interesting. People are happier if there is some gain in their suffering though. A silver lining if you wish.\n<blockquote><br/>EDIT: Would "rolled a certain number of successes on blue die" work as a threshold for earning Advantage?</blockquote>\nOh yeah, that can work. The only thing that might be a problem is that there is a slightly different use of Advantages: creating a longer plan and executing it. And blue dice is a gamble and goes against this planning stuff. Hmm. Maybe"roll 2 blue dice and get 3 successes total". Feels like coercion though. Also complicated.
