I'm really loving what I find in the book, and it reminds me of what I fell in love with when I discovered Ars Magica, in addition with a touch of what I fall in love with each time I play indie RPGs.<br/><br/>But,<br/>When I suggested it to my group, someone said with reluctance "I heard it on the net as an unfinished book". I come here to ask you if you know what he is talking about. The only thing I can imagine lacking in the book is more about scenario/situation creation, but John Wick says "let the players do the job" enough, though. My pal seems to talk about something serious, a real flaw the game had been tagged with.<br/><br/>Have you heard about HotB as an unfinished game ? If yes, what are the details ? What is it lacking ?<br/><br/>Bonus : Part two, if you have read the game, and especially if you have played the game, what didn't you like about it ?

It seemed like it was enough to run with for me...<br/><br/>As for caveats, when I was reading it I kept thinking that you'd have to be careful to strike the right mix of courtly intrigue/hob-nobbing/drama that could be handled with social manipulation and action based elements that the players have to handle personally and can't entrust to their underlings.  Parallel to that, I think there's probably a Goldilocks point of having just enough PvP tension/drama and PC/NPC plots to create drama between characters but not between players.

The Domain rules especially need fine attention, since...well, to run a campaign you must use those rules to provide structure. I'm guessing Wick was going for a Pendragon-ish vibe, but I feel the Domain rules need tightened up a bit. <br/><br/>The games yearns for a tighter structure, and some sort of relationship map or sorcerer-style back sheet. A list of important NPCs (player-defined of course) and such, unless you are playing a pure character on character conflict, then just mediate the conflicts and make interesting connections. <br/><br/>I ran a short game of Blood &amp; Honor, and to make it  cool. I had basically had to keep a careful eye on the domain rules, figure out implicit characters/conflict, and also remember that as narrator, I can just say things that are true. So the beginning of each session, I would do a preamble of events and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354451/#Comment_354451" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T07:34:34+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  7:34AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2012 7:42AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Houses of the Blooded is probably the most quintessentially John Wick game he's ever written.  Everything everyone has ever loved about his past books or his writing style in general is in it, but everything everyone could consider a flaw is in there too. In my opinion John Wick is a good idea man but very weak on execution; his games constantly make promises that they are ill-equipped to deliver.<br/><br/>My group played HotB for about a year, and we unanimously agreed the game is basically a first draft.  It needed much more editing to fix its very poor organization and bring in all the information for any given topic into the same section instead of scattering them around the book, both rules AND fluff. This might have also made him fix how much of it directly contradicts itself but maybe not, because sometimes HotB contradicts itself within the same page. <br/><br/>I think it also needed a lot more playtesting, because we were encountering rules giving weird results or flat-out not working as described from our first session; off the top of my head, the aging rules that "bring [PCs] closer to the inevitable doom of Solace. Unlike other games\u2014where the characters are perpetually stuck at the vague age of 'about 25,' never growing older, the passage of time never ravaging their youth" completely fail to make creeping age a meaningful factor because the ven lifespan is 240 "years", PCs start around 20 and age 1d6 "years" every four in-game seasons... each of which spans 1-3 game sessions.<br/><br/>HotB is attractive and eye-catching because it just has so much <i>stuff</i> in it, but when my group tried to actively interface with that stuff on its own merits we found the the rules clumsy and the book frustrating to reference.  I would call it "unfinished" without any hesitation, because the game just doesn't seem to work properly out of the box.  The basic "invoke aspects, wager dice, and establish facts" engine is brilliant (if a little challenging to GM), but almost everything else in there is more trouble than it's worth and by game's end we'd stopped using any of it.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite><br/>I really think people call it unfinished (&amp; I've heard people call it that too) not because it's got some huge glaring hole in the rules, but because it just doesn't really succeed, as a game, in what it's trying to do.

My group ended up having a lot of fun, but that was in large part due to intentionally disregarding or working against what was actually in the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354469/#Comment_354469" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T10:02:48+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 10:02AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey, so, y'all think we can rehabilitate HotB or it it too much of an aborted child?

And the game has a specific agenda.  And so long as you appear to gel with the agenda, you get Style points and everyone has a good time.  And when someone steps out of line, they lose Style points and we are all reminded how <i>not to act.</i><br/><br/>The game's main weakness is that the only thing that matters is the tone.<br/><br/>There's really a lot of fiction, and a lot of "conversational style" rules in the book.  And once you read and absorb it all you get the tone that it's trying to enforce.  But only as a whole.  The individual facts are mutable against the tone.  And tone is difficult to convey.<br/><br/>The result:<br/><br/>Everyone needs to be distant enough that they don't offend the "tone" set up and enforced by the GM (and the rules at large.)  But everyone needs to be proactive enough to drive things forward.  This involves players deliberately sabotaging their characters by <i>simply acting at all.</i>  It's poetically tragically wonderful, in a way, but intensely frustrating if you relate too heavily to your characters.  Throw them in the grinder and let them get destroyed, or don't play this game.<br/><br/>It's how the Ven live their lives.  Cheat, conquer, and don't get caught.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354584/#Comment_354584" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T04:11:59+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  4:11AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Libertarian sensibilities?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354637/#Comment_354637" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T07:55:42+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  7:55AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Libertarian sensibilities?</blockquote>\nI've heard a lot of critiques about HotB, but never "Libertarian sensibilities." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354639/#Comment_354639" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T07:56:45+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  7:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><br/>And yes, there's PVP.

The basic procedure of risk-wager-establish is good, but all the extended stuff like domain maintenance, aging, contacts, vassal training, dueling, learning new maneuvers, maintaining shrines to the Suaven... it just doesn't work very well.  We were constantly coming across awkward gaps in the rules and spackling them up with house rules until we just threw our collective hands up and stopped engaging with them completely.<br/><br/>I will say that the essential division between Duels and Mass Murder (a fair fight might go either way, but if he brings friends you either run and hide or bring even more friends) is a good idea, that constantly affected the way our group approached potential fights and made for many memorable moments of cowardice, but the stuff we were actually interested in, the stuff we were playing Houses to get at?

Totally adaptable, and a great narrative management system. It's presented like a traditional game, and there are lots of lists of abilities, which fights against the free flowing way it wants to be played. Namely, the pace can be so much faster and broader that it can be difficult to plan for stories - but the book does a good job of explaining this implicitly (at least) by demonstrating that the best way to present a HotB story is to start with a reason for characters to come together with enough room to get themselves into trouble.<br/><br/>The "lists of abilities" are the main stumbling block for me, including aspects, but especially combat and magic. Although Aspects are easy to play more loosely like in FATE, and just thinking about invoke/tag/compel as guidelines to think about to help ensure you've got a good one.<br/><br/>But I'm thinking you read the game differently, since you mention "libertarian sensibilities' and "reincorporation problem" - things I didn't see in the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354869/#Comment_354869" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T13:22:54+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  1:22PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2012 1:29PM by thadrine.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Read the game and played it a fair bit.<br/>I enjoy it and its tone greatly, if you have the right players. <br/>I also have never experienced the PvP aspect of the game, the half dozen times I have played.
