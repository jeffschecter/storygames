DO YOU!? I do...<br/><br/>anyway, shorter version...<br/><br/>I'm retaking a game I left quite a while ago, I've now read quite a lot of games, while, back then, I was only starting to immerse myself in the world of story games.<br/><br/>The game is a Psychic government agents modern campaign, I'm using the StoryTelling system with some minor hacks to make it resemble the loss of sanity derived from interacting with psychic stuff.<br/><br/>When we were still playing, and after reading DitV (my first indie game) I was eager to experiment and made some awful failures, but had some really decent achievements too.<br/><br/>It was the last game session we had that was the most memorable and interesting. I didn't quite get what it was I did back then but, after reading John Wick's Play Dirty last month I now realize more clearly what it was:<br/><br/>- I Had them play opposite sides: <br/><br/>This One I achieved by borrowing the plot from one of my favorite video games (Fahrenheit). I had my female character (I have two players, one female, one male, they are a couple IRL and In Game) be possessed by a sorcerous cult, She then was made to murder an innocent person in a completely random place, then, managed to resist the possession as the cult tried to make her commit suicide right there. When she regained free will she fled the scene and tried to forget about the whole thing. This All happened without the other player (Player!) knowing.<br/><br/>The next day, they were both assigned to investigate the very crime my female character was a victim and perpetrator of. She was too afraid to confess to her boyfriend, as she thought he wouldn't understand and would turn her in. (He was really into the norms of the organization and had been climbing the beurocratic ladder for some time)<br/><br/>Half the session was spent by the male character trying to catch the female one, her girlfriend, the love of her life, without him even knowing he was after her. And it was spent by the female character trying to deceive her boyfriend, trying to conceal and manipulate evidence so that he would never know what happened there (and her feeling quite guilty all the time).<br/><br/><br/>- I Had the characters' point of view turn upside-down: <br/><br/>In time, as it was inevitable, The girl had to confess herself to her boyfriend (the evidence was too compelling) This was a really powerful scene, both players whispering, both with tearful eyes, both afraid of what the other was going to say. both Players.<br/><br/>In the end, the male character decided to give up his career (which was one of the important points for this character) and give up most everything he knows and has to protect his girlfriend from the consequences of her (even if unwilling) actions.<br/><br/>The second part of the session they spent in finding ways to derail the investigation and make it become unsolved and cold. In the process, the one organization they both swore allegiance to (and the male character revered) became the enemy. But I didn't just leave it there, Oh no, I also had the brother of the male character, the local leader of a neo-nazi-ish psychic organization (a bunch of murderers who despise those who lack "the talent") come to be pretty handy in making it all appear unsolvable, and even had him help bring the cult that brought this awful situation to death.<br/><br/>I had the view they had on this world completely turn, it was fun, it was dramatic, it was memorable.<br/><br/>I left the game there, with both players wanting  more...<br/><br/><br/>So yeah! those were the two little tricks I used then, I, now, have a little more tricks I intend on using, but I'd also love for you guys to share yours!</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244729/#Comment_244729" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T19:52:29+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  7:52PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #0000CC;">Come on, guys!
