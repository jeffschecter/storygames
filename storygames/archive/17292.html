There is a certain campaign I've always wanted to run which is starting to border on white whale territory.<br/><br/>I want to run a game in the vein of Scott Pilgrim, Homestuck, and maybe a bit of Earthbound/Mother (which I have sadly never had the luck of playing - some day, though). A game of blinding 8-bit colors, improbable physics, superpowered badassery, and histrionic interpersonal drama. A game where it's not about saving the world - it's about every single fucking thing it's safety will cost you, and who you end up when the pixels have settled.<br/><br/>I'm willing to do some hack work, but I'd rather have something that works out of the box. I'd prefer something with a strong GM role.

So when you're walking through town, solving puzzles in Insipisphere, or playing a concert, you just describe stuff and it happens. But when there's a SHOWDOWN it goes into a combat game with emphasis on fighting techniques and special moves and the outcome of the fight drives the story forward from that point. The structure reminds me a lot of Scott Pilgrim specifically, since most of the books are Scott going about his life doing things punctuated by EPIC BATTLES that determine the next chunk of his life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392035/#Comment_392035" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-01T20:36:51+00:00" title="October  1, 2012  8:36PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh!

You'd need to replace pretty much all of the color, but the core mechanic and theme of "in battle your closeness to and trust in your friends and enemies is both your weapon and weakness" is perfect for the angst of emo ass-kickers.  On the other hand, it is semi-GMless by default, but in a way that ties into its "lucid dreaming" setting concept, so that's easy to change with a minimum of hacking (just ignore Anchors and the Authority Figure entirely). I believe Bliss Stage is currently available as a pay-what-you-want PDF, so check it out.<br/><br/>Anima Prime is also a decent call, and would require a bit less out-of-the-box tinkering.

I think a lot of games are like that, you just throw away the task resolution. Being a fan of both, I think the biggest difference between them is ultimately that Wushu is color-mandatory, the game doesn't work at all if players aren't pilling on cool descriptions regurlarly, and the system does nothing but ensure that, while Anima Prime is color-optional. It encourages you to do awesome stuff, but doesn't require it, and has more board game elements and tactics that you can engage with instead of the fiction. I think both could work for your purposes, especially the improbable physics and superpowered badassery, but AP is best if you want a bit of crunch and has some video game RPG nostalgia inbuilt in it, while Wushu is better if you want your players to narrate awesome stuf and won't take no for an answer. You should read both, at any rate.<br/><br/>Neither really intrisically support your more specific premise:<br/>"A game where it's not about saving the world - it's about every single fucking thing it's safety will cost you, and who you end up when the pixels have settled."<br/>I guess Bliss Stage does that? As well as Sorcerer and a handful of other more somber indie-games, I think. It could probably be hacked pretty easily into Wushu though, like maybe players can only roll traits rated at 5 by sacrificing their relationships or parts of their own personality or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
