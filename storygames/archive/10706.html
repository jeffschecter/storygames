I think I would take the wife out to dinner, at the local Big Boy where they have a really nice soup and salad bar that she likes. Be there a while while I picked a quick play theme and simple dice and experience mechanic for the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing self generated and public domain art, whip together the actualy writing and layouts for the thing. Save it to PDF and then solicit out a half dozen folks to playtest it in return for getting 3 free copies of it for their own use when I printed it. Use the feedback from those sources to tweak any faults in the mechanics and otherwise spot check spelling and such. Finished product would likely be a pocket sizes RPG. Mini book, perfect bound, color cover, about 100 pages B&amp;W interior (which being a mini book is about 10 pages of actual content)<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming I am allowed to use any of my printing toys, then I'd print up the 18 copies for the playtesters and ship them. Print 18 more up for the shelf for initial mail order. Put up the web page for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nReformat the game for 8.5" x 11" pages. Release it onto PDF.<br/>\n<br/>\nBudget.<br/>\nDinner plus tip ~ $35<br/>\nPrinting 36 copies ~ $7.60<br/>\nShipping 18 copies ~ $4.50<br/>\n<br/>\nNo too sure what I would do with the last $2.90<br/>\n<br/>\nMight make a short 60 page mini book. 18 copies. An adventurers equipment guide for the game or something. Also using public domain art or just graphic designing a cover. Cost $2.55. Maybe I could buy a slim jim or something with the last $.35?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn't sound too fancy? Lol. Well, its only $50.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and yeah, back in the day we started GOB Publishing on under $100. Its just easier now that PDFs are a cheap way to start generating some sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

The art would be used for merchandise, and the Chibi Edition (ashcan) of the book which would  then be used to continue expanding development of a fuller edition, and marketing efforts at anime cons and such. <br/>\n  Marketing would probably first fall back on running forum games for people on anime forums, then start to hopefully establish a snowball effect of actual plays and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237605/#Comment_237605" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T19:29:54+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  7:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would use the $50 as the prize for a contest.

Shreyas had been around the forge scene for years I guess when we released Mist-Robed Gate, but I did It's Complicated on a SMALLER budget than MRG, completely unknown, and got it going with preorders. I mean, fuck, people at <i>my own GenCon booth</i> the year it was released were like "Elizabeth.. You're Ben Lehman's girlfriend, right?" Nobody knew who the crap I was. I traded photography for Annalise for the layout of It's Complicated, harangued my boyfriend (not Ben Lehman, incidentally) into doing the interiors, and got my webmaster to do the cover of the book because he wants to get his name out as an illustrator for small press RPGs (his stuff is awesome, and <a href="http://www.miketilly.com" rel="nofollow">here.</a>) I took a risk on a brand-new (to external clients anyway) POD publisher in order to print more cheaply. Which I funded with pre-orders.\n<blockquote>You can make *a* game easily on no budget at all.

It's getting things printed and distributed that's killing me, I know that much, otherwise I'd have another game out by now.<br/><br/>Damn full colour artwork <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> it's just too pretty for black and white.<br/><br/>-Ash</blockquote>\nIt depends on what you consider to be good production values. Again I'd point at MRG; the production values for IC are not quite as good, but there was a huge response to the small form factor-- which was the <i>direct result</i> of me trying to make the game as cheaply as possible. Let me repeat: I tried to do something cheaply and it came off as novel. It's all about thinking outside the box. I'd say Time and Temp: unbound edition has fucking awesome production values and it's in a manila envelope, whereas Ribbon Drive is luscious full-color and really difficult to read.<br/><br/>I'm interested in knowing what you mean by "a high street distribution scheme," though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237685/#Comment_237685" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T10:03:05+00:00" title="October 15, 2009 10:03AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2009 10:09AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, so here's some further thoughts.<br/><br/>1) $5.50 US per game, max 10 games, minimum 5 games. 50 copies each. Once they're gone, they're gone. (the 50c is paypal fee offset).<br/>1a) Games must take up at most two sides of an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper (A4ish for internationals) and be in black and white.<br/>1b) I can do minimal binding work. This means I can cut the sheet in half and staple it for an 8 page booklet, or cut the sheet in quarters and staple them for a 16 page booklet. If you need help laying out the 16 page booklet properly, I can help with that. If your game is large, it may be folded to fit it in the envelope.<br/>1c) Games should be attractive and legible. No 7 point fonts please. I reserve editorial authority to reject any game, or accept-pending-revisions.<br/>1d) This is not for playtesting. The goal is to provide short, high quality games to people for the cost of an envelope and a stamp.<br/><br/>2) Time limited. Basically when I leave the US, I have to turn the shebang over to someone else or just can it.<br/><br/>3) To participate, mail me a letter-sized SASE and indicate on it which games you would like. If you're taking more than one game, consider including extra stamps or an extra envelope (both of which will help with international customers).<br/>3a) Ask for as many games as you like. But do keep in mind that this is for players, not collectors. If you take a lot of copies there will be less for everyone else. Thus, please don't ask for a game you don't have an inkling to play, or that you already have a copy of you made yourself.<br/>3b) If I don't have any left of the game you want, I will send you another game that I think you might like.<br/>3c) International customers can use an international SASE, which I don't know how works but I'm pretty sure there's a way, or they can just paypal me $2 to cover costs.<br/>3d) Maybe Joe will run it for Canada, or Graham for the UK, or what have you. In which case I'll send them 5-10 copies of each game and they'll dispose of them. Or they'll handle their own thing, like this, but different in however they want it to be different.<br/><br/>4) I may include small promotional material for TAO Games in the mail-out. A product list, probably. I may also piggyback some requested Clover playtest copies. This violates 1d, but it's the perk for running the show.<br/><br/>5) If you participate, it would be great of you to write about your experience with the program, with playing the game you got, etc. It's even better if you do it somewhere that isn't Story Games, like RPGnet or RPGsite or whatever.<br/><br/>I think that the sponsors for games shouldn't be the authors. I don't want to take money from authors for this, but rather from people who are enthused about the whole idea, or want to evangelize a particular game that they love to play.<br/><br/>Still on the fence about time.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237684/#Comment_237684" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T10:04:01+00:00" title="October 15, 2009 10:04AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, I think you've been very lucky, not least because of all the people you persuaded to help out for free or talent swap (something I've tried in the past and never managed to make work)  So I reckon you're in a small minority there.

Not having seen MRG myself I can't comment on the other details in your post.<br/><br/>By 'Good Production Values' I mean... well... what would be a good example? 3:16 would be better than 'Good'... let's say 'Cartoon Action Hour: Season 2' as a reasonable standard to measure by. Good layout, decent art, and enough of it to break up the text. I'm also talking about original art here, not public domain works or clip-art. Yes, you can get good examples of both, but my point was more that it's not always possible to find enough public domain works that are all in a similar, suitable style. If you *can* use clip art and PD works then your job gets a lot easier.<br/><br/>By 'High Street Distribution' I mean the traditional three-tier format of RPG distribution. You do a print run and send it to the fulfiment house. About a month after that, the distributor's got it. About a month after THAT you get some money for it, and it could be anytime in the next month that it actually hits the shelves.<br/><br/>If you've got any hints as to how to solicit pre-orders, I'd love to hear them. I've generally been against them in the past 'cause I don't like the idea of selling something that I don't yet have, but if there's some way of doing pre-orders that provides a good amount of legal protection for both the purchaser and the publisher, I'd like to know about it.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237691/#Comment_237691" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T10:13:36+00:00" title="October 15, 2009 10:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, we should split this into another thread, but it's rather exciting, and I'd happily mail out stuff from the UK.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237695/#Comment_237695" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T10:21:52+00:00" title="October 15, 2009 10:21AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Ben, we should split this into another thread, but it's rather exciting, and I'd happily mail out stuff from the UK.</blockquote>\nSeconded.

In the UK it always used to be strictly two-tier distribtion, no fulfilment house, for example.

I will say that part of what garnered the interest and help is that I playtested the fuck out of my game, sometimes up to five times a week, on IRC and considered all feedback, tried almost every single suggestion given to me in my playtesting posts on the Forge, and blogged about the experience regularly. That part wasn't easy, but it was necessary and fun.<br/><br/>I broke many of the traditional rules about pre-orders last time, so I won't be offended if it doesn't fit other people's definition of "successful" because I took a high-risk approach. My personal definition of a successful pre-order is "It paid for my print run." No more, no less.<br/><br/>The printer did not have my files when I announced pre-order. I did not have my files when I announced pre-order; my layout person was still working on it, in fact. I started my pre-orders because a friend who shall not be named called me and said "What the fuck Elizabeth, you are going to be in huge trouble if you don't start your pre-order RIGHT NOW."<br/><br/>Here is what I think made it successful:<br/><br/>- Choosing the right price for my game. I didn't want it to be prohibitive, but I was warned against making it too cheap for perception reasons. I think it worked out to something like, for every pre-order I got, I could print four copies of my book.<br/><br/>- Posting here and on my blog about the pre-order, detailing what would be in the book itself.<br/><br/>- Contacting every person involved in playtesting it with me to let them know it was in pre-order. Not a form email. I contacted everyone individually. The individual relationship is very important to me; that's why every physical copy of my games mailed out from me comes with a hand-written note, long after it became a pain in the ass to do it.<br/><br/>- Being too new to fail. I was surprised and overwhelmed by the interest in my game, and every pre-order was a monetary admonition not to fuck it up. That meant separating my pre-order cash from the rest of the money in my paypal account, keeping in close contact with my printer, following up on questions and concerns, refunding any accidental payments within an hour of a problem (I think I had my paypal button set up incorrectly initially, and stayed up to fix it and refund the two people who'd overpaid at, like, 3 AM), and handling any issues myself. When my layout person got too swamped to finish the project and put in the final tweaks, I got the layout files from him and planted myself in Panera for six hours to do it myself in order to meet my print deadline. I didn't have a reputation that I could skate on if I let any of this fall through the cracks. This was my shot. <br/><br/><br/>When I say "this was easy," I don't mean the experience. Making something worth making is never easy. I'm saying spending $50 and only $50 of your own money on a game is easy. Staying within a budget-- whatever that budget is-- should be easy if you map your expenses clearly, think flexibly, shop around, and know what is ACTUALLY important to your game. There's stuff that's nice, and then there's stuff that's necessary, and you need to be able to prioritize the stuff that's nice and still ONLY go after that if you have money left after what's necessary. It's Complicated has color pages because it's the only way to really demonstrate the game board-- people kept telling me to find a different way to represent that information to keep my print costs low, but finding a different way to represent the information wouldn't show you how the info is represented <b>when you're actually playing the game.</b> And part of how you stay within a budget is sweat equity, that's no lie. I've been running my own business since I was 19 and messed up my finances more times than I can count by allocating my resources incorrectly. It's been years since I screwed up like that, though, because eventually you learn or else you're homeless.<br/><br/>I can't speak to distro, as It's Complicated is in sore need of a reprint, but IPR and the Unstore both seem to be doing well for MRG. A huge amount of the MRG stock moved by IPR is retail. The cost there is in profit, not out-of-pocket funds. I mean, we're not operating at a loss there, but in comparison to the profit margin on direct sales? I feel like, until new ways of marketing are pioneered, three-tier distro may be the new vanity press. I don't think worse of people who don't want to lose 50% (or more) of cover just to see their book on a shelf in a store.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237785/#Comment_237785" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T18:29:40+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  6:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2009 6:30PM by Johnstone.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Wow Johnstone, remind me not to buy anything you make. There's a wealth of free and legal layout tools, royalty-free artwork, and people willing to work for trade. I just.. I'm baffled.</blockquote>\nOkay, sure. You're assuming I would steal layout programs, steal art, and steal instead of trading. I didn't say what I'd steal, so I'll hit those:<br/><br/>I write everything in a copy of Word a friend gave me about 12 years ago. Thinking about it, he probably didn't pay for it either, so I might be guilty on this count. When I want a real layout program, I'll look at the free stuff, both kinds, and make a choice. I can't afford to pay rent right now, so hell if I'm gonna buy a layout program. If I come into a lot of money, I won't mind spending it.<br/><br/>If the game is for sale, art theft is almost universally not worth it, regardless of the ethics. If I can't find royalty-free art or historical public-domain art that fits my game, I'm kinda hooped, though. So if I can find public domain art, I won't buy any, and if I can't find free art, then I'd consider buying some. My current plan is to win Jake's Awesome Fantasy Game Contest, but I don't know how well that's going right now.<br/><br/>Still, there's that $50 limit. Now in real life, there's a time an effort limit too, even if I have more money. So yeah, I can trade for stuff, assuming I have skills in demand (nobody's knocking down my door for favours), and time. I didn't say I wouldn't do any of that, but if I don't have time, money, or exploitable friends... then, yeah, I'm going to think about cutting corners where there aren't any consequences vs. compromising my artistic integrity (or whatever).<br/><br/>It's cool that you think that stealing is wrong and everything, but the ethics of indie game design kinda pale compared to the ethics of electronics manufacturing, which actually kills people. And we're all using computers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237810/#Comment_237810" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T01:53:32+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  1:53AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, check computer magazine cover disks and websites, you can often pick up older versions of Quark that are fully usable on them for next to nothing.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237815/#Comment_237815" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T03:15:53+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  3:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I'll check that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
