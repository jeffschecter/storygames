Diffuse the sex scene."<br/>And you have to figure out how that works.<br/>And it's part puzzle game, part lucid dream game, part abstract creativity.<br/><br/>And you have the option to do your job "straight" or play around in the dream.<br/>You can deal with it as a technician, as an explorer, or as a warrior.<br/>You can remove the misplaced element, or bridge over it.<br/>You can then leave, or you can "tag" the dream with your own little marks.

So each dream has only certain dreams that it can naturally transition to, as long as certain conditions (narrative, mechanical) are met: Running Away can turn into Falling if you tear away the context and foundation of the scene, and make a roll against your Solipsism (or what-have-you), or it can become Facing the Monster if you make a roll against Courage and describe an obstacle that arrests your flight.<br/><br/>The goal would be to move to some particular precious point on the web.<br/><br/>If it were me, I'd lean away from the "technician" angle and go for more of a "shaman" thing, picking a real-world culture's perspective on dreams.  The Egyptians had detailed dream-interpretation systems, for instance.<br/><br/>I certainly think that it's interesting.  I'm reminded of <em>Lacuna</em> and <em>Bliss Stage</em>, both of which are close to my heart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215783/#Comment_215783" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T12:11:12+00:00" title="July  1, 2009 12:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NickNovitski</cite>The goal would be to move to some particular precious point on the web.</blockquote>\nThis put a really interesting mechanical idea in my head.  What if each type of dream represented a pattern of stones on a weblike board?  You start with a platonic outline of a "normal" dream, then the person doing the skewing moves a few stones out of place to represent where the dream is going wrong, attaching a detail to each.<br/><br/>Players can get in there and attempt to move things back into alignment, but of course, if they fail, the stones only move farther out of place.  If things go really badly, you might have to just roll with it and end up converting the dream into a whole different pattern--or creating a new one!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215812/#Comment_215812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T13:50:45+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  1:50PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><br/>What if we pretended we were dream technicians?<br/>And our job was to go into broken dreams and tweak them back to their correct course?</blockquote>\nSo, uh, the Psychonauts RPG?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215824/#Comment_215824" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T14:18:54+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  2:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nick,<br/><br/>I'm definitely feelin' everything you're laying down.
