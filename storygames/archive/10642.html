It's the tragic tale of a boy and his dinosaur.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/115/dinosaur-hruck/" rel="nofollow">Ballad of Dinosaur Hruck</a></b>\n<blockquote>The one-line summary we came up with for the history is that a massive colony ship crashes on a planet inhabited by dinosaurs, where the survivors build a new civilization from scratch after collapsing into stone age primitivism.<br/><br/>As we play we see that dinosaurs become the main source of labor for the colonists \u2014 they\u2019re beasts of burden, powerful tools, and when necessary, war-machines. They\u2019re the "technology" that helps the new civilization grow (and no, you\u2019re not the first person to say "You mean like the Flintstones?" No, not like the Flintstones. Like Dinosaur Planet, or Dinotopia, or some other book I haven\u2019t read.). We\u2019ve also established that the dinosaurs are basically normal animals \u2014 they have beast-level intelligence and they can\u2019t talk or anything cartoony like that. Again, not the Flintstones.<br/> <br/>So it\u2019s late in the game session and I\u2019m the Lens again. We\u2019ve already played four other Foci, so we\u2019ve fleshed out a lot of the history. In a "well, let\u2019s see how this works" moment, I make the Focus a dinosaur. One specific dinosaur. I decide it\u2019s a triceratops-like beast, and his name is Hruck. And that\u2019s all we know.<br/> <br/>Why should we care about this dinosaur? What\u2019s interesting about him? I have no idea, but I figure we\u2019ll find out together.</blockquote>\nI have never had so much fun in a game with dinosaurs that didn't talk.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
