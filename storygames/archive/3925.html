In <a href="http://blog.realitymerchants.com/articles/2007/07/26/undiscovered-countries-session-001-post-game-report/" rel="nofollow">my first post</a> on this campaign, I gave some details into the setup, the system, and the campaign premise, so I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll skip all that and get right to the meat.<br/><br/><b>The Cast</b><br/><br/>    * Alex, playing the part of <b>Captain Daylen Forgrun</b>.<br/>    * Gaston, playing the part of <b>Calvo Sotelovich</b>.<br/>    * Nathanael (me), Arbiter, playing the part of <b>Mihoaela Tatiana Kojimirin</b>.<br/>    * Nievita, playing the part of <b>Aeroica Mindal Tsvetkov</b>.<br/>    * Scott, playing the part of <b>Khazimir ibn Zalikahn</b>.<br/><br/><b>The Story Thus Far\xe2\u20ac\xa6</b><br/><br/>In our last episode, we met our questionable heroes as they embarked upon an off-the-records job to retrieve stolen papers of bureaucratic importance to their sometime employer, one Mister Kabalaros (an old childhood friend of the Captain\xe2\u20ac\u2122s). They were offered a decent sum of money for this task, and a hefty bonus should they wreak additional \xe2\u20ac\u0153burning vengeance\xe2\u20ac\x9d upon those that stole the papers.<br/><br/>After an encounter with some Navigators resulting in the larcenous acquisition of a strange skychart, the mission was on. Our heroes succeeded in retrieving the goods, in addition to finding some strange egg-shaped objects in the process - four of them, to be exact. The Captain managed to rescue a prisoner in the process, who turned out to be the daughter of Kabalaros. A failed attempt to free some slaves was made, and most of the escaping bad guys were put to flame, but a few did manage to escape and spread the word, adding a bit more infamy to the name of Captain Daylen Forgrun and the crew of Oblivion.<br/><br/>The requested goods were delivered, the eggs were hidden away, and fathers were reunited with daughters in a variety of ways. The crew sailed away into the Blue, paid and supplied and ready for more work, but with the knowledge that Kabalaros most definitely wanted those eggs, yet for some reason was hesitant to ask for them. However, the following questions were introduced, yet remained unanswered:<br/><br/>    * What are these eggs, and why does Kabalaros secretly desire them?<br/>    * Who were the folks who stole the papers?<br/>    * What is the importance of the stolen Navigators\xe2\u20ac\u2122 skychart?<br/><br/>(<a href="http://blog.realitymerchants.com/articles/2007/08/14/undiscovered-countries-session-002-embers-of-the-past/" rel="nofollow"><b><i>The Story Continues : Episode 2 - Embers of the Past</i></b></a>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
