It consists of about 1,000,000 lines of code and 3 Gbytes of artwork that you are now free to use in your own projects, provided you follow the terms of the open source licenses.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.ryzom.com/en/" rel="nofollow">Ryzom Home Page</a><br/><br/><a href="http://media.ryzom.com/" rel="nofollow">Ryzom Artwork</a><br/><br/><a href="http://dev.ryzom.com" rel="nofollow">Ryzom Developer Site</a><br/><br/><a href="http://atys.ryzomnomnom.com/wiki/Category:Official_Screenshots" rel="nofollow">Ryzom Screen Shots</a><br/><br/>Ryzom offers a 21 day free trial.  So, check it out!  You'll be impressed.<br/><br/>Here is an example screenshot:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://atys.ryzomnomnom.com/w/images/f/f8/Screenshot_fyros_special_place03.jpg"/><br/><br/>The only artwork that Ryzom did not open source are the actual landscape of the major continent, the storyline and quests, and the specific skills and spells used by characters (the core game rules, though, are incorporated into the open sourced code).  Even if you aren't into online gaming, you may have some use of their extensive artwork collection.<br/><br/>Personally, I plan on hacking on the source code and modifying/replacing the game rules to suit my own tastes.  I am totally stoked!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279096/#Comment_279096" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T09:45:59+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  9:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yeah, Ryzom!  I had some comments around here somewhere...<br/><br/>[EDIT] Found them, in the May 2010 Stuff to Watch thread:<br/><br/>=============================================<br/>(auf mich):<br/><br/>Ahhh, Ryzom. Back when it came out, it was promising a new and awesome fantasy setting. High on Morrowind and wanting to try something new (Oh! Perhaps one of those spirit-people who wear masks all the time), and having bad experiences with the "You appear in your underwear with a dagger and need to kill rats to buy pants" theme of other MMOs at the time, I gave it a show, and spent about an hour crafting a cool spirit dude character...<br/><br/>...and then appeared in the world in nothing but a loincloth and a dagger, and spent an hour killing Fantasy Rats in order to get the money to buy pants.<br/><br/>I tried wandering away from the starting area to find the beautiful fantasy Morrowind-esque landscapes the game promoted, but got killed about 5 minutes later in a coordinated rat attack. <br/><br/>I wasn't able to buy pants before I lost interest...<br/>============================================                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279097/#Comment_279097" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T09:47:14+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  9:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which is to say:<br/><br/>If you can hack Ryzom so that you can explore, connect with others and engage in the characters and the world, all without having to slay monsters to buy basic trousers, that would be pretty cool.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279108/#Comment_279108" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T11:00:14+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 11:00AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.  Most MMORPGs bore me to tears, and Ryzom has a lot of the same characteristics.  Specifically, it has a lot of grinding to gain levels.  I don't really mind that as much as the not being able to explore much before grinding.  If I could explore a good part of the world independently of grinding to gain levels, then I wouldn't mind the grinding so much.<br/><br/>But, as you say, the exciting part here is the ability to re-create the game to suit a different style of play.  I think MMORPGs represent a huge potential in terms of what's possible, and that what's out there already in this domain has only scratched the surface.  I want to explore some of the possibilities, and this gives me the opportunity to do that.  I'm trying to finish up on my current projects so I can dive into this fully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
