As it stands at the moment:<br/>\n<br/>\n - the players are split into two even teams.<br/>\n<br/>\n - each player has a supply of dice (approx. 6, for the sake of argument).<br/>\n<br/>\n - each team is trying to achieve a goal; the two goals are mutually exclusive, such that progress towards your team's goal not only moves your team closer to completion, but moves the other team further away from final success. Think of a tug-of-war, with a counter on a short track representing the current progress of the teams.<br/>\n<br/>\n - once per 'phase', each team may attempt an action that progresses them towards their goal; each player on that team secretly chooses whether to particpate or not by placing one of their limited supply of dice in their hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n - all members of the team reveal their choice at the same time; the dice revealed are rolled at once. The team succeeds if any of those dice rolls a '6'. All the dice rolled are lost after the roll, regardless of the result.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo complete your team goal, players have to co-operate in order to get successes, but there is also incentive for players to not participate in team rolls in order to keep their own dice. This is the point at which I need input: in each phase, I want each player to interact with one player on the opposite team, using the dice they have in their supply. If achieving your team goal is the key top overall success, what is the incentive for not participating in your team roll? Should you earn dice for successful interactions with your opponents or cause them to lose dice? Score private victory points? Modify the team roll in some fashion?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202641/#Comment_202641" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T02:03:02+00:00" title="April 19, 2009  2:03AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>There's a team strategic decision in not all players rolling dice. If each player has 6 dice, and you have a full table of 12 people, each team has a range of attempts from 6 (all players roll in all phases) to 36 (only one player rolls in each phase). Unless there's something else I'm missing, the players are going to want to push their possibilities as far toward that 36 as possible without lowering their chance per attempt for success too much.</p>\n<p>I think that spread needs to be sussed out before you start looking at personal motivations.</p>\n<p>If you've already considered that, what are your current thoughts there? That'll influence the personal motivations, I think.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202670/#Comment_202670" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T11:35:59+00:00" title="April 19, 2009 11:35AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I highly recommend giving each player character a personal win condition in addition to their team win condition, and then design so those are often in conflict.
