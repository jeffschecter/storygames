I just don't understand it. The person who is buying the physical book wants the PDF for one, two, or all of three reasons as I see it:<br/><br/>1. In order to have a copy in their hands quicker than UPS/USPS delivers packages, in order to start reading right away.<br/>2. In order to have a copy of several of their favorite games on an e-reader, as opposed to lugging around that many hard copies.<br/>3. Similarly, in order to print out copies of key bits of the book, like condensed instructions, reminders, character sheets or other materials from the book for their players to use at the table.<br/><br/>So yes, there are benefits to a PDF that make the bundle more attractive than a hard copy alone, but it is blatantly obvious to the end user that it is not costing the publisher a dime to drop them an email with a PDF copy attached, so it feels a bit like being gouged.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409215/#Comment_409215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T20:50:42+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  8:50PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how much do you think a second copy of the softcover or hardcover should cost?

It definitely takes time, effort, and if you get professional assistance, money to make a PDF. But what if that's the same PDF that you sent to the printer who made the book that the consumer bought from you? Does it have additional value that people should be getting charged for? <br/><br/>Here's the thing: You print a book, the printing costs you money and the PDF you sent to the printer costs you money (if you had it professionally laid out, edited, etc) but that money goes twice as far for you, because you can make a PDF or print copy out of the same file. Once you have paid for the editing, et al, that money is gone, but you only ever pay for it once. Printing costs happen every time you need to print a new batch of books, whether you are using offset to save costs in bulk, or just going with a service like Lulu, CreateSpace, etc.<br/><br/>So the way I am seeing it, when I buy your book, I am paying you for creating it, I am paying your printer for making the physical artifact, *and* I am paying your editor, illustrator, and layout professionals. Are those costs not built in to a physical book? If they are, then why am I paying twice for the layout and illos to get a file that, once you have it, costs nothing to reproduce?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409241/#Comment_409241" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T05:20:44+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  5:20AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a>: Full price, because I would consider that the price of the book already has all that stuff factored in, whereas the PDF is ones and zeroes that can be copied infinitely once the person has bought your book.<br/><br/>My question to you: Would you charge a person twice for the PDF if they said they were going to keep one on a tablet and one on their home PC?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409243/#Comment_409243" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T05:35:20+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  5:35AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2013 5:38AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people would love to be able to charge you a micro-fee every time you looked at their work, if they could.

I've bought a printed book, didn't like the price on the PDF bundle and then just went and found the PDF file elsewhere.  And as an added bonus, it didn't have each paged marred with some crappy watermark.  I have also bought PDFs and still downloaded a pirate copy because they don't have the same crappy watermark on every page.  And all the security stuff is turned off so if I want to extra an image or a table to make a play aid, I can.<br/><br/>I won't pay twice either (and certainly not for an inferior product in the form of a marked up locked down PDF).

Consumer PDFs will (ideally) be lighter, full of links and bookmarks, and probably including the cover as extra pages (where the printer gets them as separate files). <br/><br/>As Ben said, a PDF included for free is promotional. In the case of publishers participating in Bits and Mortar, it's value and convenience for the customer and a way to support brick-and-mortar retailers by helping them compete with online retailers. It's an excellent idea and I encourage publishers to do it, but it's not cost-free. Setting up the mechanics that allow people to download files has a cost in time, as does the customer service involved in making sure people get their files. Preparing good PDFs costs time, or contractor fees.<br/><br/>The cost of a "free" PDF is often built into the cost of the print book (as you suggested) but that's not the only model. as Jason Pitre said, you could make the print book a little cheaper by charging for the PDF.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy" title="TheOtherTracy"><img alt="TheOtherTracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/711/nUY8JIY0C5ZHL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">TheOtherTracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409248/#Comment_409248" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T07:36:10+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  7:36AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't give it much thought beyond "I like this when I'm a consumer, so I'm going to do it as a publisher."

The printing costs will probably be about $4 a unit, the Editing, Art and Layout increase the costs by another $3 a unit, bringing the costs to about $7/each. Accounting for shipping, or fulfillment, I'm probably only taking home $12, minus those per unit costs, or about $5 per individual physical book sold.  Those numbers only hold up if I'm selling 1000 units of my print run.  In reality, I only start seeing profit (or income from my work) after selling something crazy like the 800th book through physical retail.<br/><br/>If I was selling my PDF's for $5 a piece? That's $3.50 each without those costs built in. Even if I sold to a fifth of my audience, that would be a major help to my bottom line. <br/><br/>So yeah, the economics make it damn tempting. As Fred Hicks said on one of his podcast seminars, by including the PDF we are actively choosing to leave that cream on the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409262/#Comment_409262" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T09:37:13+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  9:37AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve is right - if you're just selling the PDF that you're using to print to a consumer, you are not doing a good job of creating PDF RPG material.  The one you sell to a consumer should have hyperlinks, cards, bookmarks, everything good that can come about from an electronic world.<br/><br/>Let me show you something amazing: <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/28882" rel="nofollow">0one Games</a> material. I linked you to one of their free offerings.<br/><br/>There's tons of people creating maps/terrain on paper, and most of them are crap. 0one Games maps by contrast:<br/><br/>You can turn on or off grids of various sizes and types, borders of various blackness/greyness, furniture, doors, etc. You can customize these maps in dozens of combinations just by a single click.<br/><br/>Saying "welp, if 0one games did a print version of this, the PDF should be free/cheap" is crazy. If they did a print version you would be getting things like cool paper or ultra-high resolution or something.  It would have other advantages.<br/><br/>Electronic RPG material at its best should take advantage of the total freedom it offers to individual groups.<br/><br/>Now, plenty of people sell shit electronic RPG material, so this logic doesn't hold for them but this is what the aspiration is/should be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409264/#Comment_409264" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T09:53:45+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  9:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Market forces!<br/><br/>For a while, I offered the print and the PDF.

Why would that be strange? Usually you get like five machines with one price, though.<br/><br/>My point, however, is this: The assumption that books should cost a bunch of money goes completely unchallenged pretty much everywhere. You say it costs nothing to email a pdf, it's "ones and zeros." Okay. So a book is just paper and ink. If you order a print copy of the Metamorphica it costs me nothing to get it to you. Literally nothing, not even time. You have to pay someone else to print it and you have to pay postage, sure. So if a book costs $4 to make and the other $16 is you paying the author for their creation, why does it make sense to pay that $16 twice for two copies that are exactly the same?<br/><br/>Because that's how physical book sales operate, and piracy hasn't been able to challenge that assumption much. And yet, when you talk about pdfs, you seem to be assuming that there's a licensing type deal in effect: you pay for the product once and you get to use it on multiple platforms, and if you buy a hardcopy, you should get the book on the other platforms, too.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say you should think one way or the other, I'm just pointing out this assumption. Why does the books have "all those costs figured into it" but the pdf doesn't? Is it because you're assuming there's a print run and the creator is assuming X amount of profit? I've also noticed this community is pretty focused on printed books as the standard commercial product, while other rpg communities don't share this attitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409289/#Comment_409289" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T15:39:29+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  3:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone is, in fact, correct. PDFs are generally sold at a considerable discount wrt print, if you account the costs of art (design, testing, writing, editing, layout, illustration).<br/><br/>You aren't paying for "ones and zeroes." You're paying (or not paying), for art. Art has value regardless of the form it's delivered in.<br/><br/>If you'd like ones and zeroes in bulk, I will sell you as many as you like at a fraction of the cost. (same, too, with paper and ink).<br/><br/>(Since someone is going to say it, this has nothing to do with "art should be free." Food should be free, too, and you can get a damn good meal at a soup kitchen at no cost. That doesn't mean that I can walk up to a food cart and start arguing with them that they should feed me for free: different economies apply.)<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409291/#Comment_409291" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T16:23:00+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  4:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2013 4:24PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great discussion. For the record, as a consumer I have absolutely no qualms with paying for a PDF (I want the author to take my money as a reward for producing something of value, after all), although I do like (and will pay for) having both a hard copy and a PDF copy.<br/><br/>However, publishers who make some or all of their material available electronically stand out, as well. I think it's really cool, for example, that you can download all the AW playbooks from Vincent's site instead of having to order them as a separate booklet or photocopy them out of the main book or some other such thing. That wins my loyalty and respect, as a consumer, because it shows the publisher cares about my convenience as a customer and wants people to see their work. So that's cool, too.<br/><br/>I have a newbie question, though:\n<blockquote><br/>Let's use my book as an example, with some ballpark numbers. The printing costs will probably be about $4 a unit, the Editing, Art and Layout increase the costs by another $3 a unit, bringing the costs to about $7/each. </blockquote>\nI understand that printing a book costs a certain amount per unit (obviously), and that this can vary depending on the print run (many/most printers offer a discount for printing in bulk, as far as I know).<br/><br/>But why are "Editing, Art and Layout" costs included in the "per unit" calculation here? What is that referring to? Is it an estimate based on the costs of the production divided by units printed (and, therefore, would drop with a second print run)? I thought things like Editing, Art and Layout were basically "one-time" costs, paid up-front, not per unit. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409294/#Comment_409294" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T16:49:44+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  4:49PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But why are "Editing, Art and Layout" costs included in the "per unit" calculation here?

In that case, it makes sense to consider the one-time costs in the overall profitability of each book.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that crowd-sourcing throws these sorts of calculations off to some degree. Reward levels are often more than the simple costs of printing, art, and editing. Other factors such as transaction fees, shipping, rewards, and risk are all built in as well. More to the point, backers (patrons, really) will often contribute well over the value of their rewards to see the project reach it's goal. <br/><br/>(sorry, I think I'm helping to drag this discussion off topic)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409297/#Comment_409297" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-16T17:45:52+00:00" title="March 16, 2013  5:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, that's a good answer to my question.

Do you charge for the PDF? Do you give it for free when people buy the book? Do you give people the book at cost and then ask them to become patrons of future works if they like it? Do you ransom new projects? Do you create things for free and then hope that your reputation and work land you paying gigs in the future?<br/><br/>How you price a PDF doesn't reflect the "cost" of manufacturing it, necessarily, but rather is part of your strategy for getting paid for hard work you've done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JArcane" title="JArcane"><img alt="JArcane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/854/n4Y45NQIBSR28.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JArcane">JArcane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409358/#Comment_409358" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T14:10:48+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  2:10PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>JArcane, let me ask you the same question as I asked earlier: If I wanted two hardcopies from you, would I get a discount?</blockquote>\nNo, but whoever got the second copy (assuming it was bought for someone else) would be entitled to a PDF copy of their own, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>I see it as a fair use issue, really.

If something can be infinitely reproduced at next to no cost and the very act of accessing it creates a new copy, then any scarcity is going to have to be artificially forced onto it from the outside.  I think deep down people know this and thus don't like paying more for a PDF after buying a print copy.  If the argument is one of it being a separate product, people see through the artificial scarcity.<br/><br/>Now if the argument is one based on labour or time spent in producing the work in question, then asking them to pay twice is seen through pretty quickly as well.<br/><br/>The RPG market is not huge.  Many games sell in sufficiently low quantities that the best marketing is often the maker of the game letting people know about it directly.  It also allows the game maker and those who enjoy what they make to be part of the same community or have some form of a relationship.  It's pretty much the best possible defense against lost revenues due to piracy.  Having a relationship with the people who use your product means they are more likely to see you as a person and want to support your efforts directly.  But it also means that if you charge them for something that is infinitely reproducible with a click of a mouse after you've already charged them for a print copy, you'll end up with the people who like your product feeling like they are not being treated like a person.

And you showed in your paragraph that you do think in terms of scarcity on at least some level because you talked about getting "access".<br/><br/>All creative works that can be easily transferred into a digital medium need to have artificial scarcity attached to them.  Copyright provides some of that scarcity.  As does controlling distribution.  As does building a relationship/community with the audience.

(Some) creators want to be paid, and because of the essential zero marginal cost of producing digital goods, lower prices are an option, and the arbitrariness of price is more apparent.  Whatever price is set determines how many buy, which determines how 'scarce' it is.<br/><br/>You see the same sort of effect in books (initial higher priced hardcovers), prescription drugs, electronics, or anything that has a large cost to create and low cost to duplicate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409573/#Comment_409573" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T06:53:43+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  6:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>How do you make a version that isn't public, though?

When you set the print book up on Lulu, you can make it Public (anyone can find it by searching), Private (you're the only one who can buy copies), or restricted (I forget what the actual term for this is, but it means that one can only buy copies if they know the URL).</blockquote>\nThis is susceptible to people passing around the URL, or posting it on the internet.  But I'd hope no one does that to you.</blockquote>\nYeah, I thought about that, too. But the I have to consider the various options:<br/><br/>a) Sell pdf for one price, print+pdf for another. People who want both are happy to make one transaction, people who pirated the pdf still pay the full price if they then decide to get the print, but people who bought the pdf and then realize they want the print feel like they're being "double-dipped," right?<br/><br/>b) Do what Rafael does. Sure, people could share the URL, and then pirate the pdf, so they are paying less for print+pdf than they are in the above example. But people who bought the pdf just to check it out and then realize they want a print copy feel like you are giving them a good deal. This sounds like it might be a good idea for first-time publishers, or people whose products don't have much of a rep? Like, what if you did this for the first six months or something and then after word gets around it's a quality product, take the discounted version down so it doesn't get pirated? Or would people maybe get angry about missing that deal?<br/><br/>c) And the other option would be to just treat them as separate things and charge for them separately.

Yes, today, technically you <i>could</i> just type a bunch of stuff into a Word document, choose Print -&gt; Save as PDF, and be done with minimal labor and (supposedly) zero cost, but that is hardly the level of publication that anyone's been talking about, as far as I can tell. Page/book layout is labor. <i>Good</i> page/book design can be a lot of work. Some of you are saying "well you have to create the PDF anyhow for the printers to manufacture physical books, so the PDF is essentially a free by-product." This is backwards. The book is an extra which costs more for the physical materials and the labor of physical production and delivery; but all of that labor to create the document that is printed as a book is still <i>labor</i>. Not to mention the costs of having the computer hardware and software for writing, page layout, and PDF creation, plus the costs of data storage and Internet connection and bandwidth so you can make the PDF available whether or not you're also printing it as a physical book. (And further ignoring time and effort and costs spent in imagining, writing, editing, proofreading, creating/commissioning artwork\u2026)<br/><br/>The initial labor and costs are all connected to this supposedly minimal labor, essentially zero cost PDF. Regardless of whether you're choosing to create a physical book as the end result, the labor and costs are incurred. That doesn't mean you <i>must</i> charge for the PDF; as already discussed, there are different options for how you want to distribute your work and different reasons for doing so. But the concept of PDFs being a "free" promotional/added-value extra is a holdover from the business model that presumes everyone wants a physical book and only a limited number of customers will find a PDF useful (or even preferable), based on earlier times when that was the case. Today, it may not be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409636/#Comment_409636" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T17:03:12+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  5:03PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Phil said.

DrivethruRPG uses a watermarking system that puts the customer's information into the file.  They do a few watermarkings, the customer's IP and then also put a uniquely generated hash tag into the file as well.  The problem with that is that PDF security is a joke, with both linux and Mac OS being able to strip it natively and Windows such a capability is only a download away.  Then the pirate will:<br/><br/>1) Remove the watermark images<br/>2) do a find &amp; replace on the document for their IP address<br/>3) strip out all metadata and non-essential data from the file<br/><br/>If they are extra careful they will also:<br/><br/>4) print the document and capture the printer spool's output, completely obliterating any data that is not part of how the document is displayed<br/>5) convert the printer spool info back into a PDF, restoring the text and bookmarks manually as part of the process<br/>6) be confident that even if they missed their IP address somewhere that they used a VPN to hide their true IP<br/>7) be confident that even if there's a unique identifier that they missed, they used a convenience store prepaid credit card and a fake name<br/><br/>One route some publishers have gone is to go with a dedicated app on a smart phone/tablet where you can only read the work after you buy the app and only when connected to the internet so that what you paid for is verified every time you use the file.  But the same software used to develop this is available to the pirates and the most locked down app-only publications also appear on pirate sites after the content is captured, cleaned and converted.  <br/><br/>Every time some new approach to stopping piracy comes up, it attracts pirates to the challenge.  It's part of the hobby of being a pirate to overcome challenges like new technology.<br/><br/>Your best defense is to form a relationship with the end user.

I run a print shop, actually, and my wife works for a small publisher (unrelated to games). The difficulty of setting up a pdf for distribution pales in comparison with setting up a separate epub or mobi file, for most publishers. That's why I dismiss the 'extra labor costs' as justifying a separate price/sale in the case of a pdf. But I'm <i>not</i> saying there is no justification of a separate sale, quite the opposite: In my mind, <b>the pdf is actually a different product with different uses than a printed book, and that's what makes it worthwhile as a separate purchase.</b> How that's handled is up to the individual releasing the book, obviously, and I have preferences there as a consumer... but I consider all models valid. <br/><br/>Giving someone an infinitely-reproducible, weightless, digital copy sure sounds like a different product to me. So I think it's kinda interesting that a lot of consumers feel entitled to the free pdf upon print purchase. Very few people feel entitled to a free print copy after buying the pdf... It's like we're stuck in a sort of yesteryear model where printed works are "real" and digital works are not, even though digital distribution is increasingly becoming the de facto 'normal.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410122/#Comment_410122" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T13:04:22+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  1:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2013 1:04PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to try to sell to consumers who think like I do, I'd have to go with one of the following two options: (a) PDF + print bundle only, at a price that covers both, or (b) PDF for free, and a print version whose price covers PDF + print.<br/><br/>But it seems that most customers do <i>not</i> think like I do.

You also have people like Nail Gaiman and Radiohead who have experimented with giving their work away for free and found that, via "name your price" and sales of physical product, it has actually made them money. Of course, whenever examples like that are trotted out it is always counter-argued that that only works for artists who are already well established and it can be argued until the cows come home one way or the other. I merely put it out there because I think it's worth thinking about.<br/><br/>As someone who has only recently discovered the indie scene, I'm somewhat in love with it. But I've been struck by what I perceive to be the lack of business sense within it. The last ten years has seen a renaissance of RPG design in which so many of the problems inherent in "trad" gaming have been solved, but it's failed to make its mark. I don't think people fully realise the potential gold mine the indie scene is sitting on if it only found a way to infiltrate the mainstream. While it might seem vulgar to talk about it in such capitalist terms, that means thousands, maybe millions, more people getting into the hobby and exploring their ideas and expressing themselves. I think that's a worthy goal to shoot for.<br/><br/>I've written all that at the risk of veering off topic because I think the bigger picture is worth thinking about when considering issues like print vs PDF. All too often, I fear that people focus on the little picture. They see lots of people getting hold of pirates PDFs and see lost revenue and people (to use the term the music industry has abused) "stealing" from them. What they don't see is the fact that many of those people may be simply getting a PDF of a book they've already bought, might struggle to find a legitimate place to buy the book, or might end up leading to future sales of legitimate product due to word of mouth.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, I prefer to buy all my books from my FLGS. My particular, FLGS, Leisure Games in London, is heaving every Saturday with young gamers who sit around tables right next to the shop's well stocked and appealing indie games section. It's very clear to me that by helping to keep that shop open I'm helping indie publishers sell product to a new audience they would otherwise lack.<br/><br/>All too often, I'm frustrated in this because the book is out of print or simply not available for retail. Neither should be happening; POD is now a reality (and whatever the margins are, they're better than no sale at all) and from what I've seen, game store distribution is in a rather healthy state right now.<br/><br/>I find it incredibly frustrating when I can't get the PDF bundled with the physical book. Nine times out of ten, I go onto buy a separate PDF. But I would remind you of my above statement: I'm in love with the indie scene right now; for me, it's totally worth it. But I won't always feel that way, and I certainly won't necesarily always be in as good a financial position as I am now; both are subject to change. I suspect that anyone not bundling, and certainly not participating in the Bits and Mortar scheme, is missing out on a lot of potential sales.<br/><br/>I've read a lot in this thread about how producing PDFs is not cost-free. That's all valid, although a) most modern publishing software makes a lot of the processes involved quite simple and b) relatively few indie PDFs I've purchased bother with things like comprehensive indexes, print friendly formats, and so on. But crucially, those are fixed costs; the marginal costs are clearly much lower. Let's not get carried away here.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd urge self-publishers to see PDFs as an opportunity not a threat, but also to recognise that to ensure that it truly is an opportunity you need to ensure your print versions are readily available via retail (with Bits and Mortar) and POD. I'd also encourage you to think about the value added you can get from print and physical product. I got the burlap bag edition of Joe McDaldno's The Quiet Year in the post the other day and I simply adore it; it contains pretty much everything you need (apart from pencils and paper) to start playing the game right away, in package in keeping with the look and feel of the game. All RPGs should be packaged like that.<br/><br/>Add prominent tip jars on your websites and take a leaf out of Jason Morningstar's book (literally) and include a page in all your PDFs encouraging people to financially support the game. Don't worry about people getting your stuff for free but, equally, don't be embarrassed about asking them to make a contribution. I know Amanda Palmer irritates some peope, but she has a point: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking.html</a><br/><br/>Sorry for going on for too long; I just think there's a huge amount of untapped potential that won't be realised if people are too precious about "protecting" their intellectual property. Worse, I think it is counterproductive in the longer term and leads to too many brilliant games languishing in a self imposed ghetto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410250/#Comment_410250" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T14:30:52+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  2:30PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The dreams of indie RPGs taking over mainstream RPGs or even breaking out of prior RPG audiences into the wider world have existed for many decades.

Even web comics which have been around for ages suddenly get more credibility once they're put into physical form. And the most you can ask for virtual is around $1 to $5 (thanks to app stores like Apple's), even if it's equivalent to a 400+ page book.<br/><br/>Places like DTRPG are an exception because it has a culture supporting it. But without that, the customer will not value the <i>labor</i> involved. That's why it's important for visual or literary artists to have a relationship with their supporters. Rarely will a work speak for itself, and even when it does it's cash value is still a product of how the customer feels about the artist/culture.<br/><br/>The model that the internet best supports for RPGs is to write/release often and provide early access. This is because you cannot control who accesses your work once released, and RPGs tend to (and are often designed to) have a crappy shelf life. And that makes me sad, because I don't think that's the best model to support quality.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410857/#Comment_410857" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T11:48:18+00:00" title="March 30, 2013 11:48AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I got the burlap bag edition of Joe McDaldno's The Quiet Year in the post the other day and I simply adore it; it contains pretty much everything you need (apart from pencils and paper) to start playing the game right away, in package in keeping with the look and feel of the game. All RPGs should be packaged like that.<br/></blockquote>\nWoah, brakes.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for the kind words. I'm really proud of the bagged set of The Quiet Year.<br/><br/>But not all games should be packaged like that. DEFINITELY NOT. All games should be packaged in whatever way the creator wants to and is capable of packaging them.<br/><br/>That product was an exhausting one to complete. The process was rife with potential problems, and I'd not recommend someone attempt to do something like this for their first game (because mistakes cost money). The product only became viable at 500 copies, which is way more than most indie story games actually sell. The aesthetic of an unmarked burlap bag worked for The Quiet Year, thank god, because printed boxes are hella expensive and putting my game in one would have jacked the final retail price up to $50-60.<br/><br/>Doing a boxed set is exhausting. I did a full year of publishing homework before launching that kickstarter. I know that Ross basically put a full-time year of his life into developing and publishing the Serpent's Tooth boxed set.<br/><br/>It's also... just one cool option among many. It makes the game more accessible to the non-hardcore, but less accessible to folks with limited spending money. Folks should follow their hearts when publishing games. If your primary goal is to sell as many copies as possible to the widest audience possible, a boxed set might be a vehicle for realizing that goal. But there is no consensus on what our goals are. There hopefully never will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410886/#Comment_410886" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T18:07:13+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  6:07PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love boxed sets sooo much.
