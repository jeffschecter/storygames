                    I'm putting together a conflict resolution mechanic based on a simplified version of Heroquest.<br/><br/>I'm looking for suggestions, advice, critiques, but not brickbats.<br/><br/><code><br/>When two characters come into conflict, use the following steps:<br/><br/>First, set clear stakes. Declare what each character's goals are, and what methods he is using to obtain them.<br/><br/>Each player chooses which trait his character will be using in the conflict, plus bonuses or penalties for additional traits or descriptors.<br/><br/>When a trait is used for a bonus, it adds 10% of its value to the roll; traits from 1 to 14 add +1, 15 to 24 add +2, etc.<br/><br/>After all the traits are added up, each player adds the result of a 1d20 roll to his total.<br/><br/>A roll of 20 is counted as 40; a roll of 1 is counted as -20.<br/><br/>Subtract the smaller total from the larger. This is the success margin. Each 20 points in the success margin adds one flair to the success.<br/><br/>The winner narrates the outcome of the conflict. Each flair permits the winner of the conflict to add one detail illustrating how his character dominates the situation.<br/><br/>In combat, flairs can be used to inflict wounds, disarm, or gain advantage.<br/><br/>A wound is a Flaw that has a rating equal to the number of flairs used in its creation multiplied by 10. The character who receives this wound must immediately make an EndureHardship check (defaulting to 13 if the character does not already have it) with a resistance equal to the flaw's value to avoid being knocked unconscious. (See TreatWounds)<br/><br/>If a character is disarmed, then he loses access to that belonging trait until he wins a conflict with the goal of retrieving the belonging.<br/><br/>An advantage is a Trait that has a rating equal to the number of flairs used in its creation multiplied by 20. This trait only applies to follow-up conflicts; when a new scene is started, the trait is removed. Flairs can be used to remove advantages as well, on the same scale; each flair removes 20 points from the advantage.<br/><br/>After a conflict has been rolled and resolved, a follow-up conflict may be started if either character wishes to go another round.<br/></code> </div>

                            I'm confused about this: as far as I can tell, it's just a game where you add modifiers onto a d20 roll (with special values for 1 and 20).  Why are the traits rated in double digits when only the first digit matters?  You could divide all values by ten (round down) and get the same game with less math.                        </div>

                            It's not a whole game.  It's a conflict resolution mechanic.<br/>
<br/>
The traits are rated in double digits because the primary trait in a challenge is given its full value.<br/>
<br/>
Jean-Luc is fencing with Ambrose.<br/>
<br/>
Jean-Luc has "Saber and main-gauche fighting" at 34, and additional bonuses for "Agile" +2 and "Finely crafted saber" +3.  His total in the conflict is 39+1d20.<br/>
<br/>
Ambrose has "Rapier fighting" at 31, and additional bonuses for "In love with Selene" +3 and "Practices wrist exercises daily" +2.  HIs total is 36+1d20.                        </div>

                            Conceptually that seems pretty workable, though it took your example of how large you expect base skills to be to give a sense of why you wanted a die with so much spread.  Even with that, steps of 20 seems awkward, so is there a specific reason you're operating on that scale (rather than, say, a single d10 roll)?<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, the big question that jumps to mind is what happens when there are more than 2 sides in the conflict?<br/>

                            Well, I used the scale I've got because Heroquest works on exactly the same scale.  Mathematically, you could convert a Heroquest character to this one just by changing all the masteries into 20-point bonuses to the original roll.<br/>
<br/>
It could just as easily work on d10's or even d6's.<br/>
<br/>
As for multiple sides, it only needs to be "fixed" when you've got three or more characters, each with mutually exclusive goals; if there are any "isolatable" goals in the scene then those can be resolved separately. <br/>
<br/>
If that happens, then what I'd do is have all but the highest two totals used to produce bonuses for the second-highest; if the highest is lower than the total of the second highest and the bonuses from the remainder, then everyone fails to achieve their goals in a kind of Sicilian standoff.  The highest narrates how the whole thing falls apart and noone gets what they want.                        </div>

                            Can I just clarify? If I win by less than 20 points, I get to narrate the outcome of the situation, but not narrate any flairs?<br/><br/>When I narrate the outcome of the situation, am I specifically banned from narrating anything about how my character dominates the situation <i>unless</i> it's a flair? So if I have one flair to narrate, and I say "I knock you to the ground and kick your sword out of your hand", could you veto that on the grounds that I narrated two ways my character dominated the situation? <br/><br/>As a slightly more wanky question: can I use stakes like this?<br/><br/><i>You: My goal is stealing your purse without you noticing.<br/>Me: OK. My goal is killing you dead.<br/>You: Er...OK...I withdraw the challenge.</i><br/><br/>Or, rather, how does the negotiation over stakes take place? Can I narrate a goal that I might not really have the skills to do: "My goal is to knock you unconscious, by swinging from the chandelier and hitting you across the back of the head with my blackjack"?<br/><br/>There you go. Loads of nitpicking questions.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            When you narrate the outcome, and you get no flairs, then all you get is your stakes, and nothing else of significance.  If your stakes were "If I win, I knock you to the ground and kick your sword out of your hand" then that's what you get.  If you get flairs, then you might add "The sword gets stuck in the crotch of a tree nearby, about ten feet up" or "The kick bruises your arm" or "Angelina sees the conflict and loses some respect for you, and I get an advantage in the follow-up conflict over who she chooses to accompany to the ball."<br/>
<br/>
Negotiation over stakes isn't something that this mechanic covers.  I don't think I've ever seen a mechanic for it that goes beyond "Don't be a dick" so I don't know what one would look like.  Personally, I've never been in a game where it has been an issue.   This mechanic assumes that stakes are already decided.<br/>
<br/>
Narrating results assumes a certain amount of respect by the players for the continuity of all the characters, especially PC's.  Again, the "Don't be a dick" clause of the social contract would apply.                        </div>
