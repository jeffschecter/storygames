                    I sat in on an IRC game that a FOAF was running.<br/>
<br/>
Ambush is eighteen years old, and GMing on IRC for the first time.  I lurked in the game, and saw that it was limping along pretty badly.  I decided to see if he'd be interested in some pointers...<br/>
<br/>
Here's a snippet of the conversation:<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, so what you seem to be saying, is that the players are the ones whose job it is to make the game interesting, and that you only step in when they fail, and the game gets boring, right?<br/>
 sorta<br/>
 Okay, how am I missing?<br/>
 when they start getting side tracked, i step in<br/>
 Side tracked?  Side tracked from what?<br/>
 whatever track they try to go down<br/>
 Huh?<br/>
 You're going to have to explain that one to me.<br/>
 later<br/>

<p>I donno. Looks quite the opposite to me. Looks like he's waiting for players to provide focus and intends on keeping them focused on whatever it is that <em>they</em> wanted to do. But he doesn't do anything to set them in motion if the just flounder about aimlessly, which looks like the reason the game is limping.</p>

<i>We seriously need an academy for GMing.</i><br/><br/>Or perhaps, games that better tell the GM what they're supposed to be doing.  There's a million different ways to game, in a fun way, as much as there's a million possible games you can play with a ball- <i>as long as everyone can get on the same page</i>.<br/><br/>Typically the players have their own ideas, the GM has her or his own ideas, and most groups assume they've all come to do the same thing without confirmation.<br/><br/>Of course he can't explain what a "track" is, because odds are pretty good he lacks the tools to communicate it to the players, or pick up whatever the players are also looking for.  He has a nebulous idea, unbacked by experience, instilled by many games that have told him if he masters task resolution a game will magically form, as much as mixing organic chemicals together spontaneously creates life. <br/><br/>Aside from ramming someone through 5 years of theory, or getting them to grasp Flags (before input, or Social Contract), I usually rather just have someone play Inspectres... then work from there.                        </div>
