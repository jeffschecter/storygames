Featuring the arbitrary architecture of the 8 Rules of Improv, we begin by discussing an old Gamestas favorite, trust. With anecdotes from the stage and applications to the table, this is the one-eyed leading the blind and having fun doing it, so come along with me and Jason in <a href="http://thecollectivegames.com/blog/category/ftgpod/" rel="nofollow">Finding the Game</a>.<br/><br/>Tyler<br/><a href="http://www.thecollectivegames.com" rel="nofollow">thecollectivegames.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307576/#Comment_307576" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T17:27:15+00:00" title="January  9, 2011  5:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a real treat. I like the story sharing the stage with Del Close's group. The point about people coming from tabletop with an adversarial attitude toward the GM or storyteller having some culture clash with improv'rs is a good one too. <br/><br/>And I think there's something about hogging the scene or blocking other folks from letting their character have good spotlight is something that may come up more in less obvious ways in longer improvised live play. It's easy to get caught in character, and have something you want to do, and lose track of what the other players around you may need for their character to shine too. Balancing your insights and continuing to be aware of the others can be a not-obvious thing, especially to less experienced or folks not socialized with the improve rules. <br/><br/>I look forward to future 'casts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307578/#Comment_307578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T17:34:28+00:00" title="January  9, 2011  5:34PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Tyler, that's interesting stuff.

I'll bring it to Jason's attention and see what his experiences with this in the long form are like.  My only experience in which I could relate to this was in LARP and in that setting I wasn't always concerned with bringing out or highlighting aspects of other people's characters.  I was younger than everyone else playing, so I wanted perform and show that I belonged, but looking back the scenes I liked the best were the ones where I respected the person playing across me and I honored their contributions.  <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Thanks, Tyler, that's interesting stuff.

We had some talks about this, and we don't agree with it either.  I think we'll end up focusing on questions that add to the scene and questions that just defer creative responsibility.<br/><br/>Tyler                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307621/#Comment_307621" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T07:03:19+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  7:03AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the thought behind the rule is good.
