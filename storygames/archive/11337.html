The game we played was insane, hilarious and off the wall crazy. It was like some weird Anime Looney Toons cartoon from bizaro world. Even the sexual stuff that showed up (nothing graphic or explicit) wasn't weird and came off more funny and awkward then creepy.

The overtly sexual connotations of 'French Maids' combined with it's 'cute' (moe, to use the lexicon) anime stylings seem to market it exclusively at young men.

At least the Finnish translation of<em>MLwM</em>specifically states that the Master must<em>always</em>be an unmarried man. By contrast, the Master in<em>Maid</em>can be practically anyone (or any<em>thing</em>) with some source of influence and power, and the rules include no default assumptions about this authority figure's sex or gender. Most of the examples in the text are female, and the play reports feature<em>one</em>male Master, an eleven-year-old boy.<br/></blockquote>\nI just had to check this, being that I'm responsible for editing the Finnish text. Here's the English-language MLwM in the part I think Janne means:<br/>"Masters are always single. Perhaps widowed. Perhaps engaged. But never currently married."<br/>And the Finnish:<br/>"Is\xe4nn\xe4t ovat aina naimattomia. Ehk\xe4 leski\xe4. Kenties kihloissa. Mutta eiv\xe4t koskaan juuri nyt naimisissa."<br/><br/>Both of those imply gender only insofar as "Master" is a gendered word in both languages. The Finnish term "Is\xe4nt\xe4" specifically means the master of a household as opposed to a master of a craft, which has a different word in Finnish. Maybe Janne misremembered because in Finnish, unlike English, the corresponding female word "em\xe4nt\xe4" means the female master (or co-master) of a household, unlike the English word "mistress", which is more often used in a subservient way. ("Rakastajatar" would be the Finnish word for a love-mistress of a man.)<br/><br/>But anyway, that's a different topic. The point to me seems to be that Maid seems to get a lot of defence by the way of nit-picking the text of the game. I don't think this is very fair towards Judd and others who dislike the game - it's like saying that they don't know how to interpret what they read. I find that if I have to choose between considering Maid a perverse sex game or pretending that it doesn't really mean to be kinky, I'll have to go with the former as being closer to the truth. The fact that you can use the game for non-kinky purposes, and the fact that the game's text has no overt pornographic tones, do not together mean that Judd is unfair in characterizing the game as having erotic overtones. The same goes for the whole maid phenomenon, by the way - you'd need to be blind to the subtext to claim that it's not a sexual fetish, and you'd similarly need to be blind to claim that the Maid rpg doesn't gesture towards that same fetish with its contents. It's all well and good that actual play is not pornographic, but rather comedic and adventurous; that's what I'd expect of any product in the ecchi genre, and that's what I'd definitely expect of a roleplaying crew - it'd be pretty weird to gather the guys together for a shared session of overtly sexual maid fetish narration, frankly. But saying that the fetish is not a motive force behind the game's imagery and genre is just stupid.<br/><br/>Judd: You well deserve to have an opinion, but what you wrote up there is, in fact, prudery of the sort you said that it's not. Might be just a culture thing, but I don't expect each and every product that makes a passing reference or even bases itself onto a sexual subculture to have a large "adults only" warning plastered over it. It's just not that big a deal, and I personally doubt that children are going to get hurt by it. (Could be wrong, just my opinion, etc.) Human sexuality is and has always been a strong driving force behind all sorts of artistic creativity, and the results tend to make their way into mainstream polite culture in time. The Maid roleplaying game is just a couple of naughty non-explicit jokes away from such mainstream phenomena as <i>Bratz</i> dolls; definitely still recognizable as being based on a sexual fetish, but not directly sexual itself any more than dryads or succubi in D&amp;D are.<br/><br/>(The child porn angle is more troublesome by far here - if it's OK with you, I'll just skip it in favour of arguing about the general position of sexuality in polite society, unless you want to concede the above point and focus on how wrong and sick Maid is for mixing children with sexual imagery and situations. They're a bit separate issues, as I see it.)<br/><br/>In summation, though, let me say that I'm 100% OK with Judd disliking the game for its kinkiness, and I do recognize that we differ only on a matter of taste. I do agree with him that it is kinky, no amount of selective reading and creative drifting in actual play really gets over the sexual innuendo evident in the game text in many places. I just don't personally see any great aesthetic or ethical problem in Maid's kinkiness. Something like <a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/bacchanal.html" rel="nofollow">Bacchanal</a> is much more problematic in that regard - the latter has a maturity warning in my webstore, while the former does not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251796/#Comment_251796" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T11:34:12+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 11:34AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>But don't worry about any of that, because we don't have any problematic sexism in our sub-culture.</blockquote>\nI think this is an important point.

Let's get some basic facts straight.<br/><br/>Maid doesn't gender the master. The examples are well over %50 female masters. The english term "master" is, of course, a translation of a Japanese term, but as far as I know the Japanese term is also slightly gendered male [edit: I am told by someone who knows the language that it is heavily gendered male]. Nonetheless, the game goes out of its way to say that the master can be any gender whatsoever.<br/><br/>Maid does gender the maids, expliclitly. There are rules for two character types that are male (stewards and butlers) in a supplement. They're secondary and supplemental and I'll consider them in a bit.<br/><br/>For contrast, MLwM does gender the Master male (and unmarried). It does not gender the minions.<br/><br/>Andy's whole story about indie dudes was great but I have a hunch it's a lie. I've never heard of anyone's Maid game going to a dark place that they didn't want and touching them in a private area. It's pretty hard to play Maid and *not* get the premise. Which is that the Maids are the only characters with real agency.<br/><br/>If you find Maid icky, I would like you to take a moment and check yourself. Is it because you are inherently grossed out by the idea of Maid fetish? Then it's not for you please move along. Is it because it's coming from a culture which you have certain stereotypical expectations from? Then take a second and imagine it was written by Vincent Baker and think about what he would mean by it. (Ryo Kamiya, the designer of Maid, is about %50 smarter than Vincent but we'll do this for now.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251800/#Comment_251800" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T11:35:45+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 11:35AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Euro,<br/><br/>How many times do I have to write that I do not dislike the game for its kinkiness?<br/><br/>How many times?<br/><br/>You tell me how many times I have to write it and I will decide if it is worth typing it that many times.<br/><br/>Fuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251801/#Comment_251801" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T11:37:03+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 11:37AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2010 11:38AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>(The child porn angle is more troublesome by far here - if it's OK with you, I'll just skip it in favour of arguing about the general position of sexuality in polite society...<br/><br/>In summation, though, let me say that I'm 100% OK with Judd disliking the game for its kinkiness...</blockquote>\nSo, you're going to dismiss his main concern about the game, and then tell him that, with that dismissed, his concern about the game (which you are now making up out your ass) isn't really valid.<br/><br/>Really?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251802/#Comment_251802" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T11:38:05+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 11:38AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2010 11:39AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for starting this thread, Judd!

Thank God," and decided right then I was going to support it. I mean, it's interesting to me how many games are about murder, have elaborate rules for murder, and murder occurs to them as a matter of course. But that's not creepy. Or at least you won't find a thread that's like, "Guys, I picked up Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd on a whim, and... well.. there's an awful lot of violence and murder in it. Does anyone else find that creepy?" The game does have actiony, cartoony fighting in it, but it lacks the general roleplaying game market's fascination with killing other beings. <br/><br/>I never, at any point, picked up the game because I wanted to fuck a maid. I do not sexually fetishize maids. I could go on and elaborate but I'm not sure how much anyone in this forum cares about my actual sexual interests, but I did not buy this as a sex game. I got it as a fun, goofy game about a subgenre of anime with which I am vaguely familiar. And I know you said that you're not concerned about kinkiness, but that's not even why I bought or would play the game and I know others have expressed that discomfort.<br/><br/>Anecdotally, the people I know personally who have been the most aggressive about me running it for them have been females and one homosexual male, some anime fans but some not. The non-anime fans were people who do not care for the action fantasy sci fi murder games that are most RPGs. The people I know who have been dismissive of it or creeped out by it have been straight men.<br/><br/>I have unfortunately not gotten to play it, but I did get to hear about how a session of it ran at a college gaming con I attend every year. There was lots of cartoon wackiness and comic mayhem, battling of aliens, blowing random things up with missile launchers, etc. Every year the demographic of the convention shifts and more women are attending, and we end up seeing fewer fantasy murder games, and more games like this or that game about lawyer animals that dance.<br/><br/>My recommendation to perhaps decreepify yourself about this game is find someone who is actually excited about the game that you know in real life and ask them why they are excited about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251806/#Comment_251806" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T11:44:31+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 11:44AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero Tuovinen wrote: <i>Both of those imply gender only insofar as "Master" is a gendered word in both languages.

How is one supposed to take that?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is obviously an important thing for you - and emotional as well? Obviously something larger going on here. Reading the cross-posted stuff, I'd say that what we should be discussing here might be the issue of how Maid is responsible as part of the roleplaying culture for how it's going to be interpreted as its representative - does that sound right to you? Seems from some of those points that you're worried and annoyed by how a hobby already so mired in misogyny could be a platform for another game that so objectifies women. If that's the point here, then I have to say that I can see how that can be annoying. I don't find Maid nearly as offensive as the usual range of rpg cheesecake, though, because it is based on a well-established prior genre of comedy, which it handles with comedic grace. Getting angry at it for being sexist is like getting angry at a roleplaying game focused on music hall theatrical culture - music hall sure is sexist, but is that any reason to be angry at a roleplaying game that tackles the topic neutrally and smartly?<br/><br/>Or maybe - should I ask if I'm allowed to disagree at all here?

A RPG might have something, only 10% of the book, that we go, "YES!" And run with that with our friends. Someone else is looking at all the parts of the book we ignored and ask, "How can you do that?" To which the person playing the game and having a great time can honestly say, "But that's not what the game <i>is</i>."

Do you want to discuss the way Maid uses underage characters in innuendo? It is a valid concern, I think, but not something that can be tackled without finding common ground on whether <i>any</i> sexuality or sexism at all is bad here, or if the game would actually be fine if not for using under-age characters now and then.<br/><br/>Also: Agreed with Bret, my experience mirrors his. I find the whole idea that women are great enemies of the maid genre laughable in the light of my own experiences. Maybe they should be - it's an interesting topic to discuss, anyway - but the real world doesn't seem to work that way: people get their kicks from all sorts of things, and if Maid seems cute and fun to them with or without sexual overtones, who are we to gainsay?<br/><br/>Also times two: let's slow down here, I at least have to get to other things soon.

I'll expand a little bit more on what I mean by that:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Oh, by the way, this game about young teen maids</blockquote>\nAs far as I can tell, by looking at the art and looking at some of the free supplements and hearing about the rules from people who seem to know them, there's nothing there that indicates that the maids are substantially young or teenaged.<br/><br/>That's why I mean when I say it's a matter of taste.  You look at a piece of art and say, "Look, it's obvious that that character is a young teen!"  I look at it and say, "Hunh; that's not obvious to me at all."  And I don't think there's anywhere constructive for the conversation to go from that point.<br/><br/><br/>I guess the other thing I mean is that the underlying issue of creepiness is, to me at least, essentially an aesthetic concern.  Cockroaches just creep me right the hell out, they're creepy little dudes.  It's not like I'm going to have some rational discourse with a cockroach expert and that'll convince me that they're not creepy.  I'm not passing any sort of moral judgment on the insects.

Some women would be aghast, others would not.<br/><br/>I wasn't trying to make that one post about women and their views, just grabbing at it. Men go to movies and have different reactions to different things as well  For some men I know, the movie TAKEN was all about ugly, stupid xenophobia. For others was a guy fantasy where a father was able to live out the fantasy of how far he'd go to protect his daughter.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to speak for women -- and I'm not.  I'm pointing out an obvious yet always ignored truth -- how I, or you, or anyone -- see the world or worry about things or are offended by or are turned on by -- is not the same for the other seven billion people on the plant. <br/><br/>With RPGs we take away our own specific agendas and turn them into active procedures. So one person looking at the rule book might not have any idea what specific players liked about the game or are doing with it.  Which was Bret's point. And it was, I think, a good one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251822/#Comment_251822" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T12:03:22+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 12:03PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Christopher.

In Japan, this rule doesn't hold true at all. For example, Elfien Lied and Berserk both feature nudity and extreme gore. So if you ever do have a daughter... if its from Japan, preview with caution.<br/><br/>I personally find the game creepy based off the types of people I've seen playing it or talking about it at the local hobby shops. But I can also see myself having a lot of fun playing it (as long as there was no sexual themes in the game, which makes me extremely uncomfortable). I won't ever play it, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251849/#Comment_251849" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T13:02:56+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:02PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Andy's whole story about indie dudes was great but I have a hunch it's a lie</blockquote>\nNope.<br/><br/>One of those games was me running a quick demo session for Jason M, even (ask him!). It wasn't one that was all that dark (those were at GenCon and another con game that I pulled the plug on under the guise of it "being a demo; you can see how it works, got an idea of the game? OK cool, I gotta run to another session kthxbye"), but it kinda broke because, unfamiliar with the tropes of "you stay in your role (here I mean social role, maid) and ham it it, but never leave that role", so it kinda ended awkwardly when Jason's character simply /wouldn't stand for being a maid/, and instead took over the mansion. Overall, it was an ok session but ended awkwardly as we were hitting the rules but not the feel of the game.<br/><br/>Now, to contrast, the last session I ran was at an anime convention with something like 6 players, one of them S-G's own TonyLB. If you know Tony and his "Muy Macho" RPG style, you know how he rolls: He wants to be hit, and hit others, with in-your-face backstabby drama. The game with Tony went just like any other game that I've run for anime fans/normal RPers. Tony turned up the juice with some PvP stuff to make the game interesting, but he totally didn't step over the common ground of the game: Stabbing the master, nuking the mansion, tearing the system down, and so on. Reason: He gets anime/manga, knows how it work, and played entirely within those lines (even his PvP-ing style was totally normal in the confines of an anime). <br/><br/>The central problem might be "do you get/know anime or not?" If Yes, then the game goes off regularly regardless of how you normally play. If No, but you're familiar with comedy/zany RP-ing, again no real problem. But if you're looking for hardcore macho gaming and don't really care about the conventions of the media/setting, then that's where those problems occured.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>MLwM's text does not gender the master as far as I can tell.</blockquote>\nNeither does Maid: It uses "Master", "Male Master", "Female Master", etc. It's just the convention of the word as pulled from the Japanese version, as it is a word for the archetype of the "Maid/Mistress" role: We didn't use the word Mistress through the book (although, yeah, a Female Master == Mistress) probably because we didn't think about it at the time, but now it would be weird to write "Master/Mistress" every occurance of the word (maybe in a future edition, a footnote that "Master is a word that refers to the archeype portrayed by male masters and female mistresses" or somesuch). As mentioned, most of the examples in the book feature female masters. In the games I've run where I've chosen the gender, I pretty much alternate (favoring young/innocent/weak male masters that need to be protected usually).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251851/#Comment_251851" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T13:10:33+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, that's kinda interesting Andy, because it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately.<br/>Wouldn't you say the system should (OK maybe not should but...something) help players ''get'' the game even with them not being familiar with anime and manga?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251852/#Comment_251852" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T13:13:50+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:13PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>(maybe in a future edition, a footnote that "Master is a word that refers to the archeype portrayed by male masters and female mistresses" or somesuch)</blockquote>Householder?

It was never geared towards children. I was even considering posting an "ESRB Rating" "T+ for Teens" on the spine with the barcode-reasons ("Comic Violence" "Adult Themes" "Tobacco Use") on the back. Thing though, in the low numbers it's selling (only recently broke 1000 in pdf/book sales between Direct sales and IPR), the avenues we're selling through (IPR, face-to-face; not Waldenbooks or Barnes and Noble), it never felt needed. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>It is Maid in its context on a game shelf next to D&amp;D and Vampire.</blockquote>\nPut it on the shelf with the manga books, instead. It's tamer than half the stuff there (which admittedly will often feature warnings based on content on the front/back cover), including the manga aimed for young/teen girls. And still tamer than half the US comics as well: Wanted, Y the Last Man or Preacher have far more horrifying content... but you're right, they all feature "Suggested for Mature Readers" label on the back, it might be time to look into posting such a label on Maid as well...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251856/#Comment_251856" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T13:17:30+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>You know, that's kinda interesting Andy, because it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately.<br/>Wouldn't you say the system should (OK maybe not should but...something) help players ''get'' the game even with them not being familiar with anime and manga?</blockquote>\nWhy?<br/><br/>First off, *everyone* in Japan is familiar with anime and manga, outside of maybe a few remote mountain villages where they're just now realizing that it's not the Tokugawa Shogunate anymore.

How do you tell someone who never watched any serial dramas (or refuses to watch them) what is special about them, without writing a second book on the subject 4 times larger and detailed than the game?<br/><br/>And so on. Too much work for zero - ZERO - returns.<br/><br/>EDIT: Re your followup on "Gaiman and Baker". Hell yeah, make that a recommended reading list in the intro to the game (and maybe a footnote about what to emphasize in play), and know full well that people will ignore it, try to play it anyway, and fail.<br/><br/>At the beginning of Maid, Ewen compiled a list of rec reading manga and anime, and we both put some footnotes of things to emphasize in play. And we have no control if people want to pick it up and play it without having read/seen the media, or listen to the play advice.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251864/#Comment_251864" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T13:26:12+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:26PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone from a game store once told me that they'd had serious complaints from someone who'd bought Maid, checked it out for themselves, were extremely shocked and refused to stock it from then on (and I think destroyed existing copies), from a mixture of personal ethics and avoiding possible legal issues.<br/><br/>I just said OK, taken aback because I'd never heard that but obviously not wanting to belittle their experience.<br/><br/>So, just mentioned as a data point.

There's a big minefield around the game I translated.<br/><br/>I translated it because it's a fun game. That's pretty much it. Somehow I got Andy to come along for the ride, and somehow it worked out.<br/><br/>I can kinda see how people would find it offensive, but I'm too mired in otaku stuff to fully grasp that. Plus in actual play it's only creepy or overtly sexual when creepy or overtly sexual players go out of their way to make it that way. (There's these guys from Kentucky who keep signing up for my Gen Con games, but I don't wanna talk about it...)<br/><br/>As a book that you'd sit down and read it goes a bit outside of American cultural norms here and there, but I think the designer was trying to be a bit transgressive in the first place even in the context of the Japanese audience. (But ALL of his games are unabashedly about having fun.) And as Andy said, there's worse stuff being sold in the manga aisle at Borders (to say nothing of what you could find in Akihabara...)<br/><br/>Be as offended or creeped out as you want. The only thing I would ask is that you do so based on what Maid RPG actually is.<br/><br/><i>On a side note:</i> I don't know if it'll ever come to fruition, but I have an idea to do a collection of original material for Maid RPG. Along with all kinds of ludicrous randomness (like a new item table with items like Friendship Cube and Diabolic Hat), I wanted to do some research and put together some essays on real-life maids and other domestic servants, though on reflection it occurs to me that it wouldn't be terribly relevant to the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251874/#Comment_251874" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T13:45:35+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  1:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2010 1:47PM by Daniel H..">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Tony turned up the juice with some PvP stuff to make the game interesting, but he totally didn't step over the common ground of the game: Stabbing the master, nuking the mansion, tearing the system down, and so on.

He was expecting Maid to be one thing, it turned out to be another, and he kinda flipped out. I totally understand there, it's part of the discussion re adding a "for mature audiences" label, which we're looking into now.<br/><br/>The disturbing thing wasn't that, IMO: The disturbing bit was that, on a hunch, I glanced through their catalog: They carried the entire White Wolf collection in-store, including all the Vampire The Requiem titles I have on my shelf. No fewer than three books feature full female nudity: Women looking either brutal or brutalized, covered in blood and screaming.<br/><br/>It made me muse that if I replaced all the art in Maid with rough-brushstroke ("aaahrt"-looking art) of completely naked women, screaming and covered in blood, that they would have left it stocked.<br/><br/>They stocked books of art featuring full frontal female nudity in poses of extreme violence and pain, but not a game that mentions a few adult goods. IMO, that was more a statement of that store employee than the game. But again, meeting expectations with a "T+" self-imposed rating or "For Mature Audiences" label could have avoided that episode.

It's a gender-neutral term; it doesn't have the BDSM connotations that "master" might have for some; and it also goes further to imply (IMHO) that he or she isn't powerful and "masterly," which is what the game is about from what you and others have said (i.e. the maids are super-bodyguards and problem-solvers, so to speak).<br/><br/>And, on the rating thing, I can only say: welcome to America. Vibrator = at least an "R" rating, in the good ol', repressed U.S. of A. But have a care: that M rating you're considering could well disappoint just as much. Then again, a T rating makes no mention whatsoever of sexuality ("suggestive themes" might count, though?).<br/><br/>Huh... after checking ESRB, your T+ rating should have been fine--T is 13, the plus should imply a bit further (split the diff between T and M at 15?), and I suspect most folks know what a vibrator is at 15.<br/><br/>Or maybe one (reported) incident is not enough to sweat. or maybe erring on the "high side" is best, and slap an M rating on it, with a brief back-cover blur-box. Hehe... at least the folks who think it doesn't go far enough to deserve the M rating have to go in to complain about not ENOUGH sexiness--not likely to be as vocal as the Moral majority would be on the subject, I reckon.

Where the Master is not so very masterly in the game text it works well to inject a bit of absurdity into the proceedings. Also, "Master" is the usual translation for <i>goshujinsama</i> (assuming that's the word used in the original text) in the genre, so changing it would look pretty odd. It's also, of course, more kinky, which is a positive thing for a genre that's stylistically pretty much predicated on the embarrassment and buzz associated with its strongly genderized imagery. It doesn't take much exposure to figure out that the maid genre derives much of its basic character dynamics, skits and plotlines from sexual tension, just like any soap opera; no getting around that, and trying to cover it up by switching around the terminology or art and so on would just get confusing, selling the game short - I for one wouldn't have any idea of where the game is coming from if you sold it as a "household management game wherein housekeeping professionals go on missions to take care of chores assigned by the housekeeper". That superficial description is so orthogonal to the slapstick comedy central to the genre that if you remove all the genre markers, it becomes impossible to intuit what the game is supposed to be about. Then you're just left with a mass of zany random charts without a genre to guide you in interpreting them. More seriously, you won't know how a Master is supposed to act in this genre or how maids usually react to different situations, which can then take the game to some rather dark places too easily, just like Andy described earlier.<br/><br/>As for ESRB ratings, I understand that you can't apply those yourself - you need to submit the (video) game for review. But perhaps there's a convention for using sort of similar rating labels in similar media of your own initiative? I seem to remember reading that the movie-equivalent authority in the US has sued people over unauthorized use of the movie age labels in the past, though.

If the use of the word "Master" is going to turn you off of Maid RPG, it really isn't the game for you. One of these days I need to work more on the semi-generic version of the rules ("M.A.I.D. Engine") that I started on a while back.<br/><br/>The ESRB is a specific organization that has all kinds of copyrights and trademarks on its ratings and such. Even getting a rating on a video game costs $800 or $4000 (depending on your total development costs). I know American manga publishers seem to have voluntarily put together a set of <a href="http://manga.about.com/od/readingcollectingmanga/a/ageratings.htm" rel="nofollow">age ratings</a> (whereas in Japan AFAICT there's 18\u7981\u6b62 stuff for adults, and there's everything else).

In fact, I found it pretty well-done. The basic premise of the show is that an alien refugee craft comes to earth from a destroyed star civilization. The ship is basically manned (womanned, rather) by members of a special servitor species, like the female lead in the above illustration. Aside from possessing all sorts of magic-like high-tech capabilities these people are notable in that their purpose in life is pretty much to serve their respectively chosen masters in all ways.<br><br>The story begins with a lost member of the alien race getting stranded in a Japanese suburb, where a lone student (the male lead) picks her up out of the goodness of his heart, little suspecting that he's getting mixed up with aliens and a housemate who thinks of him as her one and only master. All sorts of slightly naughty comedy commences as the aliens try to retrieve the amnesiac "faulty specimen" while the protagonist learns to live with a willing slave.<br/><br/>OK, so pretty standard wank material so far. However, complications:\n<ul>\n<li>The aliens recognize that Earth is predominantly liberal, and the people who've welcomed them graciously on their planet would be afraid and disgusted if their true nature as a slave race were to become apparent. For this reason they've decided to hide their inclinations and designed purpose - they pretend to be independent as a stop-gap measure while trying to figure out a way to fit into the society of Earth.</li>\n<li>The male lead character is an average liberal, prudish sort you'd expect of a nice Japanese young man. The main dramatic tension in the show comes from the fact that he can't accept the servile nature of his alien slave - dares not, out of uncertainty and unfamiliarity with her condition and what it means for these aliens to be a slave. Lots of the interaction in the show is basically based on the alien slave offering her servitude in many ways ranging from comedic to tragic, and the male lead declining in horror at the idea of slavery. Towards the end of the show the protagonist ultimately reconciles his conflicting emotions by falling in love with his slave, which seems to make the situation acceptable to him.</li>\n</ul>\nIt's not something I'd use as a guidebook to gender relations by any means, but it's a nice what-if story about how a purpose-build slave caste might change a future society emotionally. I've read similar from golden age scifi authors, they just were less graphical due to a different medium. The tone is mostly comedic and melodramatic, not really serious - in fact, pretty similar to the Maid rpg, they're in essentially the same genre. Perhaps not to be recommended to anybody unable to distinguish between fiction and reality, of course - you'll just need to mix up these provocative Japanese fantasy dolls with real women to cross over the line into the darkest conservative fears. But then, that seems to be the case with almost any art at all, it makes a rotten guide to life when applied directly and without reflection.<br/><br/>I guess I'll take a little break and defend the Gor series next, or something.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251995/#Comment_251995" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T06:42:05+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  6:42AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that pic creepy?

The comedy came from the fact that she was this incredibly dangerous, powerful being, who cleaned the apartment of a young, school-age boy whose parents rented him an apartment while he went to school. There were a lot of gags involving her responding to problems with way more force than was necessary, and it was subverting the idea of the maid as the servile party since she was capable of singlehandedly destroying starships, and she worked for a shy teenager who wasn't entirely comfortable with having a maid in the first place. There was some unrequited sexual tension where he would become extremely uncomfortable with his attraction to her and she would be totally unaware of anything related to romance whatsoever.<br/><br/>So that anime and a couple others like it (I can't recall the names since I didn't watch them for very long) are my context, where being a maid is part of a joke of subversion and it seems like Maid does that. The Maids have special abilities, and there's all sorts of things in the random tables like if I remember right the Maid Outfit Random Table has Power Armor in it. Basically there's a lot of different ways you could play with the whole Master/Maid relationships with different types of Masters.<br/><br/>Also, if I remember right, aren't Maids the only ones who get special abilities?

That seems to me to be the entire premise of the series - how people handle such a problematic situation. It's nothing I wouldn't throw out as a bang in certain sorts of roleplaying games... in fact, that's a shock for <i>Shock:</i>, isn't it? "There are genetically engineered variant human beings used as slaves" seems text-book to me. Heck, <i>Blade Runner</i> uses that. This particular anime is just more straightforward about the primal psychology, namely the supposed male desire to advocate for a social model that allows them sex slaves. Blade Runner might not be that explicit about it, but the impact on human relationships (and human sex) is the thing that is really the crux issue of that particular shock, isn't it?<br/><br/>The point being, I find it positive and interesting if an artistic work is problematic and powerful in presenting its theme - I well might disagree with the conclusions, but that doesn't make the work bad as art.<br/><br/>Now, in case somebody who's actually seen the show wanted to tell me that it's disturbingly... positive and affirming towards the set-up, I'd have to agree with them. I would probably add that <i>Dears</i> clearly presents its image of powerful, physically hyper-perfect superhero love slaves from the stars as a glamorous fantasy replacement for real human relations. If I had to get all media-analytic and try to divine whether the authors of the work themselves supported and idolized female slavery, I wouldn't have any ready replies. This particular work <i>could</i> be a very stylish ironic statement, or it could be made by horrible, civilized but degenerate reprobates who wanted to advertise the idea that women are happiest in chains (or perhaps the idea that we should do some genetic engineering to make ourselves some improved women). I don't know, I can only speak of the work itself, not the motivations behind it. Whatever the intent (and if we're being frank - this is mainstream commercial anime, the real motivation is always that it sells, nothing more), the work itself is thought-provoking regarding gender-relations, the socially acceptable forms of love and the lines between liberal and fascist forms of society.<br/><br/>Actually, here's the anime's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6cf7XawG8Y" rel="nofollow">opening sequence</a> from Youtube. I think it's pretty frank about the topic and style of the series. As you can see, the series has a high sexual tension to it and a clear authoritarian theming - the name of the title song is "Love Slave" and the lyrics are pretty explicit, if you had any doubts about the topic. Still, the work is not psychologically simplified or instantly gratifying, it does really discuss its premise from a variety of angles.<br/><br/>Still, calling that "creepy" - maybe it is if you're unused to that sort of thing. I guess I would consider it creepy if somebody made it a hobby to collect and obsess over this particular subgenre of anime (female slavery is, indeed, an extreme subgenre of harem comedy), but considering the individual show on its own merits instead of painting an imaginary picture of what goes on in the heads of the fans... it's an intentionally provocative and extreme image of gender relationships in a fantastic scifi setting, I'm not going to get any more bend about it than about the latest Hollywood blockbuster or something. All sorts of things are done in art, and God bless the variety, especially when it's done in a fresh and intelligent manner. If our convictions about human equality and mutually respectful romance as the basis of carnal relationships can't stand some speculative fiction, then I should really be worried for our civilization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252014/#Comment_252014" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T08:37:41+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  8:37AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen the series you mention, Bret, I just don't remember the name off-hand...

There were some skits that I'd describe as "suggestive" or "naughty", the same sort of stuff you see in American teen comedies - people catching others in the act of disrobing for a bath, that sort of thing. All in all it's a considerably more chaste series than <i>Dears</i> discussed above, which is not surprising, as Dears is considerably newer and it builds upon the themes and conventions that have developed for the genre both in mainstream and erotic sections (this is obviously one of those genres where naughty and just suggestive cross-fertilize rather heavily).<br/><br/>Actually, I thought of a good comparison just now - Americans have a fetish about cheerleaders, yes?

(Your friend's PC is immune to pain so that she doesn't take damage from combat, while yours is <i>really good at doing laundry</i>. Game balance? Sorry, ne'er heard of that.) And that whole bit about house elves depending on their master for proper clothing kind of, sort of, fits in as well, in that points of Favour can also be used to purchase new outfits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252110/#Comment_252110" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T13:52:07+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  1:52PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2010 1:59PM by walkerp.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite><br>I am going to read some manga, read the game text itself, talk to some folks who know more about manga/anime culture than I do and either come back to this thread or start another one.

Neko's podcast is a good place to start, if you aren't listening to it already.  He and Andy talk about the general Japanese RPG scene in two episodes, which is very interesting, though only tangentially hits upon issues in this thread.  The one that really opened my eyes, though, was where he and Jake Richmond designer of Panty Explosion  <a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/yaruki-zero-podcast-11-rpgs-for-anime-fans/" rel="nofollow">talk about the enthusiasm </a>they received when bringing their games to an anime convention.  What was so informative about this discussion was how it made me realize that the anime scene is big (perhaps relatively as big if not bigger than D&amp;D was back in its heyday, and way more evenly gendered) and a thing unto itself.  So our reactions here to potentially controversial (to us) subjects like some of the sexuality in Maid would be seen as bizarrely overblown and the perspective of total outsiders who don't "get it."  Basically, they are more than okay with that stuff and there are a lot of them and they are mostly fairly normal people.  So we are the minority weirdos in this situation.<br><br/>Lots of more interesting data and speculation on this subject in this thread here:<br/><a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=813" rel="nofollow">http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=813</a> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252115/#Comment_252115" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T14:24:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  2:24PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I've seen the series you mention, Bret, I just don't remember the name off-hand... Mecha-Maid something something, perhaps? Didn't somebody mention it already upthread? It's a good example of what Maid shoots at in terms of content, I think. Definitely a fair comparison. There were some skits that I'd describe as "suggestive" or "naughty", the same sort of stuff you see in American teen comedies - people catching others in the act of disrobing for a bath, that sort of thing. All in all it's a considerably more chaste series than<i>Dears</i>discussed above, which is not surprising, as Dears is considerably newer and it builds upon the themes and conventions that have developed for the genre both in mainstream and erotic sections (this is obviously one of those genres where naughty and just suggestive cross-fertilize rather heavily).<br/><br/>Actually, I thought of a good comparison just now - Americans have a fetish about cheerleaders, yes? There is even a sort of high school genre where cheerleaders usually make an appearance? Would a game about cheerleaders - or just a game about high school comedy - be similarly creepy, what do you think?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahoromatic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahoromatic</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252125/#Comment_252125" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T15:06:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  3:06PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2010 3:12PM by Brand_Robins.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Basically, they are more than okay with that stuff and there are a lot of them and they are mostly fairly normal people.

I just opened MARS:Savage Worlds Edition from the RPGNow bundle.  Almost every single piece of art in that game (that shows humans) depicts the man as a fierce fighter and/or the woman as a sexual object, usually wearing a tiny bikini or even topless (frex page 18) or naked (frex page 72), and usually posed sexually as well.  So sure, the whole maid fetish is inherently sexist, but so is pulp.  (I seem to remember big long discussions about pulp in that regard, but I'm not sure if that was on SG.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252195/#Comment_252195" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T08:19:10+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  8:19AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only creepy thing about Panty Explosion is the title - it is creepier than the whole of Maid combined, though, and thus makes up for the rest.

Rather, that sort of art is enjoyed ironically, as a matter of what-if speculation and in full cognizance of how it's not <i>really</i> so fun to be denied equality. To me it seems like the exact same thing we do when we play a fantasy adventure game and pretend for a moment that it's OK to kill subhumans and steal their treasures because they're "evil". I don't usually expect people I play D&amp;D with to also advocate racial purity politics in their everyday life.<br/><br/>Also - you didn't know about Space Rat, really? It's a very funny game, I rather recommend it.

I accept that your judgment differs from mine and others in interpreting the art and text, but by saying "go play it" - you're presuming that people haven't, which doesn't seem warranted.   For example, Eero edited the Finnish text for Maid, so not hearing anything else, I'd presume he knows it reasonably well.  I have played it three times, including once with the English translator Ewen, and I find it creepy.  I generally agree with Eero here: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I find that if I have to choose between considering Maid a perverse sex game or pretending that it doesn't really mean to be kinky, I'll have to go with the former as being closer to the truth. The fact that you can use the game for non-kinky purposes, and the fact that the game's text has no overt pornographic tones, do not together mean that Judd is unfair in characterizing the game as having erotic overtones. The same goes for the whole maid phenomenon, by the way - you'd need to be blind to the subtext to claim that it's not a sexual fetish, and you'd similarly need to be blind to claim that the Maid rpg doesn't gesture towards that same fetish with its contents. It's all well and good that actual play is not pornographic, but rather comedic and adventurous; that's what I'd expect of any product in the ecchi genre, and that's what I'd definitely expect of a roleplaying crew - it'd be pretty weird to gather the guys together for a shared session of overtly sexual maid fetish narration, frankly. But saying that the fetish is not a motive force behind the game's imagery and genre is just stupid.</blockquote>\nThat anime fans are more numerous than my subcultures doesn't particularly dissuade me from thinking that it isn't creepy.  I mean, fundamentalist Christians and creationists are probably more numerous than role-players, and probably BDSM hobbyists as well.  <br/><br/>I might accept some arguments for why the kinky aspects of the game aren't harmful, but I don't buy at all that the game doesn't have sexual fetish as a motive force.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252276/#Comment_252276" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-23T21:24:25+00:00" title="January 23, 2010  9:24PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I haven't created a Finnish edition of Maid - the game has not been translated into Finnish. The earlier comparative discussion of translations concerned a sidetrack about <i>My Life with Master</i>, a different game. Regarding Maid I'm just a guy who read it, nothing more.<br/><br/>Other than that I'm in accord with John, as I in fact directly state in the above quote he chose: I very much think that something like Maid definitely has a grounding in sexual fetish. It's the kinky tension that provides much of the comedy. I don't think Maid needs much of a moral defense in this matter, except perhaps to remind moralists that sexual tension as a backbone of a cultural genre might not be exactly as uncommon as they might think. From what I've seen of American everyday tv drama I can't imagine that this is a controversial claim - everything from daytime soaps to primetime drama constantly plays on gender identity and sexuality in different ways. So picking Maid out as a some sort of exception because the comedy in its genre is often predicated on things like sudden nakedness, men being lecherous and women being over-demure, that doesn't seem very fair to me. Most works in the genre (Maid rpg included) are outright tame when compared to the naughty type of infantile Hollywood comedy blockbuster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252293/#Comment_252293" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-24T00:08:25+00:00" title="January 24, 2010 12:08AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>For Panty Explosion he lamented that there were psychic powers for levitation and making heads explode, but nothing for making panties explode.</blockquote>\nwait...Panty Explosion doesn't have the titular <i>exploding panties</i>?!

After all, while the book's introduction already specifically states that the maids in question are fantasy creatures straight out of the otaku imagination rather than any domestic servants found in real life, all material related to romance or intimacy is strictly optional and originally not even published as part of the basic game. The players can choose to play the whole thing as "kinky" or "non-kinky", naturally enough, but the rules don't lean towards the former by default.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252872/#Comment_252872" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T12:15:14+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 12:15PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>So our reactions here to potentially controversial (to us) subjects like some of the sexuality in Maid would be seen as bizarrely overblown and the perspective of total outsiders who don't "get it."</blockquote>\nYes. This. My students (mostly young women between the age of 15 and 20, but also a few boys) love Maid.

I'd consider it a bit of a dry and forced interpretation to play the game without any kinky subtext at all, but that is definitely possible without having the bend the rules. I'd compare it to playing <i>Paranoia</i> without anybody dying on or off-screen ever - possible, but unlikely, and the comedic possibilities would be severely curtailed to be sure.<br/><br/>It seems to me that we could go back and forth on whether Maid favours the kinky a long time without ever noticing that we're just understanding the terms in different ways. For instance, when I say that the game definitely favours a sexual subtext, I mean nothing more than the fact that players are going to be affected by the basic fiction of the game. I'm thinking of a very basic level of fictional interaction here; so much as even mentioning that your character actually dresses in a skirt all but suffices here, with or without knowing glances among the group. I'm sure you'll agree that it's rather unlikely for adult people to play this game without making use of the subtext on some, however distanced, level. As I mentioned above I can imagine a level of play where all of this subtext is ignored, but it needs to be an exceptional situation - I could see achieving it by playing with a group of prepubescent kids, maybe; they might handle the game as a pure adventure game without deriving anything from the fetishistic situation. But with adults, the least I'd expect would be somebody playing their character as a demure and easily embarrassed, hesitant naif - which choice would amply suffice for my claim, considering how this particular archetype - like most others present in strongly genderized fiction - makes no sense whatsoever without an understanding of implied sexual tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252916/#Comment_252916" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T14:10:27+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  2:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah...

I certainly wouldn't call any sexual tension "kink" - but I have used the term "kink" for Maid because I feel that it is appropriate.  To whit: For me, sexual tension is distinct from fetish or kink.  Moreover, sexual tension and/or sexual explicitness isn't at all the same as being creepy.  <br/><br/>So, for example, Under My Skin is a game that I've played that was very much filled with sexual tension - but it was in no way creepy to me.  It was played by consenting adults about consenting adults in relationships.  <br/><br/>Maid, on the other hand, I felt was creepy.  I'm prepared to argue that, but I'd like first to establish that Maid has both sexual tension and kink.  If we can't agree on this, then I don't think that I can effectively talk about creepiness.  <br/><br/>Regardless of whether the master is male or female, I'd say that there is inherent kink in a maid - appearing like the Maid illustrations - seducing the Master for additional favor.  Seducing the master is an inherent part of the rules, and the illustrations are a part of the game.  This is different than sexual tension.  Two consenting adults out on a date have sexual tension, but there is nothing inherently kinky about it.  There's nothing inherently wrong with kink, but there are instances of kink that I find creepy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252923/#Comment_252923" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T14:41:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  2:41PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maid sure has both kink and sexual tension.

The book does a really good job of addressing this up front and giving tips on how to handle it within game. Kudos to Andy for that, as I believe that was added for the American audience.<br/><br/>Thing is, though I am talking about the game with my friends, I'm not talking about it with all of my friends. Some wouldn't get it, wouldn't be interested, or would find it "creepy." That is the nature of the game. And I do the same thing when I'm looking for players for D&amp;D 4E and Spirit of the Century and any other game. Not everything is for everyone. Doesn't make it bad.<br/><br/>I will say, in reference to something Judd posted earlier, my 8 yo son is starting to get the hang of reading, and Maid and Kult and some other books will be going on a higher shelf to keep them out of site and out of mind. Chances are he wouldn't get anything out of either of those books anyway, but I do it to keep Mom happy and for my own concience as a parent.<br/><br/>Final thoughts?

What I don't see... and before this gets out of hand I have only read the game, not played it... is the inherent kink, and therefore the creepiness of the game.<br/><br/>There's another point here I want to make. When I talk about sexual tension I do not mean sexual attraction or desire, but tension in the sense of heightened awareness of gender and sex. The way you would tense up just a tiny bit whenever you end up in mixed company. IMO Maid is full of this. In fact I'd say it derives a lot of its humour from this type of tension, especially when consciously played up for laughs by the players.<br/><br/>That's what it seems to come down to, I think. Humour based on sexual tension. And the bigger the gulf between the innocence of what the characters want, and the sexually charged surface of what is happening... the funnier it gets. Throw in a little random whackiness, and that's Maid. Or at least one kind of Maid game. One which, I would argue, doesn't really deserve the label "kink" or "creepy".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252976/#Comment_252976" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T17:26:00+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  5:26PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Maid, on the other hand, I felt was creepy.

The seduction rules are an optional form of "social combat", not part of the core resolution system, which is clarified right in the beginning of that entire section, complete with the caveat that "it might make a scenario fun, or it might make playing with friends kinda creepy." Furthermore, they apply to everyone equally: that is, seduced characters can gain Favour from their seducers <i>no matter who the people involved in the relationship are</i>, so that a successful seducer effectively becomes a Master to someone else, making the maids <i>less</i> dependent on their employer. But even then, seducing the actual Master explicitly can't be used to demand additional points of Favour beyond what anyone would earn otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the criteria for awarding Favour, the closest <i>non</i>-optional entry on the list would be "achieving a nice atmosphere with the master", which frankly could mean... anything. The final two entries do cover "getting physical with the master", but again, those are marked as an option for mature ("or perhaps very, very immature") groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253177/#Comment_253177" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T11:35:08+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 11:35AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played only one session of Maid and I thought it was light fun and not creepy to me.

I was just trying to figure what are the elements in Maid that tip the scale into creepyland. It seems I got it all wrong in my premises and most of you are fine with sexual tension as comedy and it's completely about manga maids (a genre I don't really know).<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is a RPG that would convey the type of humor Toriyama used in the DB video sequence, or when he depicts Master Roshi as a nose bleeding old perv, or stuff like in Dr Slump. It's about sexual tension but it's never pushing the envelope to the point where the story and the art become targeted to adults only. I'd say it manages to keep it quite innocent even with a metaphorical wink to social taboos.<br/> <br/>I'm trying to evaluate if Maid could be an anime/manga comedy, sexually aware but non erotic, RPG for me. If that means culling potentially creepy items from random tables that's fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253690/#Comment_253690" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T08:40:53+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  8:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've thought about this thread for a couple days, so please don't take this as a knee jerk reaction.<br/><br/>I've never played Maid, but I have seen some material from the genre from which it draws its inspiration.

I really don't know what to say. Seriously. <br/><br/><b>Sexual slavery</b>? That doesn't appear anywhere in the book. It is literally like saying "I've never played Beast Hunters, but I have seen some material from the genre which it draws its inspiration..." and tie the game to Rape and Destruction of Culture . In the movies and literature, it's often the cultured/higher tech cultures which invade the more primitive people (whom you play in Beast Hunters) (like, The Mission, Black Robe, etc), and when they do so they tear apart their culture, and often rape/bride kidnap the natives. Then come back and say "...I feel uncomfortable around Rape. Even if you cover it up with dramatic action and narration, rape isn't acceptable." (and then link to the Sexual Slavery wikipedia article, as a lot of the content there is common of primitive/higher tech cultures warring with each other).<br/><br/>And I'm like... "of course rape is not acceptable, <i><b>but there's none of that in the game book...</b></i>".<br/><br/>Where are people getting these ideas from? Is there some play report out there where some hardcore macho Narrativist ran a "group therapy rape session" using Maid as the medium, and I just haven't seen it yet? Or are people just making assumptions?<br/><br/>I mean, seriously: I spent the last 10 minutes reading the Sexual Slavery article from top to bottom, especially focusing on the Comtemporary Sexual Slavery... and again, I'm baffled that people are thinking this stuff happens in Maid (either in the book, which it doesn't; or even in actual play, which I've never seen, not even in the depths of 4chan anonymous online irc RPs).<br/><br/>The last three cons (two game cons, one anime con) I visited, I brought copies of Maid to sell as I saw others were running sessions of it, and I wanted to offer folks a discount copy. Turns out that most of the folks at the table already had a copy, but it got me seeing and talking to the folks who play the game at home: Turns out to be normal gamers familiar with anime, doing normal "wacky comedy games", all without jumping into Rape, Human Trafficing, Prostitution, Murder, Suicide, and so on. Interestingly enough, I've seen a much higher women-to-men ratio playing Maid than any other game I've seen at cons like MACE or AnimeUSA (save for a Buffy RPG session at MACE, which was just one guy).<br/><br/>The best example I can think of is the "Girrl Gaming Group" of 4 women in their late 20s/early 30s who came up to me at AnimeUSA*, gushing that they love Maid, play it all the time as a "cool down session" between other sessions/campaigns and the like (a palate cleanser between Vampire campaign arcs)... They told me about their Maid antics and exploits, all of which could have been broadcast as a US Sunday Morning cartoon. I mean, should I say, "Oh, by the way, here's some guys who think that you're at best deluded, or at worst absolute sexual degenerates. Please pop over at some point and tell us why you are titlated by playing lightly dressed up rape fantasies with each other."<br/><br/>Is it just that people are continuing to read into something that isn't there? Or am I really missing something here?<br/><br/>*(2 of them ended up playing in my session with TonyLB, and one of them was asking our advice as a new/novice GM of how to run better WoD and anime-style games).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253745/#Comment_253745" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T10:35:19+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 10:35AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>However, the link between the game and the subject material that inspires it is too difficult for me to ignore.</blockquote>\nReally?

If that means culling potentially creepy items from random tables that's fine.</blockquote>\nI think this is a serious point of miscommunication.  <br><br>For me (and I think other), "creepy" is not the same as "erotic" or "sexual."  A little boy who is curious about what genitals are is not at all creepy.  Heck, people having sex isn't inherently creepy - though it may be erotic.  The creepiness in this case comes from the power dynamic.  <br><br>However, I think there is a serious difference in views on the subject.  If I heard from a friend about someone who has a house full of live-in maids, I wouldn't think "fun" or "neat" - I would think, "Creepy!"  Even moreso, if I heard that a maid had seduced her boss for more pay or job privileges, I would think "Creepy!"  The parallel, to my mind, is far far closer than Power Kill's parallel of D&amp;D to the real world - and I think that Power Kill is a legitimate take on the genre.  <br><br>To Andy's "Girrl Gaming Group" - I wouldn't call them deluded or sexual degenerates at all, any more than I would call D&amp;D players murderous thugs.  Being a fan of creepy fiction doesn't mean that one is delusional.  Similarly, I know of a number of people who are great fans of H.P. Lovecraft and R.E. Howard who vigorously deny that there is any racism in their stories.  I think they're wrong, and I think there's a problem with the works that they like, but that's not the same as saying that they are delusional, hateful racists.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253763/#Comment_253763" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T11:04:28+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 11:04AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>I didn't mean the cited recommended reading as much as I did the entire maid genre.</blockquote>\nAhhhh, ok. That makes sense.<br><br>To relate another bit:<br><br>Dictionary of Mu is my favorite pulp-themed RPG supplement, ever. Even more than Sorcerer and Sword. <br><br>Unfortunately, I stupidly watched the Daniel Pearl beheading video and some serbian soldier being beheaded in the woods with some other soldier's foot on his head (the former I clicked myself, the latter I watched by accident; casualty of the internet and all that). I don't recommend it unless you want to be pissed off at humanity.<br/><br/>Anyway, Mu features (amongst full frontal nudity, but whatever) pictures of a child braining someone with a big rock, a king with a sword and severed heads all around him.  <br/><br/>I don't consider those pieces to be "what the game is about". Personally, they squick me out, and I flip past them quickly in the book because torture/beheadings is just one of my Buttons. But I never really mention it to others: It's my own baggage I bring to the genre.

Picking a completely arbitrary example that to my knowledge sticks pretty close to the average of naughtiness in the Hollywood genre of naughty comedy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pie_2" rel="nofollow">American Pie 2</a>, a movie that is certainly more grotesque than the text of <i>Maid</i>, grossed something like 300 million dollars according to Wikipedia.<br/><br/>Now, keeping the above in mind, the way I see it, we only have a few logical conclusions here:\n<ul>\n<li>Somebody who considers Maid nasty would be similarly offended by my completely arbitrary pick of an American naughty comedy blockbuster. Fine, that is your pregorative. However, why should I not consider your opinion that of a prude, exactly? Most of the civilized world at this date has no problems with naughty comedy, so aren't you and your minority opinion prudish by definition? Why is this not the case if you insist on condemning what is essentially the core of mainstream cultural mores at this point? Note that I have nothing against American Evangelical fundamentalism, to pick an ideology that would indeed stand in judgment of <i>American Pie</i> - but if something marginal like that is going on here, how are we to understand and appreciate each other's opinions if we don't discuss the ideological underpinnings frankly?</li>\n<li>Ye who complain of Maid perhaps did this in the mistaken impression that the game involves something more sordid than your perfectly average naughty American comedy. I might be tempted to cite this as the result of ignorance or some sort of special pleading for American culture - it's somehow more acceptable for an American to joke about masturbation or peeking under women's skirts than it is for a Japanese, I don't know. Why should I not try to educate and correct your view, if it is indeed predicated on you simply not knowing enough about the topic to have an informed opinion? Many people in this thread have engaged the topic based solely on the game's website. I don't dismiss these opinions off-hand myself as you can still have an opinion on the genre and the website even without reading the game, but it always seems that people go from looking at the website into wild flights of fancy concerning the contents of the actual game text. Take that sexual slavery thing for instance; the only way Maid is involved in sexual slavery is the same way <i>Wonder Woman</i> comics with their busty damsel in distress theme are. Even if you don't care about the topic enough to look at the actual game, it'd be nice if you at least limited your critique to the material you actually have some knowledge about.</li>\n<li>This, I think, is likely the most likely reason here: a person arguing that <i>Maid</i> is offensive on a rpg board is very likely doing this because he feels that rpgs should be held to different criteria than movies, comics, novels or primetime television. I'm not trying to put words into anybody's mouth, this is just what this whole discussion seems like: you people must be aware that getting offended about naughty comedy in the media is something that was hip over fifty years ago, you can't be unaware that this sort of comedy happens in the television every single day. But in roleplaying, those discussions we actually have relatively often: gamers have a high degree of ownership feelings for the media of roleplaying, they would like it to accord with their own tastes and preferences. We all are likely much more provincial about roleplaying as a media than we are about television, simply because we feel more attached to it. But stop to think about it, is it really a valid argument for condemnation that roleplaying should be kept more pure and more in accordance with my personal preferences than any other media? Is it just because roleplaying is small and my word should thus have more weight? Is it because I like it more than television or movies? Is it because I think that I'll have more support for my prudish (relatively speaking, no offense intended) opinions with the demographic that enjoys roleplaying? Am I worried that I will get stamped with the pervert badge in my own, prudish non-gamer community? Am I still hanging onto some Satanism scare that happened 20 years ago? Thinking about it, is any of the above justifications really valid for requiring roleplaying to follow a different set of rules than other media does?</li>\n<li>The last reason I can think of is that a person might accept <i>American Pie</i> but not <i>Maid</i> specifically because the naughtiness in <i>American Pie</i> was of acceptable kink, while that in Maid was a bad sort of kinky fetish, something that is to be judged evil, no matter how implicit the reference. I <i>personally</i> don't see Maid as any closer to the BDSM scene than superhero comics are - both involve sexually suggestive character types in fetish uniforms, but doing very non-explicit things that don't really have anything directly to do with sexuality, alternative or otherwise. However, if you happen to think that BDSM or similar sexual fetishes are bad <i>and</i> implicit references like Maid anime or superhero comics are also bad, then I fully support the notion that you should judge the Maid rpg as well. To me this is another reductio ad absurdum, I find it absurd that somebody would judge maid anime, superheroes and sexual roleplaying as so harmful that anything, however tenuously associated, should be ostracized. There have been stages like that in western history, though, so perhaps it is possible.</li></ul>\nTry as I might, I can't off-hand think up any other explanations for the absurd double standard I'm seeing in the above than ignorance, prudishness or holding rpgs to a different standard. It's not a double standard if you really think that naughty comedy is bad and creepy - but it is prudish, I don't really see a way around saying that when the mainstream society so clearly accepts this stuff as part of the media landscape. Likewise, although I'm not a fan of ignorance, considering rpgs somehow sacred and special is a valid opinion, even if it is clearly something that needs to be discussed separately before I can really understand or approve of any attacks on something like <i>Maid</i>. For instance, if anybody convinced me that roleplaying is for kids and I'm a pervert for still playing them at my advanced age, then I'd probably agree that something like Maid would be suspect, as its very medium would clearly label it as intended for children. You'll note that this is the same argument that Comics Code had when it was instituted in the USA - perhaps somebody still supports that particular move, I don't know.<br/><br/>Is there some other explanation for the phenomenon I'm seeing here than the ones I list above? If there is, I'd be interested in hearing about it and the world-view behind it, because I truly am stumped as to why we're complaining about <i>Maid</i> here and not about Conan O'Brian, who surely made some joke about pedophiles, cheerleaders, lecherous billionaires or something like that this last week. (This is not really directed at Judd - the way I understand it, he's getting to know the game text and will weight in with an informed opinion if and when he feels like it. Our earlier altercation is rather void, considering that he hadn't really looked into the work itself or the cultural context surrounding it - I was really just bashing him for not knowing what he's talking about, which I'm sorry for.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253828/#Comment_253828" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T13:19:29+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  1:19PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            merb101 wrote: <i>Also, I plan on posting a discussion on how to use Maid to emulate the super hero genre, albiet in a very anime fashion, in the next day or two.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWell, one obvious possibility that comes to mind is putting the general public into the position of the Master, instead of having any single NPC in charge, and defining the city where the hero(in)es fight crime as a Mansion.

The way I see it, I'd play the game with nubile cosplayers than socially-suspect beardguts if I wanted to work on the social atmosphere. It's not entirely intuitive why we should project a certain sort of social situation (socially dysfunctional and misogynic fat nerds acting out their sexual frustration) on a roleplaying game that is obviously not created for that social situation. If that's all that roleplaying can be as a medium, then sure - but my friends are sure going to be disappointed when I tell them that they're too polite, mannered, clean, thin and girl to play roleplaying games anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253845/#Comment_253845" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:01:27+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:01PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2010 2:02PM by walkerp.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/><br/>Is there some other explanation for the phenomenon I'm seeing here than the ones I list above?

However, there is one factor that you did not include in your lengthy analysis and that is the under-age issue.  While clearly youthful femininity and youth in general is highly sexualized in our society, we still draw draw a very firm (rhetorical and artistic) line between women and girls.  I know the loudest fascists in our community use the underage issue as the touchstone for their rage against Maid and I'm sure many other more moderate people still find that element makes them uncomfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253846/#Comment_253846" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:01:54+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:01PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly I think we're projecting the potential for embarrassment and discomfort onto the experience.<br/><br/>True story, possibly relevant: So I was playing InSpectres with my circle of guys for the first time, and they were feeling their way around the confessionals mechanic. They did, you know, kind of standard confessionals initially -- "good thing I brought a can of hairspray and a lighter so I could scare off the monster" type personal empowerment stuff.<br/><br/>At some point, I introduce some NPC with the very, very strong suggestion that she was a dominatrix. I think she showed up at the door to her apartment in leather bustier and thigh-highs. I mean like totally silly. In the course of play we/they figure out she's ... oh I don't know. A witch or something. Someone important. And one of the players decides he's going to get clever with his confessional: "If Bobby hadn't gotten himself seduced by Madame Leticia, we would never have been able to talk our way into her apartment."<br/><br/>The "Bobby" character was played by my little brother. <br/><br/>Oh, the players had such a hoot. Me playing the dominatrix, my little brother playing the seducee. Massive amounts of discomfort was obvious in my little brother, but man he <i>wanted that extra XP</i> (or whatever it is you get when you validate someone's confessional). And the discomfort was hilarious to the player who had engineered the scene, and everyone else.<br/><br/>The interesting bit to me was that the engineering player assumed a big piece of the hilarity was the dynamic between my little brother and I. But from my perspective, as GM, I had no individual investment in the scene. I was just playing the dominatrix like I'd play any other character in the game -- the racist cop, the computer nerd with the head cold, the slobbering demon from beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Anyway, lots of thoughts in that story. It's been bouncing around inside my head ever since this thread started. I'm not sure I'd feel creepy GMing the "Master" character because I would not be invested in being serviced/adored by the maid-players. As an informed player, rationally I would understand that this was all being done with a wink and a ton of irony. As an uninformed player, I could totally see where there might be some expectation of an embarrassing social dynamic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253852/#Comment_253852" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:15:37+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:15PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, being creeped out is a highly subjective thing.  Sometimes, the thing that creeps someone out is not necessarily apparent, and often times it can be unspoken or implicit.  For example, there is nothing legally wrong with dressing up 4 year olds beauty pageants, but it is very creepy to a lot of people.<br/><br/>Before this thread, when I saw the cover of Maid, my mind immediately thought of shows like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Is_My_Master" rel="nofollow">He Is My Master</a>.  Even though, I now am more knowledgeable of Maid and aware that it is different than I expected, the author list He Is My Master as recommended viewing.  I find that show creepy, and below is one of the reasons why...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wikipedia (grain of salt required)</cite>Izumi is one of the three girls who get hired by Yoshitaka. While reluctant about working there she has to work for Yoshitaka as she has a huge debt to pay off. Because Yoshitaka is the way he is, Izumi repeatedly stamps on him and hands out pay to him. She is impossibly strong (shown in various episodes) and has rather large breasts for a 14 year old.<br/>...<br/>Everyone, including Mitsuki, messes with her in some sort of sexual tendency much to Izumi's dread. Be it flipping her skirt or attempting to remove her bra, Izumi is constantly being harassed.</blockquote>A girl is an indentured servant and forced to deal with sexual harassment.  While this kind of stuff is not explicit sexual slavery, I hope that you can see how this might remind me of sexual slavery and creep me out.  I know that not every show in the maid genre is like this, but it does seem to be a sexual fetish <i>with a side of servility</i>, which creeps me out.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253854/#Comment_253854" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:30:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I can tell, Phil is saying "this creeps me out and I should not play it," not "this creeps me out and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> should not play it." Some of the comparisons he makes to sexual slavery <i>imply</i> that there's a moral judgment happening here, but I'm not sure there is. Phil, can you clarify?<br/><br/>Me? Maid doesn't interest me at all (mostly as a genre thing) but it doesn't really creep me out. It's a game. It's pretend behavior. No one is actually hurting anyone. I do not believe that more young girls are being exploited because people play the Maid RPG. Hell, maybe <i>fewer</i> young girls are being exploited because there's an RPG for people to play out sexual power fantasies, in their heads, instead of with people who can't give informed consent. Yay.<br/><br/>Also, realize, most people who play Maid won't play the creepy master character, right? They'll be the maids, the "victims" of the master, but they'll also probably get revenge and stuff. I compared Maid to My Life with Master at the top of the thread. If Maid creeps you out, does MLwM, too? MLwM explicitly sets up a very abusive power relationship, exploits it, and makes the abused characters <i>repeatedly break the law, even torture and kill</i> -- they often have no choice.

Part of the game is the need to push the boundaries of comfort for the characters, which sometimes means pushing the players, too, a little bit. It's not creepy at all from the GM's viewpoint, who is just playing the method of the game in a rather objective and distanced manner, but I sure think that those Master characters have been hella creepy within the fiction itself - and if somebody thought that the creepiness of the Master was because I was being creepy as the GM, then I can see how they'd find what I was doing horrifying. But this sort of thing is really OK, because that's the sort of game MLwM is - it's a horror game, part of playing it is definitely supposed to be the slight discomfort and horrorful repulsion we feel when engaging with horror literature. Similarly with Maid, I should think that the game's not being played to its potential if there's not a slight, tense awareness of the genderized character identities interacting with each other. Might as well play a bunch of unisex-uniformed plumbers if that facet of the game is not being appreciated.<br/><br/>That's a good point, Olman - the age issue is definitely a valid one, just as much as the BDSM issue. I don't know how I again forgot it... actually, I do know. The age issue keeps slipping from my mind because to me it's just a part of the sexual fetish thing; real minors are not being molested in the game, it's just a twist on fiction between adults. I don't see it as fundamentally different to roleplay teenagers on the cusp of sexual awakening than to roleplay a maid-Master relationship. Both are relatively common sexual fetishes, both are handled in an indirect and largely symbolic manner by the maid genre and anime in general (much of anime is made for teenagers, you can believe that it involves minors trying to get a handle on their sexuality), so I guess the only reason to be leery of fantasies involving young girls in particular is if you want to draw a straight arrow from "let's pretend that we're young girls" to "let's molest some young girls". Maybe that sort of worry is justified - but if it is, it seems to me that it's predicated on very similar grounds as being worried that D&amp;D players become axe-wielding maniac murderers.<br/><br/>I don't say that there isn't room in <i>Maid</i> for glorifying some genuinely twisted sexual practices, but for that you really need to actively make all the right (or wrong, rather) choices in picking the setting, situation, characters, lines and veils, your own attitude, and so on and so forth. It's a very similar situation to if you played D&amp;D and had the king send the adventurers out to "pacify the countryside" by going from rebel village to rebel village and killing everything, non-combatants included, except when they need to capture one alive for torture. Everything in that scenario is present in D&amp;D in implicit form, but it's the players who need to make the choice to turn the game into a sadistic bloodfest in the first place, as that is certainly not the intent present in the game's text. Playing Maid with explicit sexuality instead of an implicit and comedic take is like playing D&amp;D and revelling in the violence and pain caused by the violent and greedy adventurers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253856/#Comment_253856" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:40:09+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:40PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen a couple of episodes of <i>He is My Master</i>.

Not any more than the average <i>Monty Python</i> movie, for instance; a rather typical Monty Python sketch is to take a thing people consider serious and then drag it through the mud to arrive to something like "Every Sperm is Sacred" in <i>The Meaning of Life</i>. Being offensive is part of the comedy, it challenges the audience to check their preconceptions and see the world in a new way.<br/><br/>I suppose I'd be annoyed with <i>He is My Master</i> if it took itself more seriously. <i>Dears</i>, discussed earlier, is a much more challenging work in that you can't really interpret it as a naughty farce - rather, the general thematic thrust of that work is clearly in strongly advocating, or at least presenting for consideration, a wholesale acceptance of BDSM relationships as normative in society and especially gender relations. A comedy piece that flouts propriety for the sake of notoriety is rather unproblematic in comparison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253858/#Comment_253858" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:45:21+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:45PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>As far as I can tell, Phil is saying "this creeps me out and I should not play it," not "this creeps me out and<span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>should not play it."

It feels to me like you are deliberately ignoring this and instead using your preconception of objectors being prudes.  <br/><br/>For example, I played Under My Skin at the last Knutepunkt, which was totally about sexuality, relationships, infidelity, and so forth.  There were a lot of funny bits and a lot of touchy bits.  There were things about it that were uncomfortable, but I would never use the word "creepy" to describe it.  <br/><br/>American Pie II has a lot of sexual situations.  However, here's the key thing again.  If I heard about some real teenager who accidently glued his hand to his penis while masturbating, I would think "Ouch!  The poor kid!"  However, again, if I heard about a real millionaire with a house full of live-in maids where one seduced him for special favor, I'd think "Ugh! Creepy!"  These both have sexual tension, but there are some pretty important differences.  I do not think that it is reasonable to lump these together as "Oh, these are both just examples of sexual tension."  <br/><br/>Along those lines, I don't think that it being just comedy or it being just a fetish negates any message it has.  Just because it's someone's personal kink doesn't mean that it is not creepy.  There is, for example, an awful lot of BDSM-related fetish that centers on rape situations.  There is various anime that plays to this theme as well as plenty of American material.  <br/><br/>There is also, in my opinion, plenty of comedy that is genuinely offensive.  Some people hold that comedy cannot be offensive because it is inherently just poking fun at its subject.  Thus you'll find various defenses of the Amos &amp; Andy Show on the web.  I don't happen to agree.  Simply being comedy doesn't mean that something is fine.  <br/><br/>Now, there are comedies that are about racism and/or sexism that deconstruct people's assumptions - poking fun at the prejudice rather than at the target.  However, just having sexist or racist stereotypes in a comedy doesn't automatically mean that it is doing this.  I can't just draw an equivalence between any comedy involving prejudice.  i.e. "Blazing Saddles is a comedy and The Amos &amp; Andy Show is a comedy too.  Anyone who likes one and disapproves of the other is a hypocrite."  That doesn't work, because there are some really important differences in the portrayals between the two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253904/#Comment_253904" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T23:08:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 11:08PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a chance to glance through Maid, and while I do find a few of the things in there to be creepy, for the most part the text is innocuous or just goofy.

If it's just that I'm calling it a prudish complaint - well, might be that I'm again missing some nuance of the English term, but how is it not prudish if you object to a sexual phenomenon on moral grounds? Might be that it's well-deserved condemnation, but surely prudence is relative to the prevailing community standards - and like it or not, <i>Maid</i> is generally accepted and acceptable within the anime community, which makes those objecting to its mores prudish in comparison. Or do I misunderstand the term that badly?<br/><br/>As for the actual point of whether <i>Maid</i> is somehow worse than <i>American Pie</i> or whatever, I suppose it's ultimately a nuanced matter of personal morality and media readership. As I already noted earlier, it is certainly a coherent argument to detach <i>specific</i> elements from the work and condemn them as immoral - as long as you're not using a double-standard and really are willing to condemn those sorts of messages in media in general and not just here because you don't like adult cartoons or whatever medium-related hang-ups various people might have with <i>Maid</i>. In this case it seems that you, John, are saying that you find portrayals of uneven gender relationships, especially in romance, such a touchy subject that it might even be an inappropriate subject for comedy. If I've understood the crux of the issue correctly, then I suppose there's not much to be said about that within the purview of this discussion - just that I disagree, but I do respect your opinion and agree with you that Maid does, indeed, deal with this sort of material. If somebody else is considering <i>Maid</i> but knows that they don't stand poking fun at domination fetishes, I'd be warning them against <i>Maid</i>, too.<br/><br/>Assuming that I didn't misunderstand John's argument up above, we might have a preliminary conclusion here - that <i>Maid</i> does, indeed, include plenty of comedy centered around authoritative roles in society, gender relationships and sexuality. As is the nature of roleplaying, sometimes those roles are affirmed, sometimes denied and sometimes simply poked full of holes with the poker of comedy. If this sort of thing seems offensive to you, I won't continue complaining about any misunderstandings; that is very much what Maid does, so I think that considering the game creepy on those grounds is well-deserved for anybody who thinks that authority relationships are a taboo. So that's the sort of complaint that is not based on not reading the work or misunderstanding its context or whatever, as far as I can see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253920/#Comment_253920" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T09:16:17+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  9:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>is it not prudish if you object to a sexual phenomenon on moral grounds?</blockquote>\nOnly if you're objecting on sexual moral grounds.

To me, prudishness is not implied just by any objection to a specific sexual phenomenon.  If someone, say, objected to pedophilic sex scenes (i.e. older adults with young teens or pre-teens) but not to other sex scenes - that is objecting to a sexual phenomenon on moral grounds, but it is not prudish.  <br/><br/>I feel like your warning misses the mark, though, Eero. If you asked me, for example, I <b>love</b> the idea of poking fun at domination fetishes - and I think it is a perfectly appropriate subject for comedy.  I might ramble for a bit about the Conan RPG one-shot game that I've run, called "Brawny Thews." (*)  It was over interest in something like this that I signed up for the Maid event at GenCon 2007.  However, I didn't feel that Maid as a game poked fun at domination fetishes, any more than Amos &amp; Andy poked fun at racist stereotypes.  Based on my reading and experience, the Maid RPG simply engages in the fetish stereotypes, rather than satirizing them.  It does make fun of men who lust after maids, but then, Amos &amp; Andy made fun of a few white people, too.  <br/><br/>Now, someone might use the Maid RPG to poke fun at such fetishes, but I don't think that's built into the game.  For example, I might be interested now in running a game of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Valet!</span> - which uses exactly all of the Maid rules, but has all male PCs instead of all female.  This isn't the only way to satirize the fetish, but it is one way to challenge stereotypes instead of engaging in them.  <br/><br/>* My Conan RPG game wasn't a comedy, but it did play on fetishes.  The PCs were a group of Cimmerian barbarians, all of sexy male archetypes.  They were captured and forced to fight in the arena.  Before they fought, though, the Hyrkanian Empress came to visit them.  I described how they were doused with water by guards, and then told to put on silk loinclothes and slippers for the visit.  In the first run particularly, one of the PCs refused to be dolled up that way and ripped off his own loincloth, and most of the others followed suit.  When the empress visited, then, she had a very amusing reaction.  I role-played the empress speaking to ones among them, during which my gaze would often drop below their faces and she would not pay attention to what they were saying.  This was amusing, but it was also fitting with the genre and sexy while still stretching the usual roles (i.e. a powerful woman and the male barbarians as sex objects).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253974/#Comment_253974" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T16:54:58+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  4:54PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a valid reading of <i>Maid</i>, I think, and an interesting issue because it seems to be so dependent on how one reads the corresponding anime genre. For instance, I suspect that were I to claim that <i>He is My Master</i> pokes fun at authority issues involved in the relationship between the maid and master, I'm not so sure that everybody would agree. I see casting a teenage boy uncertain of his power against a bunch of headstrong girls as a sort of sexual fantasy, yes, but not a particularly morbid sort - that sort of set-up, common to anime, mostly speaks of the otaku stereotype and how the genre finds gender relationships highly problematic when the male is a typical geek, uncertain of himself. I can't avoid reading something like this piece of comedy anime as not so much advocating for an inequal power relationship between the man and the woman, but rather as flippantly equalizing the relationship where, from a geek viewpoint, the woman already possesses all the power, so letting the man have all the money and power of employment in the scenario at least allows him some sort of concrete means of approaching the woman. It's not serious in this case, but there's plenty of serious drama anime that builds on similar premises, various scenarios that mostly work as excuses for the geeky male protagonist to get involved with the fairer sex on equal terms when he never could do it without the fantastic providence of the anime's scenario.<br/><br/>Am I completely off-base when sketching a reading like that for this sort of anime? I think this is important, as there's quite a bit of difference between accusing <i>He is My Master</i> of misogynist perversion and considering it a piece specifically created to speak to a marginal audience that is not interested in putting down women so much as fantasizing about treating with women on equal, safe terms. This also goes for Maid, and especially the context it's interpreted in: the vast majority of the maid genre is comedic, so when I say that <i>Maid</i> has ample support for poking fun at authority relationships, I mean this in the same sense as when we say that Maid is a light comedy game to begin with: there's nothing particularly light about the game unless you bring in an understanding of the genre it's based on, and likewise there's no making fun of authority relationships unless you choose to follow the conventions of the genre. For instance, if a player doesn't know how lightly the strong women typical of the genre flout the authority of the wimpy master-figure (especially at a hint of anything improper), it's no wonder if he finds himself playing the role orders of magnitude more submissive than it's intended. Or rather, "intended", as <i>Maid</i> is a pretty traditional rpg text in that it doesn't try to lock down the tone of the group's play nearly as much as some other game about the topic might. But looking at that list of recommended viewing, I'm not seeing anything in it that isn't mainstream tv in Japan - any offense towards fundamental human decency one chooses to read into either Maid or its background influences seems like it comes at the expense of judging a large swath of geeks whose greatest crime seems to be that they have lots of hang-ups about asking a girl out. Of course, perhaps that is the ultimate point here - if we conclude that the Japanese sure are pervy lil' buggers from an American viewpoint, surely that's not any great news?<br/><br/>Ultimately I guess the different readings of the game text are mostly inspired by different relationships to anime and the genre of harem comedy in specific. We probably could approach this discussion from the viewpoint of analyzing some maid anime like <i>He is My Master</i> to find that yes, the differences in reading are fundamental, and where one sees tones of sexual slavery another sees a harmless geek comedy poking fun at how geeks view and interact with women. I'm pretty confident in my reading (that's the one where we don't assume that harem comedy and romantic anime in general is popular because anime fans are all misogynic perverts) here, but I'd love to hear more about alternative viewpoints. For instance, Phil - do you really find that the subtext of <i>He is My Master</i> is in actual execution misogynic, or are you just working off the synopsis here? To my eyes Izumi is a pretty typical farce protagonist: it's just that instead of getting hit in the head by a plank wielded by Stan Laurel she gets people peeking under her skirt. No damage results, however, and the character certainly gives as good as she gets. Times change, but I think I'm pretty good in reading media, and what I'm seeing is farce, situation comedy and comedy of manners, not anything substantial enough to carry a dark misanthropic message of sexual slavery. The very worst I'd call this stuff out on is a regressive view on gender, but even that is a rather wimpy argument for somebody who believes in people sorting out their own lives in a free society; if anime with hyper-developed gender roles is the thing for folks, in comedy or full seriousness, then that's surely interesting, but ultimately not necessarily a sign of actually regressive cultural development. As I wrote earlier in the thread, most girls I know who are into anime like this exact sort of thing not because they pine for a strong man to control their lives, but because they find it funny or romantic or a multitude of other things - but never have I witnessed adverse results from people experiencing different ideas through art. As far as I'm concerned: make your art with as regressive gender roles as you want as long as you make it good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253979/#Comment_253979" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T18:22:04+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  6:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Phil - do you really find that the subtext of<i>He is My Master</i>is in actual execution misogynic, or are you just working off the synopsis here?</blockquote>Yes, I do think that there is something wrong with <i>He Is My Master</i>.

It feeds into the geek viewpoint that you noted.  If a guy could just have [X] power over the girl, then the relationship will work out just fine.  It's something espoused in <i>He Is My Master</i>.  Yoshitaka used his power to keep Izuma in the relationship long enough for her to come to the realization that if she would just make him her master forever, she would be happy.<br/><br/>And that is messed up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253982/#Comment_253982" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T19:08:18+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  7:08PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do agree that it's a rather weird theme! On that we are in complete agreement. This might be just a terminology issue, or (even more likely) an issue of how we approach art, culturally. I wouldn't call <i>He is My Master</i>, <i>Dears</i> or other otaku romance pieces creepy merely because I disagree with their themes, just like I don't call the Bible creepy even if my disagreement with it is of a much greater degree. It's all solid art made for messages contrary to my own world-view, but that just makes it interesting to me, not creepy or, heaven forbid, worthy of censure or careless comparisons to human rights crimes. Thought and crime are so distant, and art considering a thought is still farther away from actual immoral action.<br/><br/>But for the sake of discussion, we might consider this issue satisfied: <i>He is My Master</i> has a rather peculiarly Japanese otaku theme in how it views womanity, and it's not the only anime like that out there. Individuals will phrase their reactions to this sort of controversial art in different ways, as we've seen here. I don't begrudge this reaction, it is reasonable for people for whom the issues presented are close-to-heart. We've probably all met people who get offended at comedic critiques of religion or politics or national history, it's not that different to get a bug up your nose about gender roles and the messages television throws at us on that account. I might argue that the blatantness of the anti-feminist message in <i>He is My Master</i> is on par with a lot of what gets shown in American tv, but this of course depends on how and what you're used to seeing, and isn't that pertinent ultimately in considering the <i>Maid</i> rpg.<br/><br/>Still, all that said, I don't find the interesting and problematic thematic background of maid anime to be a problem for the <i>Maid</i> rpg - in fact, problematic and discussion-worthy issues like these are what routinely makes for good roleplaying. The game doesn't say that the player characters should ultimately accept their roles as weak females who need Masterful guidance in life; those sorts of thematic choices are left up to the play to resolve, just like they should. I return here to the idea that the game allows us to affirm, deny and develop the conclusions of harem comedy anime freely according to the inspiration of the group. Just like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is not immoral because the <i>Book of Mormon</i> is, the game of <i>Maid</i> is not at fault for presenting a provocative scenario the players are free to resolve to their satisfaction. Regressive gender relationship themes will only make their way into the game if the players decide to tell that particular story, which they might do for any number of reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254061/#Comment_254061" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T09:57:46+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  9:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I do agree that it's a rather weird theme!

I'm not saying that something like "He Is My Master" is not solid art, uninteresting, or that it should be banned from shelves.  On the other hand, I think it should be criticized and its messages highlighted by calling it what it is.  <br/><br/>From what I read, you seem to be saying here that no art should ever be called "creepy" or spoken harshly of at all.  I'm not sure if this was your intent - maybe you're mixing "censure" (to criticize harshly or express disapproval) with "censor" (to ban from being read)?  I think people can and should harshly criticize works of art, especially works whose message they disagree strongly with.  To me, open and honest criticism and discussion of art is just as important as the art itself.  <br/><br/>As for careless comparison to human rights crimes...  I don't think this should be careless - and I wouldn't draw an equivalence between doing something and artistically portraying something.  However, artistic works can have enormous power for harm or good - especially in mass.  While it might not be right, I think fiction often has more impact on public opinion than documentaries or even news programs.  For example, Klu Klux Klan membership rose enormously following the release of Birth of A Nation in 1915.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254068/#Comment_254068" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T10:45:45+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 10:45AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are in agreement on how to approach art, John. Honest and open are the key words there, though - vague accusations of creepiness and unsuitability to children are, I think, what inspires objections in cases like <i>Maid</i>. I for one would disagree only on the most academic level to a clearly reasoned critique of the game on the basis of harmful depiction of gender roles (or whatever a given critic might consider the problem with the game). Saying that the work is creepy (a subjective view) invites explanations, and claiming that it is morally degenerate invites critical defense.<br/><br/>I guess the difference between censure and critique is mostly in the tone and seriousness of the treatise. A proper critic of art invites others to familiarize themselves with the work and follow the logic presented to its conclusions, while an ostracizing censure strives to turn public opinion against a work or its ideas without substantially engaging with them. This thread is a pretty good example, as we've progressed in many ways from ostracism to critique here: while I object to uninformed conclusions and scare tactics directed at denigrating a work sight unseen, I have nothing but excited acceptance for anybody who wants to take a critical look at something like maid anime and share his conclusions with others. I might not agree with the conclusions, but insight is never unwelcome.<br/><br/>Even as we're in agreement about maid anime being seeped in sexist themes, perhaps some small disagreement remains about the role of the <i>Maid</i> rpg in enforcing this thematic. What do you think, John - am I being unfair if I characterize the game as involving the genre and its premise, but leaving the players to make their own judgment of the nuances of gender relationships? Just like there is maid anime that undermines the sexist paradigm in many ways, the game of <i>Maid</i> can likewise be played in many different ways, right? The comedic premise of the work might make it difficult for an outside observer to know at times whether something is presented sincerely, in ridicule or perhaps slyly in the cloak of comedy - but even then it should be obvious to the audience and creators of the work, in this case gamers. We surely know our own opinions on female subservience, and are thus quite able to play <i>Maid</i> accordingly.<br/><br/>Furthermore, on account of the moral wrongness of sexist comedy in general... I don't know if this makes me really insensitive to the blight of oppressed women everywhere, but I have to say that I enjoy the fact that all viewpoints towards even such domestic matters as gender relationships have the chance to get heard in our society. Even if I might disagree with the sexist conclusions Phil draws from <i>He is My Master</i> and the ones I concluded from <i>Dears</i> upthread, the fact that these matters are played with in art and entertainment can't but aid us as individuals and society in weighting our values and forming even stronger principles by which to evaluate the various challenges of the future. In this I guess I disagree with you and your <i>Birth of a Nation</i> example, John: this is just speculation, but I can't help but think that Americans were benefited by having such a powerful pro-segregation work come to stage at such a relatively early time. We might only imagine that without such clear formulation and presentation it'd have taken generations for the particular historical myth presented by the movie to become acknowledged and refuted in national publicity, and who knows what sort of fruit it would've born with time?<br/><br/>I suppose that this is a pretty weighty difference in opinion, if I truly think that even loathsome messages made with great artistry deserve only reasoning rebuttals instead of vehement moral outrage in polite society. This ties in with <i>Maid</i> as well, I'd say: if a given critic is prone to thinking that nobody should view maid anime due to its misogynist message, they might well think that the <i>Maid</i> rpg is likewise better taken out of circulation just on the off-chance that it'll be used for regressive purposes instead of educational interactions that help the players come to terms with their own views on gender.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254072/#Comment_254072" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T11:03:02+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:03AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, you seem to be repeatedly jumping to the conclusion that if we see something as creepy that we are going to get that thing "taken out of circulation."

You're saying that all discussion has to be carefully reasoned analysis, rather than honestly expressing one's reaction and opinion.  It seems that in your view, I shouldn't come out of a movie theater and say "That was great!" or "That sucked!"  Rather, only attempts at objective analysis backed by reasoned evidence should be communicated.  <br/><br/>That seems incredibly stifling to me.  I feel that if I watch some show, I should feel free to say "That was great!  It was inspiring and uplifting!"  Conversely, I should also feel free to say "That sucked!  It was creepy and offensive."  Now, I'm absolutely in favor of having reasoned analysis as well, but I don't think that should be the only way that we talk about art.  <br/><br/>Regarding you and xenomouse, it sounds to me like you're miscommunicating.  Xenomouse referred to "taking things out of circulation" - whereas you didn't refer to that at all in your response.  For example, I don't want Birth of a Nation to go out of circulation, but I do want it and its viewpoint to be roundly morally condemned in public - and I want this to happen not by legal action, but by open and honest free discussion.  (Incidentally, Birth of a Nation isn't primarily "pro-segregation" - it is primarily a defense of the slave system and portrays denying blacks the right to vote as a heroic move.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254081/#Comment_254081" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T12:00:19+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 12:00PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/01/im_building_a_rape_tunnel.html" rel="nofollow">I'm Building a Rape Tunnel</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254094/#Comment_254094" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T12:58:02+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 12:58PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey droog did you know the Rape Tunnel was actually just some trolling posted to spice up a relatively boring blog.

That's also a pretty big difference, and a relevant one: I do, of course, hold more private opinions to lesser standards of reason and open debate. As I've said many times in this thread, I fully support anybody's right to feel that <i>Maid</i> is a creepy game, especially once they've actually gotten to know the work. I might disagree and I might try to convince them that their opinion is hastily formed and misinformed, as I've in fact done here, but I do think that having and expressing an opinion is OK by itself. Using that opinion as a placeholder for reasoned critique, though, and trying to influence others with the opinion, that's a different matter. I think it's pretty good if any and all substantive claims about the world, art included, are subjected to critical scrutiny insofar as anybody cares. So if somebody's going to claim stuff about a game I've read, and I happen to disagree, I sure will at least consider debating the matter to set the record straight in a free and open manner. This would especially be the case for a topic like this, in which we're essentially discussing the socially proper limits of roleplaying in general; I wouldn't want to let the idea that <i>Maid</i> is somehow a mistake to gain any more ground due to my own negligence. Who knows, I might want to publish a game about a controversial topic myself some day, it'd sort of suck if the hobby were to sway towards a specific political orthodoxy in the meantime.<br/><br/>I guess the difference is between expressing a solicited opinion, such as between friends after seeing a movie, and engaging in active propaganda for your worldview, such as by posting on message boards about a controversial roleplaying game. The rational humanist will require the latter to be based on reasoning debate instead of emotive rhetoric, as doing otherwise will open the doors to injustice. Does that make any sense?<br/><br/>Even if it doesn't, though, that's a pretty philosophical issue, and perhaps not one that will lead to any direct conclusions about <i>Maid</i>. Could I get a restatement of the matter here, perhaps? As I understand it, we're discussing the proper aesthetic basis for judging <i>Maid</i> an ethically suspect work. My own stance has been that not only are Maid's themes rather tame in comparison to common mainstream works, but also that a work cannot be ethically suspect for merely dealing with immoral themes, and thus works like <i>Maid</i>, <i>Birth of a Nation</i>, the Bible or <i>Mein Kampf</i> should be treated with dignity in public debate, even as the work might be dissected and its morals firmly refuted. Specifically this stance of mine is inspired to include people who choose to engage with the above works: condemning <i>Maid</i> as a game only fit for perverts is essentially the same as warning everybody away from the work on the threat of ostracism; this sort of rhetoric is far too strong and unjustified in a free and open cultural environment in which we expect works of art and philosophy to stand on their own and witness for themselves, while the audience makes their own conclusions about their themes. Thus I can subscribe to the idea that <i>Maid</i> is naughty, and to the idea that it's based on a genre with a strong sexist undercurrent - what I can't accept is the idea that either of these facts should lead to a moral judgment on the game itself, especially when that game is largely agnostic on its premise and leaves the themes in actual play for the players to determine. Were <i>Maid</i> to be condemned on these grounds, the only reason I could see for not condemning D&amp;D in the same way would be that we don't consider glorification of vigilante killing to be a bad ideology in the same way that traditional sexism is. For me this is an absurd proposition, and thus I think that works shouldn't be condemned for the themes they include to begin with.<br/><br/>As an interesting comparison, my own chief grudge against <i>Birth of a Nation</i> would not be that it has the wrong opinion on racial politics. My ethical problem with the movie would be that it lies about history and thus argues its case under false precepts. The issue of whether those lies are intentional or just misinformed would be a crucial point were I to need to form an opinion as to whether the whole work (and by extension, its creators) is condemnable. The fact that the work advocates a philosophy I disagree with, in comparison, doesn't alone make the work itself condemnable in my opinion - it just means that I disagree with it. I don't think that works I disagree with need to be morally condemned, I'd rather reserve that step for actual actions. Doing otherwise breeds a dangerous orthodoxy of opinion, one in which people are afraid to bring up alternative ideas and play around with them in art, finding out where they lead.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>That's all still quite distant from the issue of discussing <i>Maid</i>, I'd say. Not that I mind spouting philosophy, but if you guys feel like letting this go, I wouldn't mind. As can be seen from the above, I don't think we really disagree on anything substantial except the subjective issue of whether Maid is creepy or not - and over that I've already tried my best to put the matter to a perspective against similar western works and the general background of lively post-modern cultural landscape, so further exposition probably won't do much. Opinions are opinions in the end, and if <i>Maid</i> feels creepy because it punches the buttons for a person even after reasonable comparison and dissection, what are we to do about it except say that there are people who feel differently, and they're pretty decent blokes as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254101/#Comment_254101" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T13:21:27+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  1:21PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Regarding you and xenomouse, it sounds to me like you're miscommunicating.

That's also a pretty big difference, and a relevant one: I do, of course, hold more private opinions to lesser standards of reason and open debate. As I've said many times in this thread, I fully support anybody's right to feel that <i>Maid</i> is a creepy game, especially once they've actually gotten to know the work. I might disagree and I might try to convince them that their opinion is hastily formed and misinformed, as I've in fact done here, but I do think that having and expressing an opinion is OK by itself. Using that opinion as a placeholder for reasoned critique, though, and trying to influence others with the opinion, that's a different matter. I think it's pretty good if any and all substantive claims about the world, art included, are subjected to critical scrutiny insofar as anybody cares.</blockquote>\nI can't answer your first question simply because it is trying to conflate different qualities, including whether the talk is in public and how informed the opinion is - incidentally implying again the false idea that those who object to Maid haven't read or played it.  <br/><br/>In my opinion, anyone should feel free to express opinions about the Maid RPG, as they don't misrepresent their own knowledge of the game or factually misrepresent the game itself.  There is a difference between speaking in public (i.e. outside a movie theater or in an online forum) and speaking in private (i.e. in an email to friends or verbally in a private space), but I feel that expressing your opinion is fine for both situations.  Further, it is true that their expressed opinions may influence others, and I feel that is absolutely fine.  Opinions can and should be expressed, and expressions can and will influence others.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>So if somebody's going to claim stuff about a game I've read, and I happen to disagree, I sure will at least consider debating the matter to set the record straight in a free and open manner.  This would especially be the case for a topic like this, in which we're essentially discussing the socially proper limits of roleplaying in general; I wouldn't want to let the idea that<i>Maid</i>is somehow a mistake to gain any more ground due to my own negligence. Who knows, I might want to publish a game about a controversial topic myself some day, it'd sort of suck if the hobby were to sway towards a specific political orthodoxy in the meantime.</blockquote>\nSure, and that's exactly how I felt as well - I saw claims about a game that I'd read and played, and I felt there were a lot that I disagreed with.  A major part was the continuing string of claims that those who thought Maid was creepy... <br/><br/>(1) hadn't read the game; (2) hadn't played the game; (3) were prudes and disapproved of any sexual tension in a game; (4) were intolerant of any kink or non-mainstream sexual content; (5) disapproved of RPGs about any controversial topics; and/or (6) were trying to impose a political orthodoxy.  <br/><br/>These are all untrue, and are really ad hominems against those who disapprove - rather than talking about the game itself.  I absolutely oppose a specific political orthodoxy for games, and I approve of many games about controversial topics.  I think that some works will inevitably meet with disapproval - sometimes I disagree with it, but sometimes I agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254187/#Comment_254187" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T23:17:05+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you say about false claims rings true to me, John.  I didn't want to imply that you don't know the game up there, I was just making an off-hand reference to Judd and whoever else might have weighted in based on first impressions earlier in the thread. Still, I'm sure that there's plenty of reason for discourse on both sides of the fence simply to ensure that nobody is unnecessarily painted as a bigot or a pervert. In that regard I think that we've done pretty well here; both pro- and anti-<i>Maid</i> viewpoints have been presented with justifications that make it clear that they are reasoned arguments that stem from valid worldviews and value choices instead of misinformation, bigotry or false logic. If somebody should still choose to not partake of the fruits on this menu due to fundamental resistance against sexist themes in art, it's a choice that I for one wouldn't consider too awful, at least as long as that choice isn't paraded around as a sign of moral superiority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254200/#Comment_254200" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T02:29:20+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  2:29AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jhkim wrote: <i>A major part was the continuing string of claims that those who thought Maid was creepy...<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) hadn't read the game [...]<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all untrue, and are really ad hominems against those who disapprove - rather than talking about the game itself.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nWhile that obviously doesn't apply to everyone, particularly in this thread, I don't think that there's any doubt about forum debates over <i>Maid</i> often resembling a massive game of Telephone more than anything else, with indignant hearsay and vague notions about what such an RPG might be like snowballing into talk about something which really doesn't have much anything to do with the actual book. That's how the discussions wind up with rage against "Hentai <i>FATAL</i>" or odd misconceptions about the PCs being perverse masters who collect maids like so many <i>Pokemon</i> pets. Even the more informed arguments occasionally have a strange tendency of leaping to conclusions about sex being an essential part of play and the primary source of XP for the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254205/#Comment_254205" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T05:32:33+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  5:32AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hayate no Gotoku.

If anything, the objection to D&amp;D is more valid, because there is no sense that the violence in D&amp;D is played for humor.  I think both objections describe a valid reason for avoiding those games, but I don't like it when they're used to imply some moral failing on the part of people who do enjoy the respective games.<br/>\n<br/>\n@MarkW - I suspect that the reason you don't see people objecting to D&amp;D in the same way that you see people objecting to Maid is 2-fold:  Firstly, as you point out the vast majority of RPGs focus on power and violence.  If someone is uncomfortable with that subject matter, they'll never get to this forum in the first place, because they'll never have gotten started playing RPGs.  Secondly, forum readers are much more likely to have experienced, or know someone who has experienced, sexism or sexual abuse, than they are to know someone who has had a similarly traumatic or unpleasant experience with violence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254246/#Comment_254246" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T09:52:55+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  9:52AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still trying to recover from the careless manner in which words like domination and sexual fetish are thrown about here to describe a whacky comedy rpg.

I can't conceive how the game could be considered humorous without those elements, just like I couldn't see how Paranoia could be fun if you removed all the politics and slapstick murder. You'd just have a huge void where there used to be a game. I guess that one might have to <i>hide</i> the facts of <i>Maid</i>'s pedigree in polite society, just like we might not tell the neighbourhood tightass that Paranoia is about murder and political satire. For those purposes we might say that Maid is "just a comedy game" without being too exact about the sort of comedy it entails - but taking that gloss and substituting it for honest analysis seems to make it impossible to actually discuss why it is funny or why some find it offensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div

fetish and gender relations.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, the significance of the maid uniform is built right into the system: under the basic rules the efficiency of the PCs is directly linked to the neatness of their apparel, and when the optional Costume rules come into play, the characters cease to be maids altogether as soon as they change into different clothing (which incidentally also removes them from the authority of the Master since they are then either "off-duty" or engaged in some other line of work). But gender? Aside from the majority of the examples leaning towards female employers, the book explicitly states that in this game sex and gender have no bearing whatsoever even on romance and seduction.

A game is more than its rules, I should think that the rules can claim that gender doesn't matter all day long without it being any more true for that. In fact, I'm sure you'll agree that men and women being rules-wise identical doesn't make this distinction meaningless in any number of other games, almost any game you'd care to name - so why would it do that in <i>Maid</i>? If people can get in tangles over playing a female character in D&amp;D, surely that distinction is much more significant in a game like <i>Maid</i>!<br><br>(Of course that rule you cite from <i>Maid</i> does not mean that gender doesn't matter in general, it just means that there are no mechanical modifiers for homo- or heterosexuality in the game's social conflict mechanics. That's a much weaker claim, and one that is obvious from the text.)<br/><br/>To me it seems obvious that the scenario of <i>Maid</i> and potentially comedic for us as human beings in a big part because it has the potential for all sorts of naughtiness, and naughtiness depends on gender norms. This is not necessary a sex issue (although there are good reproductive reasons for why genders work the way they do), but it very much is a gender one - as part of our understanding of gender we expect a traditional woman to be chaste and servile, which is the very basis of much of the comedy in the maid genre as these traits are exaggerated or refuted in surprising ways. I can't see how one could claim that the gender of a character doesn't matter for our understanding of the events the character gets entangled with - in fact, if you really have this opinion, could you tell us more about it? Would you find it equally hilarious for a male character to beat up his employer after he finds them peeking in the changing room? What seems funny for a woman or other extremely effeminate character to do in this sort of comedy would to my eyes seem like bigoted hate crimes when executed by a man, frankly. It wouldn't be surprising, and thus wouldn't be funny.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, if <i>Maid</i> really didn't involve gender and sexual undertones, the game might as well tell about unisex-uniformed plumbers with handlebar moustaches.

You'd just have a huge void where there used to be a game. I guess that one might have to<i>hide</i>the facts of<i>Maid</i>'s pedigree in polite society, just like we might not tell the neighbourhood tightass that Paranoia is about murder and political satire. For those purposes we might say that Maid is "just a comedy game" without being too exact about the sort of comedy it entails - but taking that gloss and substituting it for honest analysis seems to make it impossible to actually discuss why it is funny or why some find it offensive.</blockquote>\nBut that's not what I'm saying at all. Nobody is talking about removing or whitewashing anything. Paul got the gist of it. It's the "how" that's the issue here, not the "what". And this "how" has to do with the words we choose to describe the "what". I think it's unfair, inappropriate and disingenious to call Maid a game about sexual fetish and domination. <br/><br/>Does the game use and play with imagery that has sexual connotations? Of course it does. You'd have to be blind to not see that.<br/><br/>Does it play with the tension, awkwardness and outrageous behaviour that can be associated with that sexual connotation? Yes, it does. That's the whole point. That's where the humour comes from.<br/><br/>Is Maid about looking at a specific sexual fetish and fantasies of domination or control over women? Just say it out loud. Let that question roll over your tongue. Look up what fetish means. Look up what domination means. And then try to say with a straight face that this game is about thematically exploring either of those two things.<br/><br/>A game where a zombie outbreak can randomly occur around the mansion to provide the maids with a challenge to solve.<br/><br/>..."is about fantasies of domination".<br/><br/>A game where a giant robot might come to the mansion to cause trouble.<br/><br/>..."is about the sexual fetish of women dressing up as maids".<br/><br/>A game where an unexploded warhead is found under the mansion and needs to be dealt with.<br/><br/>..."is about appealing to some sexual kink".<br/><br/>Maid is not about exploring the plight of a young woman caught in rigid, oppressive servitude to a man. It's not about pushing the "pedestrian boundaries and sexual mores of the mundanes" by having players deal with unignorable gender roles, that are hardwired into the game. It is definitely not about dressing up and playing naughty. <br/><br/>It's a wacky roleplaying game about maids. If you honestly think that there is some fringe sexuality at the core of this game, that this is somehow Maid's thematic centre... then it's not the game people should be creeped out about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254332/#Comment_254332" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T14:58:25+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  2:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>The simple fact is that if the principles in the story were, as you say, big moustachio'd plumbers instead of scantily dressed sexy girls, then it stops being lighthearted and fun, and starts being really problematic.</blockquote>\nI dunno, I think that could be hilarious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254343/#Comment_254343" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T15:45:00+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  3:45PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Georgios, seems like we're mostly disagreeing on mere terminology there. I did not claim that the game "is about" domination fantasies in any concrete and explicit way - I think it's pretty clear that I'm discussing the subtext we as an audience read into the events in the game, thus obtaining significance from them. I don't think I have the tools at the moment to convince you if you disagree, but to me it seems utterly obvious that something like the maid-master relationship can't possibly convey interest and comedic tension without there being a domination fantasy subtext the audience is appreciating on some level. I guess we could try a little thought experiment, though: if we had a person who had no knowledge or experience of sexual domination fantasies or uniform fetishes or standards of chastity, would he be able to create and appreciate the sort of comedy we often see in this genre? If he could, then I'd have to concede that apparently the game doesn't involve this sort of thing nearly to the degree I read in there.<br/><br/>Still, it seems that your problem is mostly with the words we use to describe this relationship of fetishes to the game, as you do admit that the humour of the game comes from these exact things I mention, and even that this is in fact obvious. I don't really know what to say about that, as I don't find the sexual subtext of the game to be any more problematic than it is in various superhero games, costume dramas, teen comedies and almost any other genre you'd care to name. Sexuality is universally present in human culture, I don't know what else to call it than whitewashing when somebody takes the exact phenomenon under purview and insists that in this case the sexual subtext is somehow not to be mentioned, and this particular work needs to be considered as "only a comedy". I don't even know what that could mean with a comedic work where half of the comedy involves various references to the sexual subtext. Do you just mean that we should not mention the sort of comedy <i>Maid</i> involves because talking about it is a perversion?<br/><br/>Actually, let's try this: could you, Georgios, put it in your own words? How should I express the fact that Maid's comedy largely stems from playing with gender and sexual mores if not by saying just that? Apparently you had some problem with the way I phrased this - to such an extent in fact, that you're considering what I said to be creepy. As it seems that we agree on the substance of the issue, I don't really mind if you'll instruct me on the proper way to phrase the matter so that I don't make you think that I advocate explicit pornography or whatever as part of the play experience.<br/><br/>Also, John: Georgios here gives a perfect example of how to get me to emerge from the woodwork. He just implied that I'm a pervert others should be creeped about because I think that gender and a certain set of fetish conventions are central to the comedy in the maid genre. This is the sort of thing that no doubt keeps this discussion going well past its best-before date.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254365/#Comment_254365" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T17:28:35+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  5:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2010 5:28PM by Georgios.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite> I guess we could try a little thought experiment, though: if we had a person who had no knowledge or experience of sexual domination fantasies or uniform fetishes or standards of chastity, would he be able to create and appreciate the sort of comedy we often see in this genre?

The game's humour works best if you presuppose a very innocent, simple and naive view on sexuality for the game. Only then can you create the kind of tension that makes one laugh. Only then is it funny to have the Master accidentally or even intentionally see the maids change clothes, and turn bright red whenever he sees them. Only then does it get a chuckle, when he falls asleep in the lap of one of the maids and she gets nosebleeds from being so tense. Only then is it hillarious when a character goes into fits of sweat from mishearing an innocuous comment and mistaking it for a decleration of lust for another character.<br/><br/>If you approach Maid with the assumption that there is a subtext of fetishism and sexually charged power-play going on, none of the situations above are funny. They are tame and pointless maybe, but not funny. Instead all those scenes will develop a dynamic of their own, droning in on gender-based power play and objectification of women. Which is not even close to what Maid is about.<br/><br/>I think you, Eero, are carelessly throwing about words like kink and fetish, without realising their connotations. This isn't about "mere terminology". It's calling a polite argument "an ideological war". It's like slapping your 4-year-old on the hand to keep him from touching the burning stove and somebody else calling that "child abuse". \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>How should I express the fact that Maid's comedy largely stems from playing with gender and sexual mores if not by saying just that?</blockquote>\nI wish you would. But you keep bringing up fetishism (when you seem to mean stererotypical types of attractive outfits - I happen to find women in short skirts attractive, but that does not mean I have a short skirt fetish) and domination (when you seem to mean inflexible gender roles -  which are hardwired into the game via its basic set up of maids serving the master of the house). And that just makes this game, people who play this game and even people who vaguely associate with this game seem connected with something seedy and dirty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254371/#Comment_254371" name="Item_209" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T17:57:50+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  5:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the dirt in this case is pretty much in your mind, I've intended no degradation of the game in my characterization of it. If I understand you correctly, you're basically objecting to me using words that have bad connotations for you. I'm the first to confess that I'm not an authority in the different registers of English, so it is entirely possible that I use the wrong or even impolite words for the language when I characterize the allure of panty shots or corsets as a "fetish", for instance. If this is so, however, I don't see this as a particularly serious issue - you should be able to understand what I mean from the context, shouldn't you? Just tell me the words I should be using, and perhaps explain to me how I'm mispresenting my case by using the wrong terminology, and that should solve the issue, I think. I mean no disrespect towards anybody's sexuality by using the word "fetish" - in my native language the word is commonly used to mean any sexualization of objects and behaviors not directly involved in the act of sex itself, including the short skirts you mentioned, as well as panty shots, corsettes, hairbows, stockings and other such common elements of maid anime. I am honestly surprised that this is not the case in English as well.<br/><br/>Insofar as I've understood this thread, nobody here is claiming that <i>Maid</i> is explicitly and/or pornographically involved with sexual fetishes of any sort, which seems to be your complaint as I understand it. Rather, the consensus largely seems to be that the game's central theme is comedic, concerning, among other things, views and expectations over gender and sexuality, focusing specifically at certain conventional elements of the genre, such as uniforms, authority relationships and so on.

Male maid ("Butler") who is naive about sexuality and was <i>sold</i> by his parents to cover their debts, 12 year old female master who is in love with him and dresses him up in sexually degrading outfits (well, he objects, as a cat-girl), the older female maid who takes care of things, and the crazy old butler.

One of the players was shocked and refused to do it, claiming that it was degrading to her. Engaging this complaint by talking about authority, gender roles and the like... is simply ridiculous. It's the kind of complaint that one should get laughed out of the room for. <br/><br/>I think it's not much different with Maid. Arguing about how Maid incorporates gender, sexuality and authority to provide comedy in order to address complaints about Maid being based on fetishism and domination fantasies, is really just implicitly validating complete nonsense. I'm not saying you cannot use Maid as a launching point for a discussion about gender, sexuality and authority - as this thread shows - but I am convinced that once you do, you move away from talking about the game with giant leaps.<br/><br/>Again, I am not saying that there is no trace of these issues in the game whatsoever. But I do think they are a distant backdrop, secondary or even tertiary colour so to speak, to the point that talking about them in exclusion to everything else that happens in the game aggressively skews one's perspective. It's why I don't agree with your claim that you are talking about the game's subtext. I think you are (whether you want to or not) rearranging the "text", that is pushing elements into the foreground that interest you, to talk about some issues that vaguely inform the story game experience, but do not drive or effect the gameplay.<br/><br/>My point, put simply, is that this discussion has latched on to a tangent of the game and makes it look as if it was representative of the game's focus, theme and topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254481/#Comment_254481" name="Item_214" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T10:18:03+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 10:18AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well put Georgios.

However, the second step of character creation is rolling twice on the female stereotype table, with many of the six results having sexual connotations (like Lolita, Sexy, and Pure).  The stereotypes and your uniform come <i>before</i> your background (Roots), personality traits (like Stress Explosion), and power.  <br/><br/>Similarly, I might expect a distant backdrop to not show up in resolution rules until after the first few pages.  However, the basic rules are introduced by an extended example of sexual harrassment, driven by a sample PC's Womanizer perversion quality.  There is one page on basic die-rolling and one page on combat illustrated through this example, and then one page on maid uniforms where the example goes farther.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254495/#Comment_254495" name="Item_216" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T10:55:31+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 10:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say that speaking of practical every-day life instead of nattering on forums, Georgios, I'm in complete agreement - it is ridiculous to be offended or suspicious of something as harmless as <i>Maid</i>, it simply doesn't deserve it. Still, how else are we to address concerns others have if not by taking them seriously and trying to engage them in an equal, rational manner? Just saying that others are wrong and refusing to discuss the matter in detail doesn't increase mutual understanding or convince anybody of anything.<br/><br/>For your charge that this angle of discussion ends up misreading the text, I can only admit that this is a clear possibility. I haven't dragged out the book and given it a fresh read for this, so I'm just working from what I took away from it when reading it a couple of months back. To me it seems that you're making a somewhat superficial reading by picking on zombies or giant robots as important aspects of the game when they're just largely incidental distractions that are merely drawn out for the comedy value of breaking setting expectations - likewise I don't think that the multiple adventure frameworks in the game are <i>central</i> to it even if they are amply supported; what the characters do in the game is similar to adventuring, agreed, and they do not in fact spend the typical scenario in a tight loop of being constantly ordered around by the master. However, the characters' indentities as maids still seem to me like the overriding concern in what they do and how they do it, while the adventure or other framework offered by the GM's scenario or random tables seems to me to just be something for the characters to react to, to give the players a chance to express their characters - a backdrop for the character comedy, if you will.<br/><br/>As Paul earlier alluded, I think that de-emphasizing the identity of maids in <i>Maid</i> and considering the adventure slapstick as primary in analyzing the game is a lot like analyzing <i>Paranoia</i> as being "about" the funny experimental equipment that gets doled out to the troubleshooters. That equipment is content, sure, but insofar as there is an overarching context for the content in the game, it's the totalitarian dystopic state structure of the setting. In this sense the game is "about" poking fun at totalitarian dystopism, just like <i>Maid</i> is "about" making fun of gender stereotypes, including sexual mores. That's simply the over-arching situation of the game.<br/><br/>You said that the way I discuss the game gives people a wrong and perverted impression of it, but I think that the impression I would give of myself would be disingenious if I claimed that anybody seeing suspicious sexual subtext in the game is just a dirty-minded pervert, like you did up there. Anybody who in fact does see such a subtext is not going to be convinced by me simply claiming that it's not there, especially when I see it quite clearly myself. It seems much more reasonable to me to admit that the game is what it is and try to explain why I don't find it any more bothersome for it.<br/><br/>Still, that's just a matter of disagreement in literary critique, hardly a serious issue. It's not exactly the first time that people disagree on what a text "means". I haven't found this to have any great impact on practical usage of a text in the past.<br/><br/>John: good points in the details of the text, I concur with your reading there. Those examples of play in the book are pretty embarrassing, probably the best case for a judgmental reading in the book all told. If there is something in there to get offended about, that running example is probably it. I didn't find it too much myself due to how obviously artificial and jokish it was; it was not really an example of play so much as the author writing dialogue and breaking the fourth wall constantly to demonstrate some rules mechanics. There was no implication that there is a player playing the harassed character, for instance, nor any suggestion that players should be brow-beaten the way characters might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254505/#Comment_254505" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T11:46:18+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 11:46AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have serious doubts that the order in which aspects of a character are determined during character creation says anything about what drives the gameplay. In Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay you pick your race first. Does that somehow suggest that WFRP is about racism? The first thing you choose in Paranoia is a name and gender. Does that make Paranoia a game about identity politics?<br/><br/>I'm sorry, John but I don't see this as a valid argument. Whether something is central to the game or a "distant background" is determined by the things that drive the game's plot forward. It's what players and GM are keeping in mind when choosing how to let their respective characters act and react. Gender, sexuality and/or authority are not the themes that drive Maid's gameplay. The game's scenes are not supposed to follow somebody's desire to explore gender roles. Situations do not develop because players comment on sexuality through the way they let their characters act. And the plot development is not driven by trying to lay bare the mechanisms of power between maid and master.<br/><br/>If there is one theme that drives player characters in Maid, it's wanting to be liked. That's all. That's the ominious subtext of the game, and the driving force of every adventure. The reasons for the maids wanting to be liked do not matter. You can pick anything you want, anything you enjoy or you consider funny. The maid might have a crush. She might see it as a cutthroat competition with the other maids. Or she might be a cyborg programmed to seek the master's approval. She might just be the kind of person, who wants to be liked. It does not really matter why she wants to gain favour, she just does. It's what maids in this game do.<br/><br/>You have characters single-mindedly persuing a goal (Master's favour) and the complications that keep them from achieving it (embarassing situations, misunderstandings, etc.) is where you find the game's humour. And only here does gender and sexuality come into play. It's here that you can make use of gendered behaviour, innuendo, sexually charged situations and the embarressment it can cause to make people at your table laugh. To make yourself laugh.<br/><br/>And if you don't consider a lecherous master lusting after his maids and getting smacked in the face for it funny, then don't introduce a lecherous master lusting after his maids into the game. If you don't find characters utterly oblivious as to how attractive they are funny, then don't use such characters. All these elements are there to be used for humour. They are there to be thrown into the game and letting the group engage with them in a way that makes them laugh. <br/><br/>It can be as innocent and cute or as naughty and edgy as you want. But it's about making you and your group laugh. It's a light comedy RPG about maids. Which apparently is a far more difficult concept to accept than I thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254506/#Comment_254506" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T11:47:24+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 11:47AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            re: Paranoia.<br/><br/>Actually, what Paranoia is about is spelled out in the title of the game itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254512/#Comment_254512" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:07:15+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:07PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There seems to be a lot of defense of Maid against the opinion that "it's creepy."

So I am certainly a bit jaded at this point.  But I also assume most other people are as well, that's why it comes as a bit of a shock to me when thinking of Maid makes otherwise rational and experienced people "spit up blood".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254524/#Comment_254524" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:49:17+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2010 12:54PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>There seems to be a lot of defense of Maid against the opinion that "it's creepy."

One is to describe a scary movie or a haunted house. The other  is to describe men of an unsavory sort, the kind that are regarded as possible sexual predators or unwanted stalkers. As a man with an interest in this game, the idea that something I enjoy and me by extension is being called creepy does bother me. A lot. So yes, I am worried that enough threads like this and my interest in a book that, much like walker's was not based in anything sexual whatsoever, will implicate me as someone "creepy" and I'll be in the same category as people who play FATAL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254529/#Comment_254529" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:58:55+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>There seems to be a lot of defense of Maid against the opinion that "it's creepy."

I could ask where all the energy to say how the game is creepy, and why it <i>really</i> is, comes from. Of course, fighting the good fight. But the thing is, for the same reason it's important to people to explain why something is problematic and thus they don't like it, it's important to explain to people who do like it why it is not problematic, or not as problematic.<br/><br/>And yeah, that was sort of rude.

Are you worried that those of us with the opinion "creepy" will look down on those who actually play the game?</blockquote>\nWell, for me it's mostly a matter of defending liberal values in the field of rpgs. I really like it that rpgs can be considered a flexible art form, and it'd be a shame to see it turning towards bowdlerization as creators and activists (of whom this site also has its share) learn that you're going to be branded with the pervert brand if your game doesn't toe some ill-defined line of propriety, a line that in practical terms will be controlled by anybody willing to take the lead in drumming up the witch hunt. So I'm mostly showing support for a point in cultural politics. This is, of course, ridiculous in the case of <i>Maid</i>, which really is a rather non-explicit and comedic game - one would expect both of those facts to counter much of the suspicion in a world where other rpg publishers have done business for years on something like vampire games, which usually have much more explicit and serious theming of sexual violence going for them.<br/><br/>Also, as a practical matter of rhetoric, it seems to me that calling another person (or their work, or work they choose to partake in) creepy or pervert is a pretty heavy charge. In my everyday life those sorts of terms are only chosen by overreacting conservatives striving to limit civil liberties, and people with actual civil rights concerns towards minors or other people being hurt by the creepy perversions. So using this particular rhetoric with <i>Maid</i> seems to me like it's either a bid for establishing a social ostracism against the game or an actual allusion to serious, illegal and harmful perversion on the part of anybody willing to associate with the game. Either motivation seems very contemptible to me, so I'm interested in discussing the matter and figuring out why people feel so strongly about the game as to make them use terminology better suited for fringe conservatives or discussing sex criminals.<br/><br/>(I do notice the irony in how Georgios accuses me of provocative language while I also find his own choice of words rather extreme. Different idioms in action, to be sure. I had no idea that fetishes and prudence could be so provocative terms.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254548/#Comment_254548" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T13:57:09+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  1:57PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2010 1:57PM by xenomouse.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>Sorry for the pedantry, just don't really see the purpose questioning the fans' motives in defending the game they like against a pejorative term.</blockquote>I don't really consider "creepy" anything more than a subjective judgment.

Again, I never made any judgments against the people who play Maid, nor do I recall seeing anyone in this thread doing so.  I've had coworkers who considered roleplaying in general "creepy."

If something is "creepy" to me, it just means that I feel uneasy around something.  I feel uneasy around LARPing, but I have friends who LARP.

As I've said earlier in the thread, if we take "creepy" to mean nothing more than surprise and lack of personal comfort with the subject matter, then there's not much to object to there, really. I might try to convince you to give the game another shot, but even that'd require me to care a bit more than I do - there are plenty of interesting games out there, no reason to play the ones that don't motivate you on their own. Most of this thread has been spent in figuring out whether those feelings of creepiness can be justified on a more objective level, of course, which, as we've seen, can inspire quite long and wordy deliberations.<br/><br/>I won't defend FATAL, it seemed a pretty bad game when I leafed through it years ago. Infantile and not very honest about its ideological underpinnings.

(The moral debasement part comes in when your own attitudes towards the material are in fact morally debased, which is not nearly always the case when people engage bad art with bad ideas.)

In my experience the great majority of anime fans do not consume their entertainment with blind acceptance of this sort of societal subtext; rather, they find quaint amusement, bitter irony, critical comedy or simple idle nostalgia in this material.<br/><br/>Even if a fan of the genre might get all starry-eyed about how "cute" a fawnish harem comedy strumpet can be, this does not in any way translate to an acceptance of female submission in the real world; the processes we use in being an audience for culture are not simple blind absorption, but rather a constant internal and external dialogue that benefits not only from "right" ideas, but also from the "wrong" ones. Anime fans I've known (I'm thinking of the female fans of this sort of comedy, specifically) can go to great lengths in seemingly idolizing regressive harem comedies without this having any impact on their own identities as modern, independent and liberal people; just like a fan of costume drama might pick the cues for their fashion sense and behavior of Southern Belles without wanting a return to slave-owning plantation days, a modern teenage girl can well enjoy anime and its usually rather conservative depiction of gender with full awareness of the distinction between fact and fiction.<br/><br/>Both men and women enjoy the sentimental value in conservatism, even if geek boys mostly slake this thirst with sword &amp; sorcery imagery. This is the reason for why I don't myself consider a game like <i>Maid</i> creepy for its superficially gender-conservative any more than I'd consider WWF wrestling to be such; this art might invoke strange worlds of alien morality for my benefit, but like the great majority of art, I have freedom to parse it and reject or accept any lessons the process might impart for me. If anything, I'd expect that people learn to be more aware of women as people now that genres like harem comedy are gaining in traction in the media landscape.<br/><br/>Hmm, I liked that paragraph for a change. Some of these impromptu debate posts have grown a bit long in the tooth, but the above is conscise and to the point.

I am fairly comfortable with the idea about a horror game portraying vampires as sexual predators.  It is serious subject matter, but the sexualized violence is generally portrayed as evil.  There is sometimes an element of glorification that I am disturbed by - i.e. "vampires are evil, but they're cooler than the good guys."  However, that's delving into specifics of other games that I would want to deal with specifically.  <br/><br/><br/>I don't think that being a non-explicit comedy makes a work inherently any less disturbing.  For example, I don't think that Steal Away Jordan would be any less disturbing if it were done as a comedy game that skipped over the darker, more explicit issues of slavery in the American South.  Far from it, really.  I think it would be at least as creepy and probably moreso.  <br/><br/>Similarly, some people expressed that playing Maid as instead a game of playing mustached valets would be more disturbing - but again I don't think so.  It seems absolutely no less disturbing to me to play that game, and indeed, I'd be personally more interested in playing such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254918/#Comment_254918" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T21:25:25+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  9:25PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are indeed pretty substantial differences in how we approach art, John. My instincts would be opposite - if <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> were a comedy, there would be more distance between me and the human suffering it depicts, and thus whatever hesitation I might have for delving into the game's world would be less. Therefore it would "bother" me (in the sense of the term established earlier) less. It seems to me that if you're getting more bothered by a comedic SAJ than the serious game, that might be because you're bothered by the political implications - you're worried about what others or your own super-ego or Santa Claus might think about you making the funny with a touchy issue. We see this now and then: people usually get offended by comedy because they think that the comedian doesn't understand and appreciate the real issues behind his act. Does that sound right? If so, then we might have two slightly distinct sorts of emotional reaction here.<br/><br/>I think that <i>Vampire</i> is in many ways a rather disturbed work - actually, that whole genre is peculiar in literature, it takes all the suspect philosophical bits from pulp and mixes it up into a weird subcultural exceptionalism perfectly suitable for teenagers. Thus I agree that both Vampire and Maid deal with potentially powerful philosophical issues - I'd have to think about it long and hard to say which is "worse" as a guidebook to life or as an incidious work of subliminal propaganda, but I think I'd go with <i>Vampire</i> overall. It's mostly the comedy thing again, I admit, as I have difficulty getting offended by a treatise on master-slave relations that constantly breaks out in bouts of ridicule towards the master. Vampire presents similar themes with the various sorts of blood slavery it involves, and I have to say that it's not been always too critical about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent" title="GrimGent"><img alt="GrimGent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GrimGent">GrimGent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254971/#Comment_254971" name="Item_239" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T05:37:47+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  5:37AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero Tuovinen wrote: <i>It's mostly the comedy thing again, I admit, as I have difficulty getting offended by a treatise on master-slave relations that constantly breaks out in bouts of ridicule towards the master.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention, once again, that the maids aren't slaves, but employees. (Well... <i>usually</i> that's true: you could always roll 13 or 14 on the background chart, in which case they are.) It's assumed that they have personal reasons for staying around. Getting fired in disgrace is considered the worst possible outcome in the game (although even the Special Qualities include the possibility of the characters having other jobs on the side, as for instance a doctor); but in a modern-day setting at least, if they really <i>wanted</i> out, they could simply quit. And as said before, changing from the uniform into another Costume also means they can't be ordered around, since they aren't really working as maids at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Buckley" title="Sean Buckley"><img alt="Sean Buckley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/b/c/c/member_12459884.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Buckley">Sean Buckley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329716/#Comment_329716" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T14:32:47+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  2:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently trying to find some writing about how maid culture is perceived by the Japanese.
