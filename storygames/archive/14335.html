Terminology used in the game reflected this fact. For example, adventures were divided into sub units known as "acts" and "scenes". Conflict resolution also reflected the cinematic nature of the game. Actions were resolved by a player rolling a twenty sided die against a difficulty number. The degree by which the roll exceeded the difficulty number of the task influenced how successful the player was at the action. Rolls of 10 or 20 allowed the player to roll again, adding their new roll to the old. This could be continued indefinitely as long as the player rolled 10 or 20, allowing for fantastic feats in a cinematic style. The wound system, which stressed incapacitating damage over lethal kinds, also mimicked the style of adventure films, wherein the hero may often be incapacitated, but is rarely killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, Torg used an unusual card based system to augment gameplay. A hand of cards were dealt to each player at the beginning of the game. The rest were stacked in front of the game master. Cards could be used by both players and game masters to influence play. Whenever a combat encounter began the game master would flip over a card which would dictate certain advantages and disadvantages for the players and the NPCs. Players could also use cards to give themselves advantages or even plotlines which could result in extra points.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers were rewarded with "possibility points." These points could, as in most games, be spent to improve the characters abilities. However, unlike in most roleplaying games, possibility points, or "possibility energy" also existed as an in-game phenomenon, and characters could spend them to achieve certain effects, such as healing, or warping reality.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Torg is designed to allow players to derive enjoyment from how characters, equipment, and environments of the various realities interact, such as having Terminator-style futuristic cyborgs adventure alongside Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style mages in an Indiana Jones-style pulp setting. It also allows playing a game with an explicitly epic or 'cinematic' overtone (as in Star Wars or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as opposed to RPGs like Vampire: The Masquerade or Dungeons &amp; Dragons).<br/>\n<br/>\nTorg provides a unified mechanics system suitable for any setting; character attributes and game mechanics use a single sliding scale ('18' can equally mean an hour of time, a truckload of weight, an expert markman's skill, or $4,000) and a unified method of task resolution involving a d20. At the same time it provides an open-ended die mechanic: one twenty-sided die roll, read through a bonus chart, gives the bonus to a character's skill for that attempt. Barring special circumstances, the die may be rolled again (and the subsequent total added to the first roll) each time a 10 or a 20 is rolled. Along with re-rolls gained through spent possibilities, card play, and other possible influences, this allows truly spectacular feats to be accomplished by player characters.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSounds pretty awesome!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325629/#Comment_325629" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T10:59:10+00:00" title="May 21, 2011 10:59AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started to write a long description of the reasons Torg wasn't successful, but then I looked on Wikipedia and noticed there's an entire section devoted specifically devoted to the game's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torg#Drawbacks" rel="nofollow">drawbacks</a>.<br><br>Torg was initially a neat idea, though--you're totally right.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325630/#Comment_325630" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T11:48:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2011 11:48AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a regular <i>Torg</i> group going on 20 years ago now.

Also, the globetrotting nature of the game made it hard to have recurring NPCs/plots unless they too were globetrotters.

It kind of is a setting in search of a system-- it has a lot of interesting ideas, but the mechanics it has are so-so at best and have a late-eighties feel that has not aged well at all, unless you really love rolling dice then inputting that result into a table to get a value to add to your stat that you then finally compare to the difficulty.  The game also has the amusingly-named "glass ninja problem"; if you roll well enough to hit someone with a high dodge value, that roll is likely high enough to one-shot kill them.<br><br/>There is a kernel of brilliance in the Drama Deck, but I'm at a loss of how to extract that awesome from the mediocre system it's embedded in, and from what I know of Masterbook West End couldn't figure it out either.  Also, the spell creation rules in the magical cosm book (Aysle) are some of the most pointlessly crunchy things I've ever encountered and need to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>All that said, we had some good gonzo fun with it for a few sessions-- it's hard to be mad at any game that lets you play a flying telepathic starfish (we made him wear a fez on one of his arms so we non-radially-symmetric types could have a "face" to converse with), and I had a good laugh when my Nippon Tech martial-arts guy disconnected from his native reality in the middle of the dinosaur jungle universe eating Canada and discovered the ambient tech level was too low for my nunchucks to function.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/azrianni" title="azrianni"><img alt="azrianni" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/azrianni">azrianni</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325670/#Comment_325670" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-22T05:23:05+00:00" title="May 22, 2011  5:23AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had fun with this for just a session or two.

I always wanted to play Torg, but couldn't find the worldbooks back then.<br/>I found the system highly functional in play*, with many features that stood out at the time, like explicit systemic support for using specific on-combat skills in combat, and encouraging player control of the narrative through plot cards. The drama deck itself was brilliant for combat, but also supported interesting mechanical subsystems, enabling for instance a GM to create a tense skill challenge _on the fly_, like disarm this bomb before the train reaches the city, while fighting a horde of ninjas, and allowing everyone to have something to contribute to both the fight and the disarming. The pacing of that skill challenge would be handled by the system and the drama deck, perfectly naturally.<br/><br/>*The criticism above about having to look on a table for your bonus, is valid, but it is basically the same as a fate player having to look on a list of traits to see that Amazing is higher than Superb, or Dust Devils players have to remember whether a flush is better than a straight, etc.  It's something that many players will internalise, and others won't be able to, but won't have to since it's a tiny table printed on the character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325879/#Comment_325879" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T11:42:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 11:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in one of the TORG playtest campaigns that played through the modules while they were in development in '90 and '91.

And I still haven't seen it really capture well in modern cinematic games.<br/><br/>The Drama Deck drives combats to be more dynamic.  Lot of lightweight/story games still boil down to "I hit my opponent again" for a while until one side wins.  The drama deck stirs the pot quite a bit.  This round, your opponents are energized (might be a good time for all-out defense?)  This round, you'll get a card draw (kind of an action point) if you out-maneuver your opponent.  This round, your side gets a free re-roll on attacks (pull out the big guns!)  This can/should make the combat situation change from round to round, so you can feel like you're in trouble without feeling like you're going to lose.  It also feels like you're seizing the moment rather than trading rolls back and forth.  The other half of the drama deck is using the cards like Fate points/action points.  This set up also feeds the dramatic pacing.  You have to play a card in front of you before you can use it, and you can only play one card a turn.  An ideal TORG (dramatic) combat is set up so that the heroes are considerably weaker than the villains.  So the heroes start off getting beaten bad early.  It takes them a few rounds of getting beaten on to get cards into their pools.  Then the right moment (read: initiative card) hits, they pull out all the stops with a few Drama cards, some help, and some positioning (like previous maneuvers) and hammer home the winning blow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the system is classic 90s sim-heavy (if you'll excuse the term) stuff.  So it's still often better to take your cover bonus, and lay down fire with your AK47 and kevlar armor.<br/><br/>I'd actually really like to see a modern take on TORG drama deck combat.  I'd started fiddling with it as more of a DnD4e hack.  But it might be better on its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325997/#Comment_325997" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T17:48:35+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  5:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can see in Torg's Drama Deck an attempt at things like the open Traits of<i> Hero Wars</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i>, <i>The Poo</i>l and other games, where you get a bonus for descriptively adding some descriptive quality resource you have at hand (the card in Torg, the Traits in the other games) to get a bonus for your roll.<br/><br/>The Deck was the part I cared about, and I credit Greg Gordon with working so hard to come up with something to paste onto the standard statblock design.
