Something similar to how <i>Wraith: The Oblivion</i> used to work. One of said friends said that the mechanic didn't work.<br/><br/>Personally, I have no direct experience with Wraith, so I could only tell him that I felt the problem was with the System (Lumpley's way), not with the concept itself not working. But I felt I need a little more information about how things really worked in there.<br/><br/>And then I decided to come here with my doubts and concerns.<br/><br/>So, Story-Games people, how were your experiences with the game? What worked? What didn't? Did that interaction ever resulted in some cool roleplaying? How often was that particular rule ignored? Which were the most memorable play experiences you recall?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298207/#Comment_298207" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T13:53:47+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  1:53PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadowguide worked masterfully, because it took kibitzing about "what you should do" and put it into the voice of a very sinister character. Not only were the characters screwed because the GM was portraying a bleak, dreadful world, but their friend was across the table portraying something that wanted them to fall into the abyss.  The only thing that kept the game from being unbearable was that at character creation you made your character's noblest (or meanest) aspirations the central focus of everything you did. Pretty great stuff.<br/><br/>The Shadowguide rule was never ignored, it was used all the time, every time, and it never failed. It was the pure genius innovation of that game.

What would be the point? Leveraging your kewl powerz while you fought off other wraiths, I guess. And they were in fact super-kewl, but the Shadowguide is what IMO made Wraith a personal story again.<br/><br/>We had terrific luck with the system here. I ran a very successful 5 player game and we just round-robin'ed the Shadowguide role: player to your left at chargen is your Shadowguide. We had bully shadowguides, we had BFF shadowguides (by far the most effective and sinister), we had ooga booga scary shadowguides. It was great. It also gave players something to do while they weren't in a scene.<br/><br/>This was a lot of years ago but IIRC there was a "harrowing" mechanic, something having to do with plunging your wraith into her own "instance" type thing.

And Jenny is playing Chuck's shadowguide. Jenny is this festively plump, very happy girl. Total Campbell's soup kid. Chuck is this affable, easy-going guy. They're friendly acquaintances outside the game; Jenny is married to one of Chuck's very good friends.<br/><br/>Within the Wraith system, the Shadow can provide pretty substantial mechanical help to the Wraith. This comes at a cost: IIRC there's some slowly elevating value that ticks up every time you accept the Shadow's help. At certain points, I think, the Shadow could take a swing at taking the Wraith over. I think when that value topped out, that's when that Harrowing thing would happen -- and the Wraith would have to pass through this metaphysical battle with the Shadow, whose ultimate goal is to pull its Wraith into Oblivion. It's the only meaningful game-over state. Oh wait... your soul could also be forged into stuff for bigger badder Wraiths as well. But anyway, Oblivion was super mega bad.<br/><br/>Back to Jenny. So Jenny would offer help to Chuck's Wraith at the drop of a hat but do it in a totally sunny, happy, nonconfrontational way. Basically the Shadow *was* Jenny: very sweet, super supportive, like totally a hippie mom. Chuck, being an affable guy but also acutely aware of the possibilities of the Shadow, starts out really cautious (he's trying to play mega-scary monster Shadow to his target, so Jenny's approach is so weird and different he's not sure what's up). By the end of the third session, though, they're just laughing and having a great time! Jenny's passing help dice to Chuck, Chuck's totally rocking his scenes.<br/><br/>Top of scene four, Chuck's within a point or whatever of getting his harrowing. He asks Jenny straight up, "So ... do you have something planned for this Harrowing?" And she perks up immediately, "Oh jeez no! I totally forgot about that whole thing. I guess I can come up with something." So sure enough, Chuck takes that last bit of help from Jenny's Shadow...and then Jenny drops the fucking hammer on him inside the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>She of course has been thinking about the harrowing since turn 1. Since before turn 1 probably! She's been noodling on it for weeks at this point. She's *still* sunny and sweet, but now this Campbell's Soup Girl is describing this crazy Harrowing scene. I can't even remember the details of it but she's dug deep into player Chuck's own personal bugaboos. This is one of those lines-and-veils things that came up way before anyone had really sketched it out. Wraith had a "safeword" mechanic, though, and Chuck in fact actually invoked his safeword.<br/><br/>So anyway, it was the fact that the Shadowguide player was just so very easy to get along with and never, ever presented a reason to not trust her. IIRC he actually ended up slipping into Oblivion as a result of that Harrowing scene, and was happy to call it quits on the campaign itself. It was a very powerful, very potent moment of play that nobody had the tools to deal with. Chuck thought everyone had agreed that nobody would get hurt; Jenny assumed Chuck would not abandon her.<br/><br/>I still consider this a success story, although in this day and age I think you'd have to work hard to set social expectations within your play group more explicitly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298220/#Comment_298220" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T15:21:46+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  3:21PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah...

He changed my character. Without asking. The second was when I was going to run a game and the same guy created a character who was 'a 13 year old girl'.

It is still my favorite game of all the White Wolf games, and the least loved, because there's a level of trust that goes with playing your friend's Shadow that I think most people fear to allow.  It's the control of your character's will removed and put in the hands of someone who is using your very own character to destroy you.   That's incredibly scary for some people, and one of the most beautiful options of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played a game with the Shadow power Freudian Slip, and it turned a whole session into a disaster engine, where no player could defeat their Shadows that day.  We were on an express train to Oblivion.  Kudos to our Storyteller, for a month long sidetrack to the over all mission.  The Shadow almost guarantees there will be no rails to your game, and as soon as there are, they will attempt to derail it.  It calls for inventive use, brave storytelling, fearless approaches to how to play both Character and Shadow, and a maturity that people should invest in all gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd whispering in your neighbor's ear about how they are doing everything wrong and should surrender to ultimate death is creepy as hell. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298489/#Comment_298489" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T12:44:10+00:00" title="October 27, 2010 12:44PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish somebody would make a "Wraithlike" game that had the basic concept, the Shadows, and none of the metaplotty stuff.

Every Shadowguide was more like a GM Minion, who added complications of self beyond plot, but there wasn't a reward for doing so.  There was only suffering brought on by the players around the table onto the other players.
