To say it was painful and frustrating for me would be an understatement.<br/><br/>But I'd like to break things down here and ask some questions, in the hope that folks can jump in and help for our next session.<br/><br/>The game started out fine. Character generation was pretty fun, although pretty uneventful for me as MC. <br/>-No one knew what 'oddments' were (a short note in the rules would help here).  <br/>-It was fun to help create gear using a Toybox.<br/>-Tags for creating weapons and other things are interesting. I feel like we need more opportunities to use this.<br/>-There was confusing about whether a 'gang' consisted of NPCs or of other players.<br/>-We had a good time going around the table and describing characters. I took a lot of color notes for later from this.<br/><br/>Hx was not very fun. I had previously read the rules as written and not understood them. So I decided to use the Hx rules that were written on the new playbook (I just found these the morning of, so we used the original playbooks for chargen).<br/>-Calculating Hx for five players is pretty frustrating and I'm sure we got some values wrong.<br/>-Most of the values ended up being in the negative, which had unforeseen consequences later.<br/>-Having values "increase" from +4 to +1 or from -4 to -1 was very nonintuitive.<br/><br/>Highlighting stats was also frustrating.<br/>-The Hx values seemed so off that I decided to let the other players agree on a highlighted stat for each character. And then I added one in of my own.<br/>-There was confusion about whether the player should announce all of their stats first before we highlighted one, or keep it a secret.<br/><br/>Then we progressed to building the world. The bolded bullet points at the bottom of pg. 26 are actually pretty helpful. I wish these would have been on the 1st session worksheet (which probably needs to be two pages).<br/><br/>I asked a lot of questions, I had the characters put themselves into everyday situations ("what do you do when you get this morning?"). I took note of the NPCs which came up. We gave them names and "jobs", although for the latter I had to ignore the threat types to keep my pencil writing fast enough. I also wrote down a handful of questions to use for later. Having players add locations to the map and describing them was fun.<br/><br/>But after awhile of this, it seemed (to me) like the table energy was slowing down. In retrospect, it would probably have been a better move for me to "Look for where they're not in control" and "Lead forward with named, human NPCs".<br/><br/>Instead I decided to take the advice of "Hell, have a fight." The Driver character had described coming back from a run in another town carrying someone's girl in his car. The cargo was the condoms filled with radioactive material that she had swallowed, cocaine-mule-style. Cool, right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260229/#Comment_260229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T11:02:06+00:00" title="March  5, 2010 11:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Part 2]<br/><br/>So I decided to have the Driver (Marlene) in sight of his hometown, but with some bikers chasing him down for his cargo. In retrospect, it sounds like we should have first established *who* these bikers were and *why* they were chasing him. But honestly, I thought it would be a five minute scene, we would have gotten to test out chasing and/or combat, and then we'd be back to establishing character and situation. Wrong:)<br/><br/>Marlene decides to take a shortcut through 'Hell' (an old battlefield ripe with rusted out grip and unexploded landmines) in hopes that the bikers wouldn't follow.<br/><br/>I have the player roll + cool. On a 10, you lose them. On a 7-9, there is some compromise. He rolls a 4. Oops.<br/><br/>So based on the rules, on a Miss I'm supposed to have something pretty bad happen. So I say that Marlene hits a landmine with her right front tire, and the car spins out of control and flips several times. Marlene takes 3 Harm (a 4 Harm explosion - 1 Armor from the car), and the girl is laying next to her in a bloody, dying heap. As Marlene regains consciousness, she can hear the bikers revving their engines.<br/><br/>To cut a long combat short, Marlene tries to Get the Fuck Down in her battered car while the bikers are riding up to her. Barbarossa (the Gunlugger) was nearby and tries to drag Marlene out of the car and to safety. Marlene fails and Barbarossa succeeds, so the latter drags Marlene off the road and into a culvert that is too steep for the bikers to ride into.<br/><br/>The three bikers get to the car, drag the girl's body out and throw it over one of their bike saddles, while pulling out weapons and starting to beat the hell out of Marlene's car. Marlene tries to hide (gets a partial success, so maybe she thinks she's hidden but really isn't?) and Barbarossa pops up to shoot one of the bikers dead.<br/><br/>Then the other two bikers try to attack Marlene and Barbarossa, and when the latter rolls a Miss, the gang leader Hugo wraps his chain around Barbarossa's neck and starts to drag him back up to the road. But the gunlugger's 2 armor keeps him from being damaged by the 2 Harm chain.<br/><br/>At some point the second biker gets killed, so now it's Marlene alternatively trying to hide and pop shots off with her 9mm, while Hugo drags Barbarossa up to him and puts a sawed-off shotgun to his head (which was the only way I could think of to get past Barbarossa's 2 Armor). Marlene surrenders and comes out of hiding. Nero had been out riding his horse and watching the action, hoping to get some easy scrap after it was over. But when he saw Barbarossa about to get killed, he used a mirror to reflect the sun into Hugo's eyes. Which distracted Hugo long enough for Barbarossa to reach up and cockpunch him, Ow.<br/><br/>The characters decided to leave Hugo alive, but to strip him naked and force him to ride back to his gang naked on the crappiest of the three bikes. With bruised balls.<br/><br/>At that point we were about out of time. So I decided to end the session. We spent a good 10-15 minutes talking about what we liked and didn't like, what was confusing and what we wanted to see more of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260230/#Comment_260230" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T11:02:26+00:00" title="March  5, 2010 11:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Part 3]<br/><br/>Here are some questions/concerns/editing notes we had, mostly from the players.<br/><br/>1. Rolling 7-9 seems nebulous. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. 10+ seems like the only good result.<br/><br/>2.

They just get it with some complications added on.  More to the point, the MC doesn't get to make a move in response, because they didn't miss.<br/><br/>I made the same sort of mistake in our early sessions, laying out a lot of Harm inadvertently and making the players gun-shy.  The first session guidelines suggest keeping the fights small- a few individuals, no gangs- but it might be worth adding "no weapons above 2 Harm".<br/><br/>I agree about the "end of every session" Hx adjustment- that's not really a Move, so much as a procedure of play.<br/><br/>Thanks for writing this up Chris!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260245/#Comment_260245" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T11:52:56+00:00" title="March  5, 2010 11:52AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just throwing out a few thoughts as I go.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>a.There was confusing about whether a 'gang' consisted of NPCs or of other players.<br/>---------------------------------<br/>b.Having values "increase" from +4 to +1 or from -4 to -1 was very nonintuitive.<br/>---------------------------------<br/>c.There was confusion about whether the player should announce all of their stats first before we highlighted one, or keep it a secret.<br/>---------------------------------<br/>d.

Does that make it less nebolous?<br/><br/>2. That does seem like a concern. I suppose why it's always great to have an Angel in the game.<br/><br/>3. It's a pacing mechanism, although it's certainly kinda meta-fictional.<br/><br/>4. Are you shooting him in the face? Then it's probably hard, going aggro. Are you shooting him from afar, or in some chaotic situation? Then it's probably acting under fire. I'm not 100% on this myself.<br/><br/>5. 7-9 is not really a "whiff", but I understand the problem.

For those moves that put it in your hands, you should make a hit on a 7-9 an imperfect success, not a failure.

However, the resulting fiction seems pretty awesome, actually.<br/><br/>My current game of Apocalypse World (soon to come out of hibernation) has been a combination of frustration and awesome. As Vincent has been revising the game, the points of frustration have been waning and the awesome has been increasing. So, take heart! Some of your issues are probably due to the playtestingness of the current game.<br/><br/>Also, it helps to adjust one's thinking on moves. A move isn't "conflict resolution". It's actually "task resolution". So, a dice roll doesn't resolve the situation; it just resolves the particular action that is being attempted. In other words, it is <i>totally cool</i> for a PC to attempt a move, fail, and then make the same move again. Now, sure, the context has changed, since the MC got to make a move in the interim. But who says that the MC's move has to be the worst thing possible? So you're trying to sneak up on Tum Tum. You roll to act under fire and fail. So now the MC's move is that Tum Tum sees you and points his gun at you (putting you "in a spot"). Now what are you going to do? Draw your gun and get him to back off? Great! That's going aggro. Though, you realize that failing this means that he's probably going to shoot you, right? Great! Go ahead and roll....<br/><br/>In addition, I have some thoughts on some of your thoughts. Hope this helps.\n<blockquote>1. Rolling 7-9 seems nebulous. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. 10+ seems like the only good result.</blockquote>\nYes. Well, no. As Steve says, 7-9 is always supposed to be kinda good with a price tag.\n<blockquote>2. Marlene took 3 Harm early on in the scene, and the player felt constrained to do only things that would keep her alive. Rather than staying involved in the scene.</blockquote>\nSerious question because I wasn't there: how is trying to survive not staying involved in that scene? The gritty violence of the setting almost demands this sort of approach to combat. This isn't a game where you take a couple of hits and then keep going. The fact that PCs have 6harm worth of damage <i>is</i> their plot immunity, since NPCs essentially have only 3harm worth of damage. Is this a matter of incorrect assumptions about the sort of fiction the game will produce?<br/><br/>Hopefully that doesn't come off as snark.\n<blockquote>3. The countdown ticks for battles and harm felt gimmicky. Much like the PTGS in Burning Wheel. In play we found it to be pretty clunky. Why is the battle over when you hit midnight? </blockquote>\nYeah, this bit is a little unclear. I wonder if it's helpful to think about a "battle" as something akin to a combat round in Champions, where you can do a couple things, instead of just one. So, what we would think of as a "combat scene" might be composed of several "battles".<br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing more from Vincent about this, because, as I'm thinking about it, the battle rules and countdown weren't intuitive for me either.\n<blockquote>4. The list of Basic Moves seemed restrictive. "I shoot him". What move is that? Players wondered whether this was the comprehensive list of Basic Moves. Also we wished the Basic Moves were organized better. Perhaps put into buckets of "attacking", "moving", etc.</blockquote>\n"I shoot him" is seizing something by force (i.e. his life). This is different than "I stick my gun in his face" which is generally an invitation to comply with the gun wielder's desires and is therefore going aggro. Also, as far as inflicted harm goes, I believe it's possible for the MC to say, "Yeah, and because you're shooting him and he only has a crowbar, his base harm to you is zero." Again, I'd want to hear from Vincent on this.<br/><br/>That being said, this particular action has caused confusion in our group, too. So, I think it's something that would be helpful if it were explained in the rulebook.\n<blockquote>5. The PCs actions felt dynamic, but the NPCs lack of action rolls meant that they felt static. Because only the PCs roll, it made the 7-9 "whiff factor" even more annoying to some players.</blockquote>\nYeah, you'll want to get the players to see 7-9 as a partial success, not a failure. That will help with this problem, I think.\n<blockquote>6. Our first combat was LONG. I bet we spent 45 minutes on it, with the other players literally twiddling their thumbs.</blockquote>\nWas this just fumbling with the system that will be improved with experience and/or better organizational tools? Or is it something else?<br/><br/>Also, for what it's worth, I don't use the battle moves. They don't speak to me. (Oddly, though, the new barter moves that Vincent put together on the playtest blog should be really, really helpful for my group. Go figger.)\n<blockquote>7. The gunlugger combination of 2 Armor and "Not to be Fucked With" (act as a 3 Harm Small Gang) seems pretty powerful.</blockquote>\nWe don't have a gunlugger in our group, so I can't speak to this. However, this does strike me as being all kinds of awesome. Especially, consider the action that Hugo had to take to get to the point of bypassing that armor. Good stuff.\n<blockquote>8.

The most obvious answer escapes them because they're gamers.<br/><br/>"I shoot him" isn't, in and of itself, a move, right? So you don't roll. You're there, Tum Tum's there, you have your shotgun leveled. "I blast him with my shotgun. 2-harm," and done is done, easy-peasy. The GM is looking at Tum Tum through crosshairs, so fuck that guy. Of course you blast him and good riddance.<br/><br/>But then, why are you in a position to just blast Tum Tum with a shotgun? That's where the moves might come in.<br/><br/>If you both have your guns out and the fight is on, then you're seizing something by force. Their life, their gear, their dignity, something. You shoot, they shoot. You do harm to each other according to your weapons and armor and the specific circumstances, modified by how your roll goes and what items you choose.<br/><br/>If you're shooting Tum Tum in the leg in order to get his gang to back down, you're going aggro and you roll that move.<br/><br/>If you're running from cover to cover while the gang shoots at you so you can get up behind Tum Tum and blast him in the back of the head, then you're acting under fire and you roll that move.<br/><br/>If none of those... then you just shoot him. Sometimes life works out that way. Enjoy it while you can.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World doesn't work right if you play like this: "Okay, so your character is taking action... which move should we make you roll to get that done?" No.<br/><br/>If you do something covered by a move, you roll the move (<i>if you do it, you do it</i>). If you want to get the effects of a move's roll, you have to also do it in the fiction (<i>to do it, do it</i>). Those are the only rules around rolling dice. That means -- yes it really does mean this -- if you do something that the moves don't cover then you just do it. "I climb the radio tower." If you're not under fire, then yeah, you climb the damn radio tower. I don't care how challenging a climb it would be. There's no "When you undertake a treacherous climb" move, so you don't roll.<br/><br/>Also, what Seth said about conflicts and tasks. AW (like Poison'd) is all action and consequences.<br/><br/>Also, 5 PLAYERS IS WAY TOO MANY. I can't say this loud enough or often enough.

Moves have mechanical weight, right?  But so does the fiction because there's fictional positioning.  If I shoot some guy in the face, he's dead.  And that creates fictional consequences that might be bad for me, mechanically (his buddies come and do me Harm), but there's no mechanics involved in shooting him.

The most obvious answer escapes them because they're gamers.<br/><br/>"I shoot him" isn't, in and of itself, a move, right? So you don't roll. You're there, Tum Tum's there, you have your shotgun leveled. "I blast him with my shotgun. 2-harm," and done is done, easy-peasy. The GM is looking at Tum Tum through crosshairs, so fuck that guy. Of course you blast him and good riddance.<br/><br/>But then, why are you in a position to just blast Tum Tum with a shotgun? That's where the moves might come in.<br/><br/>If you both have your guns out and the fight is on, then you're seizing something by force. Their life, their gear, their dignity, something. You shoot, they shoot. You do harm to each other according to your weapons and armor and the specific circumstances, modified by how your roll goes and what items you choose.<br/><br/>If you're shooting Tum Tum in the leg in order to get his gang to back down, you're going aggro and you roll that move.<br/><br/>If you're running from cover to cover while the gang shoots at you so you can get up behind Tum Tum and blast him in the back of the head, then you're acting under fire and you roll that move.<br/><br/>If none of those... then you just shoot him. Sometimes life works out that way. Enjoy it while you can.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World doesn't work right if you play like this: "Okay, so your character is taking action... which move should we make you roll to get that done?" No.<br/><br/>If you do something covered by a move, you roll the move (<i>if you do it, you do it</i>). If you want to get the effects of a move's roll, you have to also do it in the fiction (<i>to do it, do it</i>). Those are the only rules around rolling dice. That means -- yes it really does mean this -- if you do something that the moves don't cover then you just do it. "I climb the radio tower." If you're not under fire, then yeah, you climb the damn radio tower. I don't care how challenging a climb it would be. There's no "When you undertake a treacherous climb" move, so you don't roll.<br/><br/>Also, what Seth said about conflicts and tasks. AW (like Poison'd) is all action and consequences.<br/><br/>Also, 5 PLAYERS IS WAY TOO MANY. I can't say this loud enough or often enough. Just... don't.</blockquote>\nThank you for laying this out, John. You obviously get the game in a way I just don't.<br/><br/>Is all of this in the rules and I just missed it?

This isn't as complicated as it looks.<br/><br/>Everything can be kept simple by giving everyone a turn to do something and then resolve it in the fiction (this could be by rolling a move or just figuring out what the logical consequences are).

This is gonna be quick and dirty and you might want to have the moves open in front of you for reference.<br/><br/>There are no opposed rolls. Like Dylan says, interfering with a roll+Hx is as close as it gets.<br/><br/><b>Example 1, Marie vs Hugo.</b><br/>Marie is seizing by force. You can tell she's seizing by force because <i>both</i> she wants something and Hugo is fighting back.<br/>She rolls a 10+: she chooses 3. Odds are that she inflicts 4-harm on him - lethal! - and he inflicts 2-harm on her. The third is probably irrelevant.<br/>She rolls a 7-9: she chooses 2. Again, I bet she chooses to inflict 4-harm on him and suffer only 2-harm herself.<br/>She misses the roll: your move. An obvious one is "trade harm for harm," in which case they each inflict 3-harm upon the other.<br/><br/><b>Example 2, Marlene vs Barbossa vs NPC Bikers.</b><br/>Marlene is getting the fuck down, Barbossa is helping or interfering (as presented, interfering).<br/>He rolls a hit, 10+ or 7-9: she gets -2 to her roll.<br/>He rolls a 7-9: he additionally exposes himself to fire, danger, retribution or cost (in this case, fire).<br/>He misses the roll: she gets no modifier, your move. An obvious one is "inflict harm," in which case he takes fire from the gang. If they're (2-harm small), he takes 3-harm.<br/><br/>Marlene rolls a 10+ (after the -2, if applicable): she's in a good spot; she comes under no fire for the rest of the battle (until 12:00 on the countdown).<br/>She rolls a 7-9 (after the -2, if applicable): she comes under only incidental fire (0-harm and 1-harm) for the rest of the battle.<br/>She misses the roll: your move, provided by her move's description: she has to break position now or come under concentrated fire (again, probably 3-harm). If she breaks position, to join him in the ditch, say, clearly she's doing it under fire and should roll for that move.<br/><br/>If Marlene manages to stay down, but Barbossa persists in trying to drag her out, he's both acting under fire and seizing by force (presuming she resists), so he should roll the former first and the latter if the former lets him. When he makes that roll to seize her by force, establish what weapons they're using on each other, to establish how much harm they'll each suffer. His weapon is "dragging," which is 0-harm; she might be shooting him, it's up to her.<br/><br/><b>Example 3, Hugo vs Barbossa vs Marlene</b><br/>Barbossa's acting under fire. He has to get Hugo off of him before Hugo blows his head open, right?<br/>He rolls a 10+: he does it. He cock-punches Hugo, Hugo fires his shotgun off centimeters from Barbossa's head, they're fighting again.<br/>He rolls a 7-9: he does it, but something. He cock-punches Hugo, Hugo fires his shotgun off, Barbossa's (temporarily) blinded and head-ringing from the blast.<br/>He misses: your move. An obvious one is "inflict harm," in which case Hugo hits Barbossa for 3-harm ap, which won't kill him (unless he's been shot in earlier fighting too). He cock-punches Hugo, which throws Hugo off enough to lay open the side of his head instead of blowing it off, and they're fighting again.<br/><br/>No matter which of these happens, if Marlene seizes the opportunity and shoots Hugo, she's seizing by force (if Hugo will shoot back at her) or else going aggro (if he can't or won't, like if he's still intent upon Barbossa). Furthermore, Barbossa's actions can count as Barbossa helping Marlene by distracting Hugo, so Barbossa can roll+Hx to give her a +1.<br/><br/>Followup questions, bring 'em. I have read-only access to Story Games at work, so I may answer by email.<br/><br/>Thanks for this! You've pointed out to me a paragraph or two I need to add to the MC book, about "his weapon is 'dragging,' which is 0-harm."<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260672/#Comment_260672" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T09:14:59+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  9:14AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks Vincent.

It's like you're trying to figure out what the rules for rolling are, using the basic moves as examples to learn from. They aren't! They <i>are</i> the rules for rolling.<br/><br/>In other words, don't take the character's action and try to figure out what will happen on a 10+, what on a 7-9, and what on a miss. Instead, take the character's action and figure out which move it is. <br/><br/>Does this make sense? Have I misread you?<br/><br/>Oh, and for the record, I'm running the game for 5 players right now and it's not terrible. If I were just starting out with the game, I'd want a smaller group. We do have some screentime troubles, but for the most part the players pay close and active attention to the scenes they aren't in. The PC-NPC-PC triangles help, and so does the way that action <i>here</i> always somehow becomes trouble <i>there</i>.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260903/#Comment_260903" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:40:49+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:40AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How long are your sessions with those five people, Vincent? <br/><br/>I ask because ours are 2 hours long, and that's not enough.
