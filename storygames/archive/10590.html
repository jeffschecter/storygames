Thought I'd share them. They are all based on the nameless characters who the "heroes" slaughter en masse. <br/><br/><b>Expendable</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Find your favorite action film</li>\n<li>Skip to the best fight sequence</li>\n<li>Watch it, paying close attention to the least consequential death that occurs</li>\n<li>That person is your "character"</li>\n<li>The rest of the game is discovering who that character is, where he came from, and what events led up to his death</li>\n</ol>\nThis could be done in a number of ways, and I didn't ever figure out what way I preferred. \n<ul>\n<li>You could have a character sheet and you need to fill in each of the parts of the sheet through narrating scenes that explain his background.</li>\n<li>You could work backwards from what you know about the character (he has a gun and works for the bad guys) using some type of guided scene narration rules</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Expendable (Option 2)</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Find your favorite action film (preferably a film where the protagonist is part of a squad or group, ie. not Rambo)</li>\n<li>Choose a minor character from the good guys (an expendable crew member, or a minor protagonist) that dies.</li>\n<li>Play out the last adventure (or short campaign) that this character was in before the film happened.</li>\n</ol>\nI haven't worked out how this is done. I like the idea  because of two unchangeable facts 1) Your character will not progress because in his next adventure he will die, and 2) He will survive the current adventure because we know that he is in the next one. Both of these things could be encouraging to a player to create some interesting scenes and inject some personality into the character. (Or maybe not).<br/><br/><b>Expendable (Option 3)</b><br/><br/>This one is the least developed.<br/><br/>A game where the players collectively play a single "hero" who is killing the "bad guys" or maybe vice versa, they collectively play the "bad guys" being slaughtered by the "hero." <br/><br/>The objective of the expendable bad guys is to become a fully developed character (an individual) before getting killed by the hero. If a bad guy becomes fully developed then they can assert a connection between them and the hero, forcing the hero to see them as a person rather than a nameless bad guy ("Oh yeah! Didn't I wrestle you back in high school?") This would either immediately or eventually give the hero a new-found respect for life and prevent him from killing any further.<br/><br/>The objective of the hero is to stay detached from the people he's killing and complete the mission.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234982/#Comment_234982" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T06:23:01+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  6:23AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the first one the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
