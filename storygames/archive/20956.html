I wanted to go in a more realistic direction - is there a game that focuses on the CIA and their more unique problem solving efforts? Cracking deals with terrorists, smuggling weapons, starting revolutions. Any ideas on what a good system for that would be?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459867/#Comment_459867" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-03T21:38:34+00:00" title="February  3, 2017  9:38PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about Ron Edward's <i>Spione</i>? It's a tight and focused RPG about real espionage (although in a specific locale and timeframe), or at least about the more realistic kind of spy fiction (including works by former spies and spymasters), and the CIA is a prominent player in the Berlin spy game. Even if that doesn't end up being the exact game you wish to play, it looks like a good starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
