Also, something to do with manipulating the forces of the fall (whether that is a ult to the comet that brought it about or radiation powers or something). Something to give a bonus to ambush, something to give a bonus to spot ambush, Fitting in in foreign "cultures." Remember with the break down of communication and travel each region gets smaller and regional customs become more divergent. So, secrets about communication and travel are good as well. I hesitate to suggest language, but maybe something to do with the pre-fall languages might be a good secret.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408029/#Comment_408029" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T14:18:30+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  2:18PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that detects the dangers left behind.

The games are methodologically very similar, so you'll find that many of the ideas from AW will translate directly. Moves become Secrets, character classes become Keys and so on.<br/><br/>WIth a campaign starting from scratch, I'd either make the Keys with the players (essentially asking them what they want the game to be about), or I'd prep just 2-3 "core" Keys and ~1 Key per "character concept" or setting topic (think of how the individual cultures in TSoY also introduce a couple of Keys related to their theming). This would probably be less work and provide a more focused Keying environment than going through the entire genre analytically in advance and making a long list of Keys.<br/><br/>The aforementioned Apocalypse World is actually a good example of how creative focus works in setting-building: it's a postapocalyptic game, but it doesn't attempt to be a generic postapocalyptic game. It's actually pretty focused thematically on the general level. If I were translating the AW setting into Solar System, I might have just two or three "core" Keys: the setting is about the past being a forgotten and unknown territory, about the postmodern fracture of civilization, and about sexuality as a social force that builds up new human society in the void. On top of these "general" Keys I'd then provide whatever individual character concepts imply. At no point would I go into a long dissection of postapocalyptic fiction in general.<br/><br/>To say the same thing in simpler terms: first select your focal point (as per the 1st chapter of Solar System), then start developing your crunch. What is the interesting and specific thing about your setting, the thing you tell the players about before character creation? Will the game be set on the Pacific Ocean, where everybody lives on boats and oil platforms? Will it be about the last functioning nuclear power plant on the continent? A random bunch of strangers forced together by the circumstances? Something like that, a focal point the players can relate their characters to.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408088/#Comment_408088" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T01:27:25+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  1:27AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 1:27AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, it was actually difficult for me to respond to your post.  I wrote one and deleted it, then went and reread the Story Guide section of the rules and went and read the MCing sections of AW.  The only conclusion I can come to is that I'm going to be intentionally running Solar System wrong, because I'm not going to be doing anything like the methodology of Apocalypse World.  We ended up picking Solar System over AW specifically because of the fundamental differences we saw after reading the TSoY texts available online.<br/><br/>We'll have to figure out the three or so core Keys for our own focal point.  I'm sure the various people at the table will have different favorite post apocalyptic movies and books, so we will be incorporating all sorts of elements.  In terms of "getting it right," <i>it</i> will not be defined as a particular pre-packaged setting like Apocalypse World, or Fallout, or Roadwarior, or Omega Man.  It's going to be some sort of synthesis of a elements from variety of sources.  Doing anything other than taking a more inclusive approach to the whole genre means no game will happen.<br/><br/>From here I'm probably going to start making some concept keys (like the Road Hog one above).  I'm getting the sense that these should be motif keys rather than motivation ones.  Also, given that the development of the focal point and crunch being custom made as we go, I think the most important thing is to get comfortable with the process of making the crunch.  So I may not even bring the stuff I come up with to the session.<br/><br/>The last time I made Keys it was for a Vampire game where you lost your human keys over time and replaced them with keys for the supernatural victimization of mortals and other vampires until eventually the only way you could get XP was to go after the other player's and the mortals they care about.  The keys were on cards that you drew at specific times to see how the beast within was manifesting.  I made them all in advance and didn't have to make any custom ones during the game itself.  And all the human keys were simply taken directly from TSoY.  So this approach of making custom ones on demand is new for me, but I think it'll be fine.  I'm not the only person at the table as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408098/#Comment_408098" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T04:26:34+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  4:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested in hearing more about the differences between TSoY and AW, and about how you're planning to structure the campaign. I do definitely agree that the Solar System paradigm has room for variety. Specifically, much of what I write about SS in the booklet should be considered descriptive of my own practices, not prescriptive of how the game needs to be construed.<br/><br/>Regarding Key-making, usually most Keys developed by the SG are 1/2/5 type. There's no particular prescription for this, but my experience tends to be that individual characters have 1-2 motivation Keys, while the rest are of the other type. This is largely due to how dramatic characterization works.<br/><br/>Creating the Crunch at the table works pretty well in my experience. The outcome is usually pretty straightforward, but it can be deepened by work in between sessions, and full-body revisions at later stages if the campaign proves lengthy. Also, if you freeze in crunch development, there's no reason not to note in play that this character's due a "Key of Roadhogging", and then develop the details for the next session. It's not a crime or flaw to take your time to think about things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408107/#Comment_408107" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T05:59:27+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  5:59AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 6:08AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all we have stake setting vs moves and predefined 7-9,10+ list based resolution.

You roll your dice and get either a 6 or less, a 7-9 or a 10+ and then apply some or all of the results found on a list.<br/><br/>Then there's variable scene framing in Solar System and "what do you do?" based MC description in Apocalypse World.  The rules text of Apocalypse World says interestingly little about scenes and instead advocates a more traditional "what do you do?" based way of doing things.  I see TSoY and Solar System as "Oh no you fucking don't" games while AW is a "what do you do?" game.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World has a singular emphasis on actor stance.  Take the MC principle of always addressing the characters and not the players, for example.  Whereas stake setting and the general character advocate approach makes Solar System have a wider scope for the players.  Solar System seems to encourage being the audience and advocate for your own character rather than just sticking with actor stance.<br/><br/>Then there's the "Make your move, but never speak its name" principle in Apocalypse World where the system option (move) the MC is choosing is intentionally not referred to by its name.  In Solar System if a participant calls for a task related ability check or a conflict results or a conflict is escalated and extended, you want to be explicit about exactly what you are doing.  I think this is related to the desire to facilitate the players being in actor stance, while Solar System supports a wider character advocacy position.<br/><br/>The misdirection advice where the MC makes a decision based on real world stuff (cues and participants to use Vincent's blog terms) but then pretends to be making it based on fictional purposes (clouds) strikes me as a bit strange compared to Solar System where you can be far more up front and explicit in terms of the motivation for a given choice.  Again, this probably has to do with the commitment to actor stance as drawing attention to decision making unrelated to the fiction can hamper that.  The text really emphasis a commitment to making Apocalypse World real to the players.<br/><br/>Also, compare AW play books with Solar System character creation.  The difference is pretty incredible in terms of combinations and customization vs what are pretty much traditional classes.  Solar System seems to be a lot more about players choosing what interests them in the moment and the transition of one interest to another as characters lose and gain keys, while AW playbooks are very specific and largely preset.  Another person that I'll be playing with has played AW and said the experience reminded them of pre-gens that you rename and adjust a little.  I get what they are saying, even if I think they're over stating the case a bit by comparing the playbooks to pregens.  I think they're far more like traditional character classes.<br/><br/>Basically I see AW as being very specific in its support of a single approach to play while Solar System is a lot more open and flexible.  I see the lists inside of Moves (and the lists of Moves themselves) as preselected options according to what you call "leverage, propriety and scope."  Apocalypse World is actually very supportive of traditional RPG play, but with an emphasis on participant positioning while Solar System's scene framing, conflict resolution, stake setting and character advocacy are supportive of less traditional play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408108/#Comment_408108" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T06:04:00+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  6:04AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Regarding Key-making, usually most Keys developed by the SG are 1/2/5 type.

The outcome is usually pretty straightforward, but it can be deepened by work in between sessions, and full-body revisions at later stages if the campaign proves lengthy.

I haven't played Apocalypse World myself, largely because it seems so similar to TSoY that it hasn't hooked anybody around here sufficiently yet. My reading of it was less relentlessly in-character, but I do agree that the text represents itself more from the viewpoint of GM responsibility (and therefore the capability of obfuscating system interfacing to the fiction), while the TSoY textual tradition tends to be more about open an egalitarian application of common principles. I'm sure that if I GMed Apocalypse World, I'd end up explaining to the other players why and what I was doing from moment to moment just to maintain joint commitment to systemic principles.<br/><br/>Regarding playbooks, TSoY sort of did that thing first with the cultural origin thing it has going. AW formalizes the character classes a bit by making it an explicit rule that you can't take crunch from another character class, while in TSoY the usual way to play it has always been that you're limited by your culture/niche/concept in character creation, while in play you'll get whatever new stuff the fiction dictates. Of course Solar System in general doesn't really care one way or another, it depends on the campaign concept whether it makes sense to cordon the available crunch into character classes or not. I've never started a campaign from scratch and ended up with very strong character class elements - at most it's stuff like "only people born on planet X may learn to use Ability Y", which isn't very impressive insofar as character classes go.<br/><br/>Your overall conclusion might well be pretty on the mark, too: AW encourages focusing on the fictional positioning as a primary issue, while the procedure in Solar System (at least the way I understand it) is more top-down: you play around, recognize some potential conflicts, and then establish fictional positioning to support and define that conflict. The selection of Abilities for conflict, activating Secrets and so on mostly matters as a way to dig down into concrete "how do you contest this matter, exactly" territory. AW requires players to focus on the concrete details from the start, in comparison. Thinking about it, this is probably a primary reason for why SS has a skill system while AW doesn't - AW doesn't need that digging tool for determining events from abstract conflicts of interest because it requires players to stay on the bottom all the time.

Every group has their sticky issues and character classes might be one of ours.  I think half the people don't care and the other half don't like it.  So when a subset of our larger gaming circle sits down to play, the odds are something really class-like is going to be a non-starter.  Solar System's open ended or class-free approach suits us far better than AW's playbooks.<br/><br/>One thing I've learned about Vincent Baker's games is that he means what he says in the rules, especially in the sections that might be called "GM advice" in other RPGs.  It's not advice.  It's the process the MC is actually supposed to go through and in AW, it definitely includes an approach that is far more relentlessly in-character.  The very first of the three agendas for the game is to make Apocalypse World real.  And the principle list includes the idea of addressing characters and never players.  And he specifically says to use the words "What do you do?".  Like literally say that <i>every time</i> you do an MC move.<br/><br/>I prefer the top-down egalitarian approach to the relentlessly in-character "what do you do?" approach.  And I love the digging down process where we figure out exactly what is at stake and how it's going to get resolved.  The free and clear back and forth is often where you find out exactly what the people at the table care about in the conflict (at least that's what I found when playing Sorcerer).  I may be wrong about it, but it also looks like going defensive and changing stakes in an extended/escalated conflict is going to be another source of finding out exactly what's important to people.  As well as when people choose to quit an extended conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408138/#Comment_408138" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T10:11:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2013 10:11AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 10:13AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting discussion here. I have a few thoughts which jump out at me:<br/><br/>1. Apocalypse World playbooks are not really like character classes. Why not? There are a number of differences:<br/><br/>* There's only one of each "type" in the world. You're not one of many, you're *the* one. It's much more of an archetype or story role than a class (in the sense of "this is what I do"). By choosing that playbook, you select an archetype and then you tell us how that archetype relates to the world or the story. ("This is what the Hardholder should be in this story. This is what I find challenging about the role of authority and the use of power.")<br/><br/>* The playbooks are as much about "what kind of trouble should I expect?" as "what can I do/what are my strengths?". If a Hardholder is in play, we know to expect question of authority, mutinies, famines, war, and internal strife. If a Touchstone is in play, we're exploring the nature of hope and how it can spread from a single source outwards through society.<br/><br/>* The playbooks give a starting point but do not say anything about future potential. There is no "path" laid out for you when you choose a playbook. You could go in any direction from there. More importantly, you *have* to significantly change direction, because pretty soon you will run out of improvement options and have to either retire the character or switch to another class.<br/><br/>* Character development comes largely from the playbook switch. The character starts out a certain way, and is then transformed in the course of the story to become someone else. In Solar System, Keys are bought off and new Keys purchased. In AW, the carefree Battlebabe accepts responsibility and becomes the Hardholder, wielding power for the needs of others instead for her own desires. The Angel, devoting his life to saving people's lives, snaps and becomes the Gunlugger, only interested in retribution.<br/><br/>This aspect is not immediately apparent when you read through the rules, but when you start playing, from the first few advances you'll see how much taking new moves can transform the characters (and should, I think). Consider how much it says about your Angel if you take the move "merciless" with your first advance. What if you take "frenzy", instead? ("When you speak the truth to a crowd...") It really pushes the character in different directions.<br/><br/>It feels very different from "classes" in practice. A starting point, kind of like a pre-generated character role ("You're the captain of the ship, you're in charge; you're the person people go to for support; you're the one nobody trusts;" etc). But from the moment you choose your starting moves, your character's off in his or her own personal direction.<br/><br/>2. I agree that there a huge advantages to a more "top-down" approach to conflict and story construction: when I play AW, I often really miss explicit conflict resolution. Free-and-clear stakes negotiation allows us to come to consensus on what's happening in much greater clarity. I think this is an important point, because in the last couple of years it's been very fashionable in these circles to look down on formal "stakes" and formalized conflict, probably because designers are exploring other methods for handling conflict in play.<br/><br/>3. The way we're discussing Keys here (and the way they are discussed in Solar System) often makes me think that there is a little bit of confusion about Creative Agenda-related issues. I'd love to hear from Eero whether this is something intentional on his part (when writing Solar System), a distinction between the roles of the two types of Keys, or something I'm imagining.<br/><br/>Clinton's Keys (from TSoY) strongly suggest a Narrativist approach to me: the various options suggest difficult moral choices for the protagonist. For example:\n<blockquote>Key of Faith<br/>Your character has a strong religious belief that guides her. Gain 1 XP every time she defends her faith to others. Gain 2 XP whenever this character converts someone to her faith. Gain 5 XP whenever this character defends her faith even though it brings her great harm. Buyoff: Your character renounces her beliefs.</blockquote>\nEven without looking at the buyoff, it seems pretty clear that this Key is all about a question of value: "How far will you go to defend your faith?"<br/><br/>Here's one of Jason's:\n<blockquote>Key of the Follower<br/><br/>You're a natural or disciplined follower, and easily fall in line behind whoever the leader with the most authority might be. 1xp for doing what you're told and backing up the boss; 2xp for following orders even when they seem questionable; 5xp for following orders that cause you harm. Buyoff: refuse to follow orders</blockquote>\nSimilarly, this Key challenges the character, encouraging the player to get deeper into trouble (since you get more rewards when you're in conflict with the authority's wishes).<br/><br/>However, the focus of some Keys in the Solar System booklet are more tied to in-fiction motives ("Talk about vampires, interact with vampires..."). This seems to be what's being discussed in this thread, as well:\n<blockquote>So on Friday we have our first session of our post apocalyptic game using Solar System. [...]<br/><br/>First thing I thought I'd do is brain storm elements of post apocalyptic play that people might want keys for:<br/><br/>[...]<br/>historic knowledge<br/>raiding<br/>fighting from moving vehicles<br/>[...]<br/><br/>I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out which things are motivation based keys and which are not.<br/><br/>Anyone have any thoughts so far?</blockquote>\nTo me, things like "fighting from moving vehicles" are not really material for Keys, which I see as points of dramatic focus and character values. But clearly some people use them this way, and the Solar System booklet suggests that this is a good way to go.<br/><br/>Is this a Narrativism/Simulationism thing? ("Here, get some XP for showing us one more time what you said you would want to see your character doing on-screen.") Or is there some other reason why this type of Key is important? <br/><br/>Who knows, maybe this hypothetical dichotomy I'm building up is just in my head. I can certainly see Keys which cross that imaginary line with ease.<br/><br/><br/>[Sidenote: My apologies to anyone who's reading this and is GNS-allergic. I'm discussing it this way because I think Eero, the author of Solar System, responds well to this kind of dialogue. In my experience, this is a fruitful way of engaging him. If you don't like or understand the Big Model, hopefully you can understand what I'm trying to say anyway.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408186/#Comment_408186" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T16:29:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  4:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2013 5:08PM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts on point 1:  Don't really have a dog in the race in terms of how much they are like classes.  Thought I did, but when I give it more thought, I think I'm happy with my point about the focused nature of AW playbooks and the wide open nature of Solar System character creation being what I have to say about it.<br/><br/>My thoughts on point 2: Vincent's really big on different games being run differently and the GM advice not really being advice, but the actual game procedure.  I've talked about this already though.<br/><br/>On to 3:<br/><br/>EDIT:  Just wanted to add that in terms of communicating, the simple answer is yes, it's a sim thing.  My longer answer is about me not accepting the necessity of creative agenda or its utility compared to other approaches:<br/><br/>My position on the Big Model is that creative agenda only survived as part of it for social reasons and that the model actually works better if you toss creative agenda out and concentrate just on the arrangement of the elements of exploration themselves (and adding challenge and theme as additional elements of exploration).  <br/><br/>Even if I were to keep creative agenda as a thing, I also reject the notion that thematic play is the best indicator that something belongs in the "Story Now" category.  Or that tough choices demonstrate theme when they could just as easily be about characterization.  Or if it really is about theme, then it's about "getting it right" where "it" is an element of fiction.  And thus all the indicators that "Story Now!" is what is happening are better explained inside a "Right to Dream" context when it comes to actual play.   "Story Now" play is likely the attempt to get mimetic play that concerns itself with getting thematic elements to appear during play.<br/><br/>Oh, I also think Lajos Egri was a terrible choice for a source of theory and that the idea that you're only dealing with themes when you are addressing moral issues is a load of crap.  I think Ron Edward's use of Egri has damaged people's ability to identify theme without first connecting it to morality.  It's alienated them from the much richer source that is contemporary literary theory in favor of an anemic theatre theory from 70+ years ago.<br/><br/>As for "fighting from moving vehicles" not really being the material for Keys, I was inspired to make that one after reading the word "motif" again in the Solar System PDF section on making keys.<br/><br/>What's a motif?  It's a recurring element in a narrative that helps establish either a theme or a mood.  If you give either the first Mad Max or the Road Warrior movies a look, the sounds of engines and the appearance of vehicles massively contributes the mood.  In an RPG, it certainly can also be the foundation upon which thematic statements can be made.  Like "every piece of technology can be turned to violent ends" for example.  And note, it's still a thematic statement whether or not I paint that in a moral or immoral light or make no moral statement about it at all.  Even if it's not connected to what a character wants or believes, it's still a thematic statement.  Egri was all about loading the thematic content onto the characters, when there's just so many other ways to do it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408189/#Comment_408189" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T17:40:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  5:40PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 6:37PM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An example of what I'm talking about:\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Key of Faith<br/>Your character has a strong religious belief that guides her. Gain 1 XP every time she defends her faith to others. Gain 2 XP whenever this character converts someone to her faith. Gain 5 XP whenever this character defends her faith even though it brings her great harm. Buyoff: Your character renounces her beliefs.</blockquote>\nEven without looking at the buyoff, it seems pretty clear that this Key is all about a question of value: "How far will you go to defend your faith?"</blockquote>\nWe can answer that question in order to explore character by using theme.  We don't have to make any moral statement whatsoever.  Or if we do, we can ignore the moral aspect.  We can be saying something about who the character <i>is</i> by making a thematic statement with their actions and only care about theme insofar as it aids us with exploring character.  And even if we are concerned with exploring theme, we're doing so to have an experience of the subject matter.  A mimetic experience.<br/><br/>Another approach might be to answer the question "How far will you go to defend your faith?" in an agonistic fashion.  Meeting the challenge to your commitment can be the point of play and it will produce both characterization and a thematic statement as a byproduct.  This would be an exploration of challenge through the use of theme and character.<br/><br/>To get back on topic in terms of Key design, I would say that when I read TSoY and the Solar System PDF, I was a bit confused as to how to identify what to make Keys for and how to construct them, but Eero's post and my rereading of the Story Guide section in the text and the act of contrasting it with the MC procedures from Apocalypse World has really illuminated things for me.  It also sent me looking for previously written stuff on the topic, which refreshed my understanding of the Big Model absent creative agenda which I was thinking about some years ago (2009ish).<br/><br/>I think now I can design Keys endlessly because I get what they can be for.  They can be for characterization.  They can be for exploring theme.  They can be for setting up challenges to meet.  They can be for including genre elements or narrative motifs.  They can be content flags.  I just need to pick what I actually want to accomplish and apply the technique in a way that supports it.<br/><br/>So this whole thing has been super helpful for me.  Even the bringing up of Nar and Sim as it brought back a bunch of stuff to memory.

Player characters begin at relative loose ends and come to find their place in the world when their choices close off other options and shape a more permanent identity for characters who begin as little more than a colourful image devoid of meaning.  The mechanical instrument players use to guide this process of character growth is called a KEY, of which each character possesses one or more.</blockquote>\nSo there's lots of stuff going on there.  We have the theme of character growth and the implicit focusing of a character's identity and characterization that's part of that.<br/><br/>And later:\n<blockquote>The two most common and perhaps most useful frameworks are the DRAMATIC and MOTIVATION frames:<br/><br/>Dramatic Key framework<br/><br/>Keys of this type describe dramatic motifs.<br/><br/>    1xp: The dramatic issue is involved in a scene.<br/>    2xp: The character encounters significant challenges related to the theme.<br/>    5xp: The motif progresses.<br/>    Buyoff: The theme is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>Motivation Key framework<br/><br/>Keys of this type describe psychology.<br/><br/>    1xp: The character expresses the motivation.<br/>    3xp: The character follows the motivation despite risk, personal cost or other considerations.<br/>    Buyoff: The character opts to let go of the trait represented by the Key.</blockquote>\nSo we've got motifs, dramatic issues and themes in one framework and psychology, traits and motivation in another.<br/><br/>I'm also seeing more of a normal language approach here with the use of "themes" and "motifs" which is sourced in contemporary literary theory rather than Egri's ideas.  Including the near interchangeability of motif and theme.<br/><br/>The normal language usage of theme continues here:\n<blockquote>It is also quite appropriate to prepare a list of likely Keys when starting a new campaign in a new setting, as different genres obviously concern themselves with different themes.</blockquote>\nI'd like Eero's take on it as well, but I think it's safe to say the scope of Keys has been expanded in Solar System compared to the original TSoY text.<br/><br/>The motif approach opens up so much more in terms of play beyond a single agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408227/#Comment_408227" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T02:00:06+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  2:00AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My interpretation of the original TSoY text could well be wrong, but my intent in Solar System was not to revise the system much, but rather to merely rephrase and clarify it. Thus I don't think that my interpretation of what Keys are and how they're used differs substantially from Clinton's. My choice of language for the booklet was GNS-free, as I was mostly thinking of a baseline literate audience while writing it - not "lowest common denominator", but people who aren't familiar with Forgean theory discussion.<br/><br/>My take on Paul's premise question is that Keys are (and have always been) in a loose and utilitarian relationship to possible premises that the game might address. That is, I think that it is not entirely useful to attempt tight coupling between preselected premise and Keys. This is largely because of the specific way Keys are selected and utilized in play: players select Keys on the basis of their incomplete understanding of their own characters and interests, and real play will then reveal its true, actual direction to them. Players are not in a position to select premise reliably at the point of play when Keys are chosen, and the game does not have strong guarantee of any given premise being addressed merely because it relates to a Key that is in play. Lacking these two features, it is impossible to claim that Keys have or should have unity with premise.<br/><br/>A different game might attempt such reliable connection, but I suspect that it'd stray further away from roleplaying and closer to joint authorship. The key issue is that the fruitful void of an ordinary narrativist roleplaying game resides in large part in discovering the question, as well as the answer. You can see this in games like Zombie Cinema or Fiasco particularly well: in those games it's almost more exciting when you realize what the question (specifically) is, and the answer often flows relatively naturally from there. That discovery element is important, and a game that successfully locks down the premise during character creation would lack it.<br/><br/>This is not to say that focused prep is not possible in Solar System: the game is specifically loose in this regard, the creative chemistry and goals of the players ultimately determine the balance between exploratory, developmental and resolving types of play. If players give their characters simple Keys that imply strong response to specific sorts of dramatic choices, then everybody at the table is more clear on what that character "is about" from the start. Likewise if you choose Keys that contradict each other. These choices make it easier for the SG to make the obvious connections: my character's all about murder and duty, so the SG has an easy time developing murder and duty content for him to engage. Not nearly all play is so front-loaded, though, and a tradition-embracing game like TSoY leaves plenty of space for less front-loaded play as well.<br/><br/>Considering all that, what do the dramatic Keys or motif Keys (nice name, although some might confuse that with "motivation Key") do, if they don't imply premise? I'd say that the two main functions of these Keys are to imply plot arcs and direct motif development. Plot arcs are essentially thematic choices for players, a Key asks the player an implied question: will you seek bigger and bigger rewards off this Key? Will you even do the buyoff and therefore "finish" the plot arc implied? Motif development is more of a SG issue: given that this "Key of Vampire Slaying" and its implied plot arc require e.g. vampires to come up regularly, what am I going to do about it?<br/><br/>(Motivation Keys are similarly somewhat dual in nature: on the one hand they act as pretty clear guidelines for the players in low-level roleplaying interactions, on the other hand they imply thematic choices where the motivation presented is at cross-purposes with other people or other motivations. Motivation and Dramatic Keys don't have any particular analytical connection, though - they just represent somewhat different, alternative ways of structuring and mechanizing drama. As the SS text implies, there's no particular reason why you couldn't have Keys that are structured differently from both of these.)<br/><br/>Finally: I think that the two postapocalyptic Keys Nathan posted earlier are fine. The "Key of the Road Hog" is pretty specific, so I wouldn't use it in that form unless the campaign was centrally themed around vehicular shenanigans. That's a natural situation when you're coming into the campaign from a very generic angle of approach, though; you'll have lots of material that might prove too widely or too narrowly specced when actual play begins. Not just Keys, either, but Abilities and Secrets as well. A good approach is to calibrate this stuff according to the focal point as it develops. And if the focal point shifts, it's OK to revise the crunch as well; I don't write about this in the SS (it's a basic text, after all), but I've found that it's probably a better idea to revise too generic and too narrow crunch on the fly rather than letting them ride and living with the consequences. The difference is slight, so I'd only do it in a longer campaign, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408295/#Comment_408295" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T14:07:25+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  2:07PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2013 2:09PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, thanks, Eero. That's a good illustration.<br/><br/>However, let me ask the question again in a different way:<br/><br/>As you point out, tying Keys too directly to the premise of a Narrativist game puts you on dangerous ground: the game becomes a little too blatant, loses the room it needs to breathe. A less direct relationship seems better (and is what I would do in the game, instinctively).<br/><br/>(As a sidenote: However, I still think it's there. If a character has the Key of Faith, and the player constantly points the character at interesting dilemmas and situations which have to do with her faith, and her doubts about it, it's hard to imagine that <i>at some point</i> in play the XP rewards won't align with an interesting question of premise. The potential is constantly there, and we can play with it as we like.)<br/><br/>However, that's not even what I was trying to ask about. I've thought it over a little more, and here's a better way of phrasing my question (which, incidentally, doesn't require talking about Creative Agenda):<br/><br/>In TSoY, it seems to me that most of Clinton's Keys have to do fundamentally with significant character choice. For instance, an XP reward like "help someone who can't help themselves" can't be claimed without making a strong statement about the character, their relationship to the other person, and the choices they make, their priorities.<br/><br/>However, your description in Solar System (I wish I had it on hand, I can't remember the specific example--it was about vampires, I think--but I do remember one of the criteria being "the motif progresses") seems to me to broaden the scope to Keys which are more about "what happens in the story" than about choices the characters make.<br/><br/><i>The Key of the Road Hog</i> is a good example, since it moves more in that direction. An XP criterion like "get hurt while atop a moving vehicle" is closer to a description of an event in play than it is to a significant decision the character could make.<br/><br/>It says to the group, "I want to see some scenes where my guy's on top of a moving car, and he gets shot!" It's entirely possible that the character won't be able to ever activate this Key on his own: it will be up to the other players, instead (for example, someone needs to take action to shoot at him if he climbs up on a car, right?).<br/><br/>So what are your thoughts on Key criteria which deal with significant character choice (i.e. player actions) versus Keys which tell us what kinds of situations we'd like to see "on screen"?<br/><br/>(You can hopefully see why this makes me think of Narrativism vs. Simulationism, but it may be that it's more about player-initiated Key use vs. Story Guide-initiated Key activation, which isn't exactly the same thing, and probably a better way to discuss this issue without stepping on peoples' toes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408309/#Comment_408309" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T16:02:23+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  4:02PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Motif development is more of a SG issue: given that this "Key of Vampire Slaying" and its implied plot arc require e.g. vampires to come up regularly, what am I going to do about it?</blockquote>\nThis is what I was thinking of when I mentioned Keys as flags, but you put it a lot more clearly.\n<blockquote> Finally: I think that the two postapocalyptic Keys Nathan posted earlier are fine.

So far half of the players have expressed the desire to have some sort of vehicle and be part of some sort of mobile convoy and the rest of the people's ideas work well from that starting point and have okayed it.

It's a flag saying "hey, I'm in a car, shoot at me, or ram me or something!  I'm coming for you!"<br/><br/>I made "hurt" more general than getting shot so the player could also ram other vehicles, or wipe out or do a variety of dangerous things while on a vehicle and still get XP.  Many, many ways to get hurt on a vehicle do require someone to be in conflict with though.  You could also jump from one moving vehicle to another and get hurt.  I suppose you could combine it with the Key of the Masochist and just fling yourself into crazy vehicle related danger at every opportunity.\n<blockquote>(You can hopefully see why this makes me think of Narrativism vs. Simulationism, but it may be that it's more about player-initiated Key use vs. Story Guide-initiated Key activation, which isn't exactly the same thing, and probably a better way to discuss this issue without stepping on peoples' toes.)</blockquote>\nActually you're bringing up the Nar/Sim thing is totally what jogged my memory on a lot of theory stuff and made me reconnect with some of my thinking about gaming.  I reread some old discussions and blog posts and now feel like I'm totally ready to really make Keys sing in this game.  Eero's given me an "aha moment" with the SG created keys and the limited elements needed for dramatic characterization (as well as my rereading of the SG and AW MC sections) but your mentioning of Nar/Sim gave me just as much of an "aha moment" in terms of the practical application of techniques without seeing them married to a particular priority in play.  I may be an a-creativeagenda-ist in terms of its effect on the utility of the big model largely being one of distraction, and really down on Egri, but it was still very, very useful to be reminded of stuff I hadn't thought about in a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408315/#Comment_408315" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T16:31:33+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  4:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Of course there are tendencies, but ultimately the entire range of options relies on cooperation: the SG needs to provide a NPC in need for a player to make the choice to help them, and there is only so much that the player can do about ensuring their own Key-fulfillment conditions. If anything, I'd say that completely independent Keys are a problem: a player whose Keys can be triggered without significant creative interaction with other players is probably either intentionally or accidentally cordoning themselves off from the events of the game. For this reason I tend to be critical of Keys that depict incestuous events that the character causes himself, without caring anything about what happens around him.<br/><br/>Ideally Keys are something the SG looks at hard and often from the viewpoint of a plot-writer who's been given a well-defined, expensive IP to play with: <em>given</em> that I'm writing a Batman story, what elements will the story have? I will be a poor Batman writer if Batman never gets a chance to e.g. shut off people near him due to excess feelings of duty, or decide to not kill a human monster due to commitment to life. Rather, one would assume that the SG guiding for Batman would intentionally work towards highlighting these things: the SG wins when the Keys are activated, or not activated, by player choices.<br/><br/>From the viewpoint of this two-way dance the difference between the Key of Faith and Key of Road Hog is mainly in the specific sequence of interaction that the players engage in to arrive at a moment where the Key is scored: with the Key of Faith the SG introduces NPCs and the player picks and chooses which to interact with in Faith-related ways (this was the missionary Key, right?). With the Key of the Road Hog the player chooses to have their character own and occupy a vehicle, while the SG chooses to have a chase occur, and that enables the Key to function. In one of these Keys the SG is providing the background and the player is providing the immediate action, while in the other it's the other way around. Is this a significant difference? Maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408352/#Comment_408352" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T07:10:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  7:10AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great point, Eero.<br/><br/>So you don't feel that, in play, something like the Key of Faith leads to a different kind of interaction than the Key of the Road Hog? It seems to me that, as a group, we would be more likely to play towards moral dilemmas when a character has the Key of Faith and more likely to aim towards something like genre emulation in the case of the Key of the Road Hog.

Of course it's a factor in the mix of aesthetic choices we make in play. A game like TSoY has a lot of moving parts, ultimately, and testing them in isolation is pretty difficult. Keys will certainly have different feel and emphasis when minor details are altered, but I don't know that it'd be possible to elect one end of the continuum preferable against the other.<br/><br/>I might offer as a basic bit of advice that different players relate to the notion of a "rpg character" differently either by nature or nurture, and therefore the game has certain flexibility and leeway in accomodating these preferences. Solar System is very much not a one-note machine in that it leaves the group quite a bit of room to answer basic questions for themselves: how tight is the dramatic situation of this character as play begins? How clear-cut are his motivations? Some characters are very narrowly defined as being about this specific scenario and situation, while others are about a specific sort of activity and milieu. Both need means of gaining experience points, and the SG can challenge both as to their identity via their Keys.<br/><br/>Part of my attitude on this is my current conviction that a game like TSoY or AW or Burning Wheel fares best socially when you acknowledge that realistically only a part of your group will be committed to playing an equally important dramatic ensemble cast. This isn't the case for everybody, but in my experience it's common for naturally occurring rpg groups to involve players who want to see eye-to-eye with the GM, as well as players who want to merely participate and react, but not seize leadership and creative responsibility. I've attempted to write my TSoY texts with more of an eye towards accomodating this real social situation: it's OK if one of the players just wants to play Wolverine, SS can handle that procedurally without insisting that the player transforms into a drama hog along the way. I get much better response from a certain sort of gamer with this lax attitude where I let them build towards dramatic commitment slowly through play, rather than demanding them to put up or shut up like e.g. My Life with Master (to pick an arbitrary example of a game that doesn't accept differently-abled play) does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408375/#Comment_408375" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T11:44:39+00:00" title="March  7, 2013 11:44AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes, that makes sense.

The people at the table, quite frankly, want different things.  It's awesome to see an approach that actually recognizes the social reality at the table and tries to work with it rather than assuming that the thing to do is to get everyone on the same page or find people who are already looking for the same things out of their games.<br/><br/>There's going to be a person at the table who loves playing supporting characters but doesn't like driving towards conflict (otherwise they'd be the SG).  That person can select Keys that reward them for jumping in with another character's goals.  And if over time he figures out something he wants for his character, he can get a Key to reward himself for doing so and wade as deep as he wants into the pool.<br/><br/>There's another player who loves building the sheet potency of their character over time.  The way conflicts are extended combined with stake setting gives that player a level of protection for his creation not found in a lot of other games.  He's excited how it's okay for him just to say "my character either dying or having his abilities reduced in a permanent way just isn't on the table this game."  And beyond the general support for character protection in SS, we can also use the ideas of propriety and scope to come to an understanding that he can decline stakes that would damage his creation.  Much in the same way a Minecraft server often has anti-griefing rules.  <br/><br/>Another thing about Solar System in this matter is that it really supports what Rob Donoghue calls "the trick" where instead of giving his character complications directly or going after his character directly, I can go after supporting characters or other PCs he cares about and then have them ask him for help.  A key related to family or fraternity or a tendency to say yes when people ask for help can be used to give him XP when he deals with an issue that if it was aimed directly at him would make him uncomfortable.  This will also work well for the first player I mentioned, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>There's another player who is all about meeting challenges and making choices.  He doesn't care whether or not that ends up making a statement about a theme or demonstrating his or his character's value system.  He just wants to enjoy the process of having to deal with a situation in the fiction and enjoying the down beats that happen on the other side of them as either sighs of relief or a victory dance.  Conflicts, extended conflicts followed by a refresh scenes just natively handle this.  And I'm sure he'll structure his keys in a way that give him XP for diving into that.<br/><br/>And then there's a player is about genre colour and showing who his character is.  To borrow Apocalypse World language, he'll be the one "puking apocalyptica" even more than me.  Motif keys are probably going to be useful here, but also motivation keys as one lets him show the kinds of things his character is involved in and the other lets him show what his character cares about.  And then there's the fact that he can drop and change keys over time as he becomes interested in dealing with different subject matter.<br/><br/>What do I want out of the game?  I like to see what happens.  I like to point trouble in different directions and see what results.  I like playing characters that go after what they want but ultimately are not the ones who overcome.  I want to take flags and make scenes that work for them.  I like stage management in terms of mood music, throwing evocative images up on the screen in the room, setting the scene, pacing and so forth. <br/><br/>I bet a lot of die-hard GNSers might be inclined to prophecy great doom for the game because of these supposed mismatches in "creative agenda".  However, having played with this group for years, I can only assume that such a position is the result of the model being built on the foundation of assumed widespread non-functional play (see the first paragraph of "GNS and other Matters").  Just like I might not be too concerned about what a theory of sexuality has to say if it was built on a pool of subjects that were all transgressors.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408398/#Comment_408398" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T16:02:47+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  4:02PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            frozenwastes, that sounds fantastic to me! I would also argue that Solar System is one of the best tools available for what you're trying to do. And it has a lot to do with what you're describing: this is a game which makes it easy to adjust the crunch as well as the table dynamics to match your group, and to allow different types of players to work together.

He also made his character invaluable in the community and really set himself up for a ton of spot light time.<br/><br/>I'll post more detail later, but the first session was great.  Setting creation followed by character creation followed by two rounds of scenes.  Everyone did great with their heroic scenes, background and the like and with their initial scenes.  We had some key scenes, some conflicts, one extended conflict (though only extended to two rounds before the PC gave) and even a refresh scene.  And two scenes in which effects were created.  A well prepared medical bag (R/4) and Pretty quartz crystals (I/2).  We figured Instinct for the quartz because it's a trade goods and Barter is an Instinct skill for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408547/#Comment_408547" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T01:36:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  1:36AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One problem that Solar System is prone to is that the basic premise of the game is that players know what they want, and they'll flag these desires honestly - but this is not always the case. So as SG you always need to be just a little bit skeptical about the implicit claims that the players make via their choice of crunch: does this player actually want to have the character's competense as say an assassin questioned, as this crunch selection implies, or does he want his claim of lethality to pass unquestioned?<br/><br/>That aside, sounds to me like you had a solid first session, that's about what I get when we start a campaign from scratch. The fact that you could get into an extended conflict and then have somebody give up instead of fighting all the way to death is also good, it tends to be a bit of a difficult thing for people to grasp.<br/><br/>As Story Guide you might prepare for the next session with various tools. As the Solar System text outlines, the job is to provide fictional content, and then coordinate the exploration of the fictional matter towards dramatic events. Basically this is about combining your own inspiration ("barf forth apocalyptica" as AW says) with your best understanding of what the acknowledged topic of the game is. The latter is theoretically found in the Keys and Secrets that the players have written down on their character sheets, so theoretically you'll hit the mark dramatically by preparing subject matter towards which the player characters are mechanically relevant. In other words: if there is a Key of Vampire Slayer, prepare vampires, but make them vampires that are interesting to you (at least to you) artistically.<br/><br/>The practical means of achieving that prep depends on taste. The SS text makes mention of one simple method (the story map) that I myself like to use, but you could also e.g. lift the fronts methodology from AW wholesale. Whatever inspires ideas and builds SG confidence.<br/><br/>Also, one thing that is particularly useful to do in a campaign that's started from scratch is to bring new crunch to all sessions regularly. For example, you might think of a few ways to leverage the idea of barter in a postapocalyptic environment, and then create a Secret based on that. Once you've got an entertaining piece of crunch, you can posit an identity challenge to an appropriate character: my NPC here, they've got a cool new Secret - do you want it? Even if learning/buying/stealing it requires a bit of effort and allegiance to new elements? This is how the SG can provoke character identities to evolve, by providing opportunities for the characters to become something they weren't before. And an organically evolving crunch environment provides fresh opportunities for exciting mechanical discoveries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408560/#Comment_408560" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T09:43:03+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  9:43AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game sounds like a great success so far.

From what I understand the buy off should be something that can happen again and again rather than a once and only departure from the thing.  So the Key of the Prospector shouldn't have a Buy Off of "give up prospecting" but something else.  Something more like "falling off the wagon" during recovery rather than going back to being a raging alcoholic and "giving up sobriety".  So I put "work for pay" in there for now and I'll revisit it with the player later to confirm.<br/><br/><b>Secret of Electricity </b>- You know about power generation, wiring and the like.  You can use your Abilities in matters related to electricity while those without the secret can't.<br/><br/><b>Secret of Explosives</b> - You know how to make and set explosives.  You can use your abilities in matters related to explosives while those without the secret can't.<br/><br/>The character with the Key of the Prospector is looking to strike it rich in the mountains so he has the financial clout to move his family from the crappy town they live in now to the nearby fortress known as "The Gated Community" where the defacto nobles of the area live.<br/><br/>The character with the Key of the Heart of Gold is a town prostitute favoured by the Mayor of the Gated Community.  And the Mayor's wife knows about it.<br/><br/>The character with the Key of Curiosity also has the Secret of Electricity.  Subsequently, he's actually quite valuable to the community and has unknowingly made the list of eligible gentlemen for one of the women of the Gated Community to marry.

So as SG you always need to be just a little bit skeptical about the implicit claims that the players make via their choice of crunch: does this player actually want to have the character's competense as say an assassin questioned, as this crunch selection implies, or does he want his claim of lethality to pass unquestioned?</blockquote>\nI thought this might be the case when they first described the keys they wanted.  But then when I started framing scenes they actually went for them pretty aggressively.\n<blockquote>The fact that you could get into an extended conflict and then have somebody give up instead of fighting all the way to death is also good, it tends to be a bit of a difficult thing for people to grasp.</blockquote>\nHe knew he was outmatched. He ran afoul of the Gated Community's chief scout who thinks his mucking about bringing electricity back to the townsfolk is a waste of time when he should be repairing vehicles and whatnot for the Mayor's Convoy.  He took a few lumps and left the drinking hall embarrassed as the men of the Convoy laughed at him.\n<blockquote>Basically this is about combining your own inspiration ("barf forth apocalyptica" as AW says) with your best understanding of what the acknowledged topic of the game is. The latter is theoretically found in the Keys and Secrets that the players have written down on their character sheets, so theoretically you'll hit the mark dramatically by preparing subject matter towards which the player characters are mechanically relevant. In other words: if there is a Key of Vampire Slayer, prepare vampires, but make them vampires that are interesting to you (at least to you) artistically.</blockquote>\nI'm thinking the direction we are heading next is a raid by the cannibals who live in the swamp down the mountain side.  The prospector has been detonating his early explosive experiments and they think it's the mountain god speaking to them.  And whenever something of religious or cultural significance happens (a new child is born, a boy reaches manhood, a member of the community dies) they honour the Mountain God by eating another human being in a big communal meal.  <br/><br/>They don't cross the well armed Convoy or the Gated Community too often.  Even the townsfolk aren't grabbed too often as it's often easier to just grab an old man from another swamp tribe.  This has lead to a lot of internecine fighting in the area surrounding the mountain.  But the strange sounds from the mountain has attracted their attention and it's time to Eat of the Body and Drink of the Blood.

I think after seeing how the rules work, the player that often turtles to protect his character sees that this isn't a game where he's going to take attribute damage or get levels drained away by the touch of a wraith or something like that.  So he can go after what he really wants instead of safe guarding what he's eeked out so far.\n<blockquote>I hope you will share the crunch you're developing for the game with us; I, for one, would love to see how our whole Key-design discussion affected (or didn't affect) your group's choice of Keys, or the design of new Keys.</blockquote>\nI ended up going with the motif/theme key vs the motivation key difference when I explained the two different Key Frameworks to them.  I showed them the Key of the Mad Scientist and the Key of LGBT from the Solar System PDF as examples of the motif/theme framework and the Key of Vow and Key of Idol as motivation Key examples.  Then we developed one of each for a character I was sort of building alongside them.  Then they went around the table building their starting Key.  Motif/theme keys mostly dominated that original round, but when we were spending Advances it was almost all motivation keys.<br/><br/>I chose the Vow Key and the Idol Key because one shows that keys where the buy-off is a complete departure from the key is probably better as a buy-off for a motivation key than a motif/theme key.  The other shows that motivation keys can have their opposite in the 3XP line and still work great.<br/><br/>In the end though, I still had to go back and forth a bit with the buy-offs as they were proposing "I leave this activity behind forever" as their buy off, when something like the "Go to rehab" is far more interesting of a buyoff for the Key of the Rock Star than "give up music".  It took some doing to convince them that they could make a decision that contradicted their key and choose not to buy it off.

Especially the post Mad Max vision of a barren wasteland.<br/><br/>That thing about Buyoff caught my eye. As I understand it, you've decided that a non-permanent Buyoff condition is better than one that is clearly permanent. This interests me, as I pretty much encourage the opposite thinking: buying off a Key is a permanent change in the character, and in dramatic terms it usually means putting that topic aside for good. If the game were a TV series, buying off the Key would be the moment when the writers genuinely decide that they've had enough of a given theme, and it will not recur anymore. (Of course it's difficult to find writers with enough integrity to stick to these decisions, but that's another story.)<br/><br/>Consequently I think that "Give up drinking for good" is a fine Buyoff condition, while "Try to stop drinking" is not as good because it's more ambivalent. Technically these are the exact same thing, as both remove the Key, and neither actually prevents the theme from factually recurring - the player or SG can always take the game towards a direction that leads to the character's alcoholism recurring. There is no binding pre-scripting in the game. Mostly it's a matter of communication and decisive creativity: I like that Keys are only bought or removed as decisive commitments to new direction, rather than mere experiments.<br/><br/>For characters going back and forth on a topic it's often better to have them declare in-fiction that they're going to give up drinking, but keep the Key: essentially the player is reserving the option of sinking back into alcoholism later if opportunity presents itself. They can always sell the Key later, if they decide to permanently quit this element of their character. If the very act of going back and forth is the important theme for the character, then a Key related to that ("Key of Indecision" or whatever) would be appropriate as well or instead of the original Key.<br/><br/>Practically your Keys are just fine, although I would give the Key of the Prospector a more striking Buyoff: in my mind the prospecting ethos is about an optimistic lottery mentality, so I'd make the Buyoff be something like "Settle down in a day-job" or something similarly decisive. Again it's the same thing, really, but I just like to express it as a sufficiently dramatic decision. Not just any random stop-gap job, but a decisive commitment to give up on prospecting and becoming a regular worker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408704/#Comment_408704" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T01:36:22+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  1:36AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2013 4:29AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read in the PDF:\n<blockquote>The BUYOFF is a special circumstance as well: when it happens, the player has the <i>option</i> of removing the Key and scoring 10 XP at once.  The catch is that characters may never regain a Key once bought off: the buyoff is always a permanent change to the character.</blockquote>\nSo I assumed that any activity that makes the key unable to be scored would be pretty inappropriate as at that point it's effectively <i>not optional</i>.<br/><br/>I sort of got the idea from the examples in the Solar System PDF.  I noticed that in many, many cases you can keep hitting your Key's XP lines after you've done whatever action the buy-off says.  Or even for many, the actions in the buy offs seem to strengthen the dramatic characterization of the key.<br/><br/>So I assumed it was a situation where the player has to decide that **this** is the instance where the character truly changes.  Actually choosing to buy the key off is permanent, but lots of times you don't have characters make clean breaks with their past selves, but instead go through a transition period where the frequency of a theme or motif and its opposite change back and forth.\n<blockquote>If the very act of going back and forth is the important theme for the character, then a Key related to that ("Key of Indecision" or whatever) would be appropriate as well or instead of the original Key.</blockquote>\nOr take two opposing Keys.<br/><br/>I want Buy Off texts that make it clear that it is not "for good" but only when the <i>player says it is.</i>  The act itself does not buy off the key (it is the player choosing to do so that does) so they probably shouldn't be something that nullifies the key's experience lines.<br/><br/>I largely think I'm still in agreement with what you're saying about the Keys buy-offs being about player choice-- I want it explicitly to be so.  If a player causes a scene that hits the buyoff line and doesn't opt to buy it off, the action in question probably shouldn't nullify the key anyway as motif keys are about what content the player wants in play or what they want to say about their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408706/#Comment_408706" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T02:24:49+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  2:24AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That all makes sense, so I don't think that we're disagreeing. I definitely think that the coupling of the fictional events and the decision to buy off a Key is very loose - the event indicated in the Buyoff can occur without the player choosing to remove the Key. However, I like it better if the Buyoff event is pretty serious and weighty in itself, as I don't like it when players can get rid of Keys trivially. For this reason I prefer to phrase the Buyoff condition in a pretty dramatic manner. So the difference I see here is not between repeatable vs. singular, but rather dramatically serious and trivially achievable, if that makes sense. A fictional event may well be logically easy to repeat in a story (like getting into a clinic), but that is perpendicular to whether the event is dramatic or routine in nature.<br/><br/>Basically: does this buyoff make a good scene to roleplay? If the only thing the player likely wants to say about the buyoff is that he wants to do it, and it doesn't motivate more detailed introspection and roleplaying, then it's not a good Buyoff in my mind. This is what makes Buyoffs of type "The character decides to drop the Key" dull: they're too easy for the player to merely declare as a mechanical move without associated fictional events. Something like "consummate the relationship sexually" is much better, as it is provocative and will likely involve discussion/narration of when, why, how events proceed in this way. Whether the event is repeatable or one-off (some Keys are genuinely such that the Buyoff condition comes around only once as a logical necessity) is not as important as this quality of dramatic spark.<br/><br/>Also, incidentally: I hope everybody understands that my list of example Keys in the SS booklet is somewhat tongue in cheek; I attempted to push the envelope in different directions there, providing both pretty mundane applications as well as more surprising and radical ones so as to show different ways to tackle Key design. I wouldn't necessarily stand behind all of those Keys as emblematic good design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408708/#Comment_408708" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T04:28:38+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  4:28AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2013 4:53AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Basically: does this buyoff make a good scene to roleplay?

It's great.<br/><br/>So the prospector Key probably needs something stronger than "work for pay" and more like "start living off of paid work."  A real transition in the fiction where the character is no longer eeking out a living looking for ore deposits.  I think going to work for the Mayor in his mines would be a great scene.  And the scene where he asks for the work would be even better.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on the Heart of Gold buyoff?  "Refuse a well paying customer" now seems a bit weak to me.  "Find another source of income" doesn't really work as it implies the transition out of prostitution won't be into poverty, when it very well could be, especially considering the setting.  I guess "Leave prostitution" works.  Given the expectations the settlement has for the character, the job change would be quite interesting and problematic as a scene to roleplay.<br/><br/>The doctor one needs work as well.  Just refusing someone care isn't going to cut it.   But "Give up medicine" is icky to me in a post apocalyptic setting.  It's not his career in a modern sense.  It's more like a tribal identity, so refusing to help is more at the meat of the issue, but it could easily be done in a way that's not a major fictional change.  <br/><br/>For example, letting some outsider scumbag he doesn't care about die certainly doesn't effect his role within his community.  Maybe "refuse to treat a member of his settlement."  If he "leaves medicine" it's more like a military medic refusing to treat a member of his unit than a guy working at a hospital getting a job in pharmaceutical sales.  There will be real repercussions.  The military medic would likely face court marshal and the post-apoc doctor might be forced into compliance, enslaved, exiled or even killed.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408713/#Comment_408713" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T05:49:18+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  5:49AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did consider the Heart of Gold, so it's clearly sort of borderline. I didn't comment on it because of how concrete and symbolic such refusal almost necessarily is - it's probably not going to happen on a whim between scenes, the player's going to explain why this time around they don't want to entertain this specific client.<br/><br/>The Key of the Doctor is basically the same in that it's about a pretty dramatic and concrete thing as well. There's going to be a scene where the character shows us that their commitment to the discipline and outlook of medicine is not, after all, all-encompassing. Sex and death, they're probably not going to be undramatic. And if players try to pass them off as routine, I can always ask for more.<br/><br/>I do salt these sorts of Keys now and then with pretty high-threshold Buyoffs, but that's mainly because the locals here like playing around and through difficult and merciless crunch. A "salted" version of these occupation Keys would probably involve a highly specific and extreme Buyoff. For example, "Your prostitute finds the love of their life and settles down with them", that sort of thing - it all but forces you to play through some sort of Pretty Woman episode if you want to get rid of that Key. A similarly opinionated version of the doctor Key would involve something like "Break your Hippcratic Oath" or "Let somebody in your care die" or "Kill a human being", whatever would fit the genre and setting and the Key's understanding of what it is to be a doctor. Keys can be pretty specific about what they're about, it's not necessarily a flaw for a Key to be forcible and specific, and intentionally non-simulative. Maybe some other prostitute gets out of the job just by quitting, but for <i>this</i> one it's going to always be on the table thematically until they fulfill a proper love story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408717/#Comment_408717" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T07:22:37+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  7:22AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In this case, I think the prostitute character is going to transition into a thief/robber who uses her trade to get her victims alone.

It's *nice* if a buyoff is something that could occur on a few different occasions, but really the defining thing about it is that it displays an interesting transformation of the character to the "audience". I like Eero's suggested choices for the doctor Key, they hit the right notes. When it comes to the Heart of Gold, my instinct is also similar: the first thing that comes to mind is something like "accept an offer of marriage". But, maybe once you establish some kind of symbolic connection to prostitution in your game (e.g. all prostitutes occupy a street corner in the town, or they all wear a certain item of clothing), you can rewrite the buyoff to be in line with that (e.g. "hand over your [symbolic thing] to a younger woman", or "leave this town/your customers behind forever").<br/><br/>I don't see any issue with taking a flexible approach in the buyoff, incidentally, so long as the players are on board with the whole idea of the Key Buyoff as a thematic statement. I could see going, "Yeah, ok, this <i>does</i> seem like a good moment to buy off this Key," even if we're looking at a turning point different from the buyoff written at the start. On the other hand, if the players don't fully understand yet how Keys work, it might be more fruitful to write a clear buyoff condition and stick closely to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410187/#Comment_410187" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T23:55:32+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 11:55PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2013 12:00AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we had another session and the last player who will be joining us made a character.  For his "heroic scene" he literally played a youtube clip from the Road Warrior movie.  His character's name is "Mel".  He doesn't have a dog though.<br/><br/>He ended up taking this reworked version of my road hog key entitled the Key of the Road Warrior<br/>1 XP Participate in vehicular violence<br/>2 XP Escape from danger in a vehicle<br/>5 XP Kill someone with a vehicle<br/>Buyoff: Get rid of his car<br/><br/>He also took the Secret of Equipment (Combat Car) for his awesome armour plated 70s muscle car.  Pretty much straight out of the Solar System PDF sample secret section.<br/><br/>He started his character "in motion" with his character being chased by two raider vehicles.  He put almost all his initial 5 advances into driving and stuck with an extended conflict until he made it to the safety of the settlement where the other characters were.  We even had changing goals through a defensive action on his part.<br/><br/>Another character ended up getting ambushed by three valley cannibals and he was in the opposite situation of not having the abilities in the right places to fend them off.  He lost the initial conflict and extended, hoping to get lucky, but he quickly gave in and ended up being knocked senseless and stuffed into a large sack and wrapped up with some rope.<br/><br/>The player of the prostitute character started his transition of the character out of prostitution and more into being a criminal who uses sex as a weapon.  He kept the Heart of Gold key but added a motivation key related to stealing from others.  She's reaching the point where people have been taking from her so long that she's tired of it.  <br/><br/>Key of Stealing<br/>1 XP: Steal something<br/>3 XP: Steal something someone else really wants<br/>Buy Off:  Return stolen goods<br/><br/>At this point I'm expecting a major heist/con to be eventually done against the Gated Community and the buying off of the Key of the Heart of Gold to be when she refuses the Mayor's patronage by robbing or killing him.<br/><br/>She had an altercation with one of the valley cannibals that came into town to drag off food for their holy communion and we had our first killing during a scene where she gutted him with a carving knife while he was trying to stuff a local orphan into his canvas bag.  We've had some fighting, a chase scene and the like, I'm beginning to think of conflicts related to fighting as less of a combat system and more of a violence system.<br/><br/>The way we've been handling equipment is entirely with effects.  I don't know if this is the best way, but the way we have been doing it is that if you want an effect's bonus for your equipment you need to have a scene in which you create the effect.  For example, the prostitute having a scene where she's talking with another character while she sharpens the carving knife she uses to defend herself in rough situations.  Or the Roadwarrior talks with the prospector in the local drinking establishment while he disassembles and cleans his gun.  Basically if you want something to feature in a future scene and give you a bonus, you need to show it to everyone beforehand.<br/><br/>Is it appropriate to have effects created during refresh scenes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410193/#Comment_410193" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T01:40:54+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  1:40AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the write-up, I like where you're going here! The car guy'll be easy to play with as SG, you just need to offer opportunities for him to be the big man because he has a car that can take things from point A to point B - and then you need to show him how dependent he is on the community to provide the technical infrastructure that he needs to keep the car going over time. You should also bring in a series of increasingly wealthy NPCs who want to buy his car <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Using Effects for equipment is entirely kosher. In fact, I suspect that it's the more straightforward and pleasing method for most groups. The SS text is a bit ambivalent on the topic because I wanted to retain backwards compatibility and blow the possibilities wide open. Clinton's equipment system is tricky (you can read the equipment section in World of Near if you want to see what I ultimately ended up doing with it), and a low-crunch campaign might do pretty well by just doing Effects.<br/><br/>Of course, that leaves the special muscle car, which is definitely Equipment in the strong sense. As you see in the SS booklet, you could do this sort of important equipment in two ways: the classical way with the equipment ratings, or with Effects, in which version the Secret of owning the car simply gives the character a free Effect. The feel in these is pretty different, of course, and if the player likes fiddling with the equipment ratings, then that's a fine choice.<br/><br/>(Of course if you're using Equipment ratings, I recommend looking at that World of Near chapter on the topic. I specifically wrote that to fix how strong ratings are - they're easily the most overpowered piece of crunch in classical TSoY, for better or worse. That feel might work well in a post-apocalyptic setting, of course, where equipment is sparse and a big deal.)<br/><br/>Also, a reminder about how to do equipment maintenance when using only Effects: say that a character has an Effect, "My sharp knife 1/I". They were in a knife fight where they expended all but one bonus die out of the Effect. Now they want to "fix" the knife so it's ready for the next situation. In that situation you shouldn't just have the player roll a new Effect next to the old one, so they end up with two Effects (untidy, and mechanically dull), but rather have them roll the old Effect into the maintenance check as bonus dice - one bonus die in this case. This way the dice still left in the old Effect don't go to "waste" when you reroll the Effect, and you maintain the idea that each separate line of crunch on the character sheet corresponds to a different fictional idea. Of course this means that maintaining your equipment might potentially make it worse than it used to be, if you roll really badly. Rolling a failure on a maintenance check breaks the equipment, or establishes that it's too used up to be fixed anymore.\n<blockquote>Is it appropriate to have effects created during refresh scenes?</blockquote>\nYeah, definitely. We occasionally discuss this topic, and some people seem to think that refresh scenes should be "no dice at all" to count as that, but I think that it's fine to engage mechanics as long as the scene substantially fulfills the dramatic requirements of a refreshment scene. If the scene involves both a refreshment and equipment maintenance, then good for them. Of course it's not refreshment if the scene is just working on equipment, it needs to have that playful social quality that shows the human side of the characters.<br/><br/>Another typical situation is one where a scene starts as refreshment, but then changes into something else as e.g. guards come in to capture Conan and drag him away. It still counts as refreshment if we've established that refreshment happened. You can basically only cancel a refreshment scene in progress by an explicit character choice to not let their hair down in this situation after all - say the SG frames a refreshment scene with a NPC the PC hates, and the player backs out dramatically at the last moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
