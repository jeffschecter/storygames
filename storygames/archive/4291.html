So far, in fact, that I'm ready to see if what I've written will work at other people's tables as well as it has at mine. If my wife can play and enjoy this game, then I feel it can have a broad appeal.<br/><br/>Please check out my blog and the Google Doc version and see if this is the kind of game you'd want to try out and help develop. All I ask for are some good actual play reports. If you want to do this but don't feel that you want to report an AP publicly, that's fine! You can send them to my email as well.<br/><br/>Playtesters will be given some sort of real-world compensation depending on how the final product is released. You also gain Playtest Debt wherein I return the favor and play your game for you (if such a situation arises).<br/><br/>Questions about the game can be asked here or at my blog. Previous discussion can be found on a previous thread on Story Games, see below.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>Story Game Thread: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4044" rel="nofollow">Here</a><br/>Blog: <a href="http://markcausey.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">Here</a><br/>Google Doc: <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dzmzjr6_5gcn35k" rel="nofollow">Here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96824/#Comment_96824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T06:14:06+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  6:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have made an update this morning. I'd left out my Coin Economy, which I'm rather eager to see if testing bears out the utility of.
