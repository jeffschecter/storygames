It's also ideal for inviting another couple over for dinner, and playing afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316472/#Comment_316472" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T16:22:15+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  4:22PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was it about Perfect that sold her on it?<br/><br/>We need more details!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316476/#Comment_316476" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T16:42:11+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  4:42PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2011 6:34AM by Seth Drebitko.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry that was very brief. The initial thing that caught her was the cover. It didn't look like an rpg so she cracked it open thinking it was a "normal" book. Like most people she skipped the intro and went to chapter 1 and was giddy about the picture and quote of the queen. She flipped through the setting info a bit and tossed the book to the side waiting for me to get home. When I did she demanded I give her the run down; so, I explained that it was like the movie Equilibrium in Steam Punk Victorian England with a criminal underground trying to push culture on the oppressed masses who blindly eat their pudding as their told...some times you just want ice cream dammit!<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think it came down to a concept that really just struck her fancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave not gotten the chance to fully read everything yet but it sounded good to me lol.<br/>\nEdit: Once I get the chance to actually read through things fully and play wife the wife I'll make sure to give another update.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
