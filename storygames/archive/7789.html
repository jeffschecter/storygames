Here's the idea:<br/><br/>First, you need to come up with 13 "rules" for your culture.  They should range from really broad, general, and non-intrusive, through to very specific, all-encompassing laws.  You can crib them from existing cultures if you like.  Depending on the game, maybe everyone can help come up with these.  Number them 2-10, then Jack, Queen, King.  For example:<br/><br/>2: People wear blue for mourning.<br/>3: Women always get first choice of food, and the eldest choose first.<br/>|<br/>8: There is a tribe called the "Gazzir" who provide guards to aristocratic families.  The tribe is reknowned for honour unto death, and fanatical loyalty to employers.<br/>9: Swords are forbidden to be carried by anyone not of noble liniage.  For this reason, pole arms are common.<br/>|<br/>Queen: Those who are sentanced to death, or contemplating suicide, can opt to join a sect of monks called "the Nameless".  They give up their old identities, and live ascetic lives of servitude.<br/>King: The Emperor's word is law, and none may question it and live.  <br/><br/>Now, in game, when you need an off-the-cuff NPC, or if you're preparing NPCs for a game, draw a card.  Referencing the number on the card, check the suit:<br/><br/>Hearts: The character embodies, enacts, or enforces the rule.<br/>Diamonds: The character twists, alters, or avoids the rule.<br/>Spades: The character's life is altered (for good or bad) by the rule.<br/>Clubs: The character breaks the rule. <br/><br/>So, drawing from the above list:<br/><br/>2 of Diamonds: Alaric the Mason wears blue every day, and has done for years.  No one knows if he's mourning a long-dead wife, or if he's just weird.  Though he seems perfectly normal in other respects, it makes people suspicious.<br/><br/>3 of Spades: Gwen is the mother of five hungry children, and poor.  She lives with her mother-in-law, who always chooses the most food for herself, leaving very little for Gwen and the children.  Gwen is forced to eat almost nothing, so her children can survive.<br/><br/>8 of Clubs: Numun the Betrayer was a Gazzir guard who betrayed his employer, a cruel and merciless man.  Numun and a few of his friends slew the man.  Now Numun's tribe is hunting him down to restor their honour. <br/><br/>9 of Hearts: Darran of Everwood is a young nobleman, and an expert swordsman.  He itches for a chance to test his skill against the best in the land.<br/><br/>Queen of Diamonds: Aliea is an advisor to the Emperor.  Though she wears the garb of the Nameless, and claims none of her former identity, forgoing even her name, she is often present at high-level meetings, and has a strong voice in the Emperor's war-council.<br/><br/>King of Spades: Beatrice, a serving-woman at the palace, is sentanced to death for refusing to go to the Emperor's bed.<br/><br/>Aces: Aces are a special case.  Come up with a previously unknown rule, and then refer to the suit to find the character's relationship to the rule.<br/><br/>So the idea is that you get a whole lot of characters with kind of intertwined fates, different stakes in the culture.  I think it's an interesting way of doing "show, don't tell" in a fantasy game, where the culture, and how it works day-to-day, is revealed by the characters the players meet, rather than dictated from on-high.  If nothing else, it's a great prompt for imagination.  These characters were all thought up on the fly as I was typing this, but I'd be happy to have any of them in my games.  I like how they really act as plot-hooks, but they're plots that are firmly rooted in the culture.   So often I think fantasy cultures are treated as this monolithic thing, where all members of the culture adhere to a set of guidelines unerringly.  What I like about this idea is that it introduces the complexity and moral ambiguity of real cultures, without endless complications to the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172717/#Comment_172717" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T20:03:53+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  8:03PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/images/macro/awesome.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172718/#Comment_172718" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T20:04:13+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  8:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great generator, Simon.

My mistake.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite><br/>Does anyone have thoughts on what makes good and interesting cultural rules for this purpose, and what makes bad ones? Or is just about anything good?</blockquote>\nThat's a really good question.  I think there are definitely some rules that are easier to turn into interesting NPCs than others.  It's something to do with how absolute the rule is.  I found the "Tribe of professional guards, known for absolute loyalty" really easy to use, because it's easy to find the place where it's twisted or broken by an NPC, and easy to see how it can affect someone.  I found the "Women always get first pick of food" really hard, because it's harder to see the places on which that rule can revolve, if you know what I mean.  <br/><br/>That said, I don't know that the more difficult rules produce less interesting characters.  I guess it's something that takes a little use to find what kind of rules work for you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172742/#Comment_172742" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T03:22:43+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  3:22AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2008 3:23AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a quickie I put together for 3:16:<br/><br/>2.

What? Where do they get it from? What is good food? What rituals do they have around eating? <br/>2) How do they deal with sex, children, and the family? <br/>3) What do they believe about the nature of the world, gods, or life after death? <br/>4) How do they deal with the basic changes of life (birth, death, adulthood vs childhood, etc)? <br/>5) What nifty little external signifiers do they have? Like lucky colors or numbers?<br/>6) How do they socially stratify and deal with power in structure? <br/>7) What is their relation to their physical environment and situation? <br/>8) What real world cultures am I thinking of, and how close should I stick to them? <br/><br/>As you can see, some of those got pretty direct answers. Others got indirect or partial answers. Some I didn't really answer at all, but poked around the edges of. If I was writing a novel, I'd fill that shit out a lot. But because its for a game, I figure the parts that are important will get filled in through play. All I need for now is some tags that stick out for players to grab and yank on as we get going. <br/><br/>Anyway, that was my basic thought process.<br/><br/>As for how many people break rules... it might be tricky in a Sim game where you want NPCs to match proportions of folks in the world. However, in a story game, where you're going to focus on characters rather than people in the world, I don't think it needs to be a problem. Like, in the Wire (our world) how many of the characters followed all the rules of their culture? (Off hand, I can't think of a single one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173107/#Comment_173107" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T22:40:58+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 10:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the probabilities thing, I wasn't concerned that people wouldn't be representing "the majority".

Show that!</blockquote>\nAbsolutely! What this technique grew out of is my belief (founded on an academic background in anthropology) that culture is not a hard and fast set of rules and beliefs - it's the collection of opinions and practices and excuses and stories that surrounds those rules and beliefs.  In other words, the "culture" is not the set of twelve rules - it's the characters you generate out of those rules.  <br/><br/>Think of our own world.  We have a "rule" that says "marriage is forever", and yet for a large number of people, that's not true.  The rules are not about what the majority of people do in the setting, they're about how people feel about what people do.  <br/><br/>Brand, I really like your list of things to think about when making a list.  I think there is a bit of a trick to making rules that feel "real", or at least that feel like real people could follow them.  I'm really interested in what goes into creating that feeling, and I think your list is a good place to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173121/#Comment_173121" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T23:55:01+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 11:55PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice!

Yea, totally. Of course, I think you've got to do the same thing with characters that do follow the rules. Especially characters that follow the rules too much. Because we all know that guy, right? The guy that will never speed, never go shopping on Sunday, never miss mass, never leave the bathroom without washing his hands without soap and water, never cheat on his wife, never fail to salute the flag.... that guy, oh that guy is annoying as fuck. Cause culture is about how much we break the rules, just as much as about how much we follow them. <br/><br/>I also think how the culture relates to rule breakers or twisters is going to depend on the rule and the culture in a way that isn't necessarily going to come from the generators as they stand. In any culture there are some rules that can be broken fairly easily and without consequence other than people thinking you're odd. But there will be other rules the breaking of which may get you killed, stoned to death, buried alive, shot in the back of the head. <br/><br/>Like, say the culture has a rule that people should be virgins until marriage. And someone you generate is a rake, and s/he sleeps around. Do others think s/he's a sexy rebel? A disgusting slut? Want to get with that? Want to kill 'em? Chances are all of those reactions will be felt by different members of society -- but which ones get acted out most? In the early 90's highschool the sexually active cheerleader is loved by some, hated by others, wanted by many, respected by few. In 2000 Afghanistan a girl half so outspoken and sexually free may well get stoned to death. <br/><br/>So, when GMing this stuff I think you also have to have a sense of the ways in which individuals in a culture react to violations of the rules, and how serious any given rule's violation is likely to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173209/#Comment_173209" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T10:58:39+00:00" title="October  4, 2008 10:58AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, exactly.

Also, the very reaction itself is an element of the culture. Like, is the culture forgiving of trespasses around sexual rules but not around trespasses around rules about food? ("You can fuck my son, but let me tell you, if you ever dare to touch my haggis again, I'll gut you!") Does it deal with violations of norms with confusion, isolation, removal of resources, or violence? ("She's a woman that wants to be in the guard? Well... let her, I guess, but pay her half as much.") <br/><br/>So once you start getting into that level of things, you have a real chance of getting into the guts of the culture -- especially the parts where the culture is divided against itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173481/#Comment_173481" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T09:12:12+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  9:12AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite>Here's a quickie I put together for 3:16:<br/><br/>2.

As such, it's a bit different from what I would use in my own home campaign (whether 4E or whatever) or in a much more specific product, rather than the very general one that HBC is, laying out the overall principles.  I'm hoping, at some point, to be able to put together something (maybe even as a OBE product) that really pushes harder on Simon's original concept, which is much more about how a single culture is composed of heterogeneous individuals, rather than various subcultures and factions and whatnot.  But you're right that HBC, right now, is basically a kind of halfway compromise between 4E and this thread.  In my mind, that's still a serious improvement as far as 4E is concerned and, considering where D&amp;D is coming from in regards to culture, it's not surprising, I don't think, that it may take us a few steps to get from monolithic cultural entities to something that looks more like real life.<br/><br/>In any case, I don't mean to be defensive about HBC, just to clarify what our intent was and what we may still do in the future with it.  Honestly, if HBC is leading people to this thread (which got a flash of attention and then disappeared off the radar), that's a strong success in my book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188013/#Comment_188013" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T06:16:37+00:00" title="January 13, 2009  6:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...

You play a different dwarf not by having a different relationship to dwarven culture but by having a different dwarven culture.<br/><br/>(I admit I was not so interested in how to hack 4e to create different bundles of racial traits as how to intepret racial traits into cultural profiles and what different choices there are - e.g., at the point of exampe of how Wisdom bonus could = wariness for elves noting a different spin would be Wisdom bonus = oneness with surroundings [both fitting better Perception] and thus different possible cultures for elves.

Simon's insight opens up a lot of different possibilities and I'm excited to continue exploring further down this road.<br/><br/>As Andy says, I've bookmarked this thread for life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188111/#Comment_188111" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-13T12:24:20+00:00" title="January 13, 2009 12:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The nice thing about this generator is that it sets up a very HeroQuest kind of social issues- you put together the parts of the culture and stress them.<br/><br/>Easy topics:<br/>- Sex/Gender roles<br/>- Class roles (who's in power?  who's holy?  who's shit?)<br/>- The biggest virtues/who do we look up to?<br/>- The biggest flaws/who do we condemn?<br/>- Duties (by choice, duties by birth, etc.)<br/><br/>Drop 13 of those in and you have a nice brew waiting to happen.

It reinforces the view that a culture is just a grab-bag of random elements, which is certainly a view that some have held, but I really take issue with. Then again, I also really agree with Tim Ingold and the issues he raises about our whole notion of "culture," so I might not be the right one to ask. A culture isn't just a random collection of beliefs, customs and artifacts, it's a set of traditions that adapt a particular people to a particular ecology. I think there could be a good little game you could play out to create a rich culture that started from that premise--I'm trying to work out something like that for my own game--but I don't think this is it. I don't think this creates culturally rich NPC's--I think it creates a random set of beliefs, customs and artifacts.

I probably didn't do a very good job of explaining that. For instance, Simon uses the rule in his OP, "People wear blue for mourning." Why? What is it about blue that makes it something people wear for mourning? In real cultures, these things have reasons behind them, reasons that come from the way people dwell in a given ecology. That's really critical to creating a realistic culture.<br/><br/>I can see this method producing the illusion of culturally-rich NPC's, and that illusion may be all you need, so long as you don't press the matter too much. But my first reaction when I read this all the way back when Simon posted it was, "There's a better way to do this." I don't have that better way nailed down, so I kept quiet--like I said, I finally listened to my mom--but it's something that's bugged me about this thread, and <em>Hard-Boiled Cultures</em>, every time it's come up.<br/><br/>You made the comparison to dungeons, and I think that's apt. I think this is kind of like your typical random dungeon creator. Compare that to <a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to Host a Dungeon</a>, which would be something more along the lines of what I'm envisioning here. Yes, a random dungeon creator could create the illusion of a complex dungeon, but if you think about it too much, you'll start to see all the holes and the dungeon won't make any sense to you. Whereas "How to Host" ages a dungeon bit by bit, to create something that can hold up to some scrutiny. Likewise, I don't think the "culturally-rich" effect this method creates goes very deep. I think there's probably a much better way to do this, by creating a game that starts from the ecology, and begins modeling different phases of adaptation, to build up something more coherent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199629/#Comment_199629" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T22:12:49+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 10:12PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So okay..

The showcase isn't "a culture" (which is a thing which some anthropologists might argue doesn't exist) -- its characters who interact with a set of relative cultural norms. The way those characters will interact with each other will then bring out deeper cultural mores, and possibly get players looking into how and why the rules work. <br/><br/>I'ts great cause it's more or less natural for folks who aren't anthropologists. I mean, I've never interacted with a culture in a direct fashion. But I have interacted with people who are part of a culture.

And yes, it could just be a way to showcase a culture--but again, that randomness just keeps on irritating me. Even to showcase it, there should be a better way than just pulling them at random. And please note, I'm choosing my words carefully here. It irritates me, it sticks in my craw--it may be just my problem, and the idea's just dandy. And I wouldn't say anything stronger than that; I wouldn't say I hate it or it's terrible, it just ... irritates me.<br/><br/>I do have a B.S. in anthropology, and do a lot more reading on it than your average B.S. in anthropology generally does, and yes ,I'm even one of those aforementioned types who read Tim Ingold and thinks the whole notion of "culture" rests entirely too much on a particularly Western, particularly Cartesian dualism which might be fine for understanding how <em>we</em> live, but becomes an enormous obstacle when dealing with how <em>other</em> people live.<br/><br/>I'm working on a system in my own game that creates a "culture" and "culturally-rich" characters (I'm quoting because of my issues with the idea of "culture" here, not Simon's OP) in a more "Ingold-ian" way, you might say, building up from the landscape. But I don't have anything fully working yet, just a bunch of ideas.<br/><br/>I guess if there's any value to my curmudgeonly whining, it's just a caution that this seems to still have some problems with it and not to become complacent or think this leaves the whole "culture" thing solved, though it may well be an excellent improvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199814/#Comment_199814" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T17:17:14+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  5:17PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, on second thinking, what if we took this to another thread?

(I don't have a degree in anthropology, but I did take more classes in it than was good for me.) <br/><br/>The other thing I think is worth considering is the role of the players in creating culture as they play. For example, you raised the issue earlier of "why is blue lucky" when you've come up against a random seeming rule about blue and luck. There are, obviously, a lot of ways to deal with that. One of the ones that I have some fondness for, when dealing with fictional cultures, is having those actually playing the culture find ways to invest and discover meaning in it. <br/><br/>That is to say, we're in a situation where we know blue is lucky, and we know other things about the culture, and suddenly in play we realize that we want to know why blue is lucky -- what are the myths around it, what is the tie to the plastic world, the economic situation, etc. We as a group then figure it out, as play goes, in a way that joins the creation of the "culture" in play with the "culture" at the table and the joint mythology that we're creating. <br/><br/>Thing is to do that, it helps to have a good structure: lists of questions, concerns, typical cultural patterns to emulate or mutate, etc. Since you're already thinking about this, and have the degree and everything, could you maybe toss some ideas for those back and forth with me? Like, when I'm starting to work out cultures as I go in play, what should I keep in mind?
