I was getting in a slump for a while and not feeling it as much, but this game is great. It seems more like OD&amp;D than any game before, for a multitude of reasons.<br/><br/>Jason posted about a game I ran before at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6581" rel="nofollow">Killing Kobolds and Not Taking Their Stuff</a>. We continued that adventure this weekend, and I'll talk about that in a moment, but first:<br/><br/>My D&amp;D 3.5 group has had trouble meeting. There's five of us, and every Sunday one of us would have something come up. It was getting so that we weren't going to play at all. With D&amp;D 4 coming out, I decided to reboot with something awesome. Ben Robbins' <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow">West Marches</a> idea had always struck me as a good one. He made a sandboxed world where the players could decide where to adventure each game, and whatever players decided to meet would play. I'm going to let go of the expectation of a regular party, and instead have the idea of a world with people whose adventures intersect.<br/><br/>We started that this Sunday. We're continuing through Keep on the Shadowfell, but I've woven it into the Frozen North, the area our 3.5 campaign was in, and the area I'm using as my sandbox. We had characters shift during the game, as one group had a fight with Irontooth and got pasted, and then one character who was separated from the party - he wasn't being played - came back to town looking for his friends and found them missing. He gathered two people in the tavern - two new characters - who went out to find them. Of course, they got pasted, too.<br/><br/>This made Keep on the Shadowfell run really well, actually: all of them have been brought to the Keep as sacrifices to open the rift of Shadow. They've escaped and are near the entrance - whoever isn't being played next time are going to run back to town to get help and supplies, which is perfect. In the future, we're not necessarily going to have continuing stories like this, but I wanted to run through the entire Keep.<br/><br/>I'm really excited about this plan. As a DM, the chance to build up a world and let people explore, and then generate a larger story that different groups of players each find parts of to put together when they meet is totally awesome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149051/#Comment_149051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:53:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The shifting-characters in and out idea is great.

This means that if your gang is gaming 2-3 hours a night, it's going to take 4-6 sessions for them to finish up.  (Interestingly, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure is now about the same length of a season on Primetime Adventures).<br/><br/>The chief advantage of the West Marches game is that there's no trouble scheduling a game; the disadvantage is that you can't guarantee having [i]any[/i] of the same participants from one session to the next, which could be strange.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149381/#Comment_149381" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T13:36:33+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  1:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James,<br/><br/>True enough. I'm a big fan of the rules as written, and don't want to change much, if anything, but I do hope to use Skill Challenges for all non-climatic battles (I'd expect 6 or 7 out of 10.) I'm going to try this out next game to see if it'll work. If so, that should speed things up. We play for 4 hours, and I'm hoping they'll finish a short excursion each time.<br/><br/>The Skill Challenge for combat idea is pretty good, I think. I was re-reading the rules this morning, and it seems like you can have the same sort of battles you had without a game mat, in that you describe the area, and maybe draw some on a dry erase board, and describe actions. I'm going to let people use their powers, if described well, to gain bonuses on rolls in these, too.<br/><br/>- Clinton                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey" title="VacuumJockey"><img alt="VacuumJockey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey">VacuumJockey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149525/#Comment_149525" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T02:15:07+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  2:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 2:15AM by VacuumJockey.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A great idea, but then again, I'm biased towards sandbox campaigning.
