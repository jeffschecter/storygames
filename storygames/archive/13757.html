Angry characters shout. Sad characters look sad. We act pastiches of emotion.<br/><br/>The problem is: there's little truth in these stereotypes. Try observing yourself next time you're angry. Chances are you won't shout: you might speak tensely, but you'll try to keep your voice under control. If you're sad, you might try to look happy or become withdrawn, but you probably won't look downcast.<br/><br/>I think that, if we acted better, we'd make our games more interesting and affecting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311411/#Comment_311411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T05:05:29+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  5:05AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember reading once, I'm not sure where, that the best way to act drunk isn't to try and pretend to be drunk... it's to try and pretend to be sober.

In a gaming context, being a great actor is less about turning in an Oscar-worthy performance of outstanding verisimilitude, and more about giving your fellow players something they can recognize, appreciate, and fit into their imagination.<br/><br/>Context matters a lot here.  If you're playing at a fast tempo with a lot of momentum built up in the scene, I think going for the easy stereotype <i>works</i>: it lets everyone at the table grab onto the important information ("his character is REALLY ANGRY!") and keep moving forward.  It's more about providing an appropriate and swift cue for them to react to than anything else.<br/><br/>But in a slower scene, I think you can engage your inner Laurence Olivier and go for subtlety and accuracy, with great results; if you're seriously going for immersion, our brains are wired to read subtle emotional cues from other people, and the advantage for targeting your performance at that instead of just waving the big stereotype billboard is obvious.  We have a gut reaction to someone who seems genuinely furious or distraught that we just don't get from Angry Yelling Guy or Boo-Hoo Boy.<br/><br/>So I guess I'm taking a middle course here:  I think it's absolutely worthwhile to improve your performance skills and be a better actor at the table, but at the same time I think that some moments in the game are best served by using easily identifiable (albeit inaccurate) stereotypes.<br/><br/>edit: cross-posted with Graham, and I totally agree with what he says above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311420/#Comment_311420" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T05:54:28+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  5:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 5:55AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Immersion isn't too far from acting.</blockquote>I've reason to believe otherwise. Immersion is me, the player, tapping into my intuitive understanding of what a human being is, forming a character around <i>my understanding</i> of how to react and act in specific situations. Acting is being given a preposition of a character you are asked to portrait, and then setting about doing that character as described.<br/><br/>I started thinking on this some years back, when I had the chance to watch and talk with four people being "monks" on a middle-ages festival in Oslo. Two of them were larpers, and two of them were actors. There were no difference in performance between them. But; he actors got tired a lot faster than the other two. Each 30 minutes the actors had to rest, being totally knackered by the effort of so much improvisation, while the two larpers where playing on, shaking their heads in wonder over the actors. It made me think a bit about the differences in <i>method</i> between role-players and actors. I had to conclude that there is a real difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311421/#Comment_311421" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T05:56:50+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  5:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your role at the table is also important.

If you want to be "in" character, talk in-character, and show more than tell then dramatization is much more appropriate.  That's why acting developed as a skill, to better portray and communicate the internal state of the character.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you like to roleplay in the third person with lots of description of what your character is doing, asides to describe what they are thinking, and, in general, if you like to tell more than show then this technique should add some real variety to your scenes.  If you describe trying to keep your cool when your character is upset, or act like you're keeping your cool to mess with observers, you will go a long way towards adding immersiveness to scenes you are involved in.  <br/><br/>Don't forget, when most people are upset they shut down.  Be it shock, anger, horror, or awe.  It takes exposure, practice and/or training to overcome this.  Ask yourself, does the character in question have practice, training, and/or exposure to the situational elements?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311424/#Comment_311424" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T06:34:12+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  6:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing to consider:<br/><br/>What's the difference in how someone who is habitually angry expresses that anger, versus how someone who is almost always calm and collected expresses their own, rarer, moments of anger?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311426/#Comment_311426" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T07:00:27+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  7:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Yes, I agree with you Graham.

Then there's the game itself - playing through Fiasco with two other players, I found that almost comically exaggerated characterization both kept the pace of the game moving and allowed us the freedom to be reckless with our characters; something that Fiasco very much wants. I routinely play in a DnD group that prefers to ham it up a bit, and use fourth-wall-breaking meta-information in their verbal dialog. It's just how they roll.<br/><br/>When you do find a group that you can play an intense psychodrama, that's rare and special and to be treasured. This is the problem I had with A Penny For My Thoughts (full disclosure: which I own, and is amazing). The game really needs people who are willing to be serious and that you can trust to be on the same page as you narratively speaking. Same with Grey Ranks (full disclosure: which I do not own, and am unsettled by).<br/><br/>In any case, I do hope you find players that can play the social angle.

I think there's an important difference between what constitutes good acting for the stage, for the screen, for the workplace, &amp;c., and for the game table. I'm concerned about the difference between encouraging and elevating the skills of players and creating just another vector for Doing It Wrong in play. <br/><br/>That is, I've seen players withdraw from a valid creative decision because they don't think they could pull off the performance they'd want their character to give. I think the writerly and directorial decisions (e.g. "This character should be angry now," or "This character displays a level of rage that is uncharacteristic or downright odd for the circumstance.") are sometimes more important to communicate than the performance is important to capture. Sometimes it's better to communicate with your other players as collaborators, and then perform some shade of your intent, than it is to count on your acting alone when, really, many of us are not great actors.<br/><br/>The player says, "Gronk goes apeshit. 'What the <i>hells</i> do you mean we're going to let these kobolds keep their idol?!' You haven't seen him this mad since his hireling died. His eyes flit over to the cave mouth, where the kobolds are tied up." There's a lot of information in there, a lot of cues and suggestions that might get lost or go unnoticed without the narration, while the wizard is opening his third beer or the thief is shaking the empty crisps bag, you know?<br/><br/>So, yes, we should be curious about acting and its skills in much the same way we should be curious about writing and its skills, and various other skill sets that intersect with our play. It's a wonderful and wise piece of information\u2014that yelling is merely one way to convey anger\u2014to be sure. But what constitutes good acting at the game table is bar to be raised or lowered at each table, right?<br/><br/>Informing decisions about acting for roleplayers is a great subject for a book, though. I'd love to see more ways that acting can merge and blend with narration to form the kind of hybrid text that we use at the game table, not quite improv and not quite poetry or prose. I'd love to hear more advice that adds tools to the kit for the roleplayer as performer.<br/><br/>Thus the player can also say, "Gronk goes real still. He looks the wizard right in the eyes, his gaze unmoving while he quietly says, 'We're not letting those kobolds keep their idol.' That wasn't meant for the kobolds to hear." The player is still <i>showing</i>, because some things are left unsaid outright, but it doesn't depend on the ability of the player to pull off the performance he or she wants to see from her character.<br/><br/>I'm also a big proponent of players (e.g., the GM) asking each other questions about each other's performance, during play. This would absolutely beat to death a performance intended for the stage or screen, in my experience, but the game table isn't quite a stage.<br/><br/>tl;dr:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Your pastiche may be my shorthand, Graham. This may tie in to the discussion of immersion - are we performing? Are we collaborating? What's going on? If I have to communicate<i>my guy is angry</i>to four other people instantly, subtlety is not that useful.<br/><br/>Maybe the need to communicate instantly is part of the problem, though... I know I thrive in a culture of intense, short-run, time-limited and conflict-heavy play.</blockquote>\nI think Jason may have said in seven sentences what I chose to go on and on about for an eon.

I think a distinction needs to been made between encouraging good acting--which is a professional skill that, like any other, requires lots of training and education--and encouraging more complex role-playing. The former is, I think, just as potentially alienating as asking that your players be able to perform complex math or memorize large blocks of information. Also, just like those expectations, expecting your players to give professional (or even college theater group) level performances has the real potential to create a nasty hierarchy at the table.<br/><br/>The latter, meanwhile, just means using the skills that you do possess and the training that you do have to approach the game's theme or scenario with greater depth. This is what we need to be pushing for, I think, and not necessarily a high quality of in character performances.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>That is, I've seen players withdraw from a valid creative decision because they don't think they could pull off the performance they'd want their character to give.</blockquote>\nI do this, and it got really bad after we started recording our sessions to post actual play reports online. I started thinking, "I want to play this type of character, but I don't think I can do the accent/tone convincingly," and I feel like I missed some role-playing opportunities as a result. I've pushed to have actual play dropped from our podcasts in the future--they came out sounding terrible anyway--so hopefully now I can go back to playing without stage fright.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311514/#Comment_311514" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T12:38:16+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 12:38PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TheWhaleShark</cite>Someone clearly does not have an Italian mother.</blockquote>\nI was thinking that too! That is, there's a cultural element to how we express ourselves, what counts as appropriate or inappropriate. I've been watching "The Cake Boss," a show about a guy who runs a bakery in Hoboken NJ (traditionally a very Italian community--that's where Frank Sinatra was from), and they are <i>always</i> shouting at each other--the Italian mother of this ethnically Italian family in particular. Anger is <i>often</i> appropriate: "What are you crazy !?" shouts the mom at her 35ish looking son. "Riding a motorcycle at your age! You have responsibilities! You have a family!

I have to aim for efficient ways to play these roles. I don't classify these role elements between say sophisticated/subtle and simple/obvious. The guard captain might be a guy who yells a lot, it's a bit of a clich\xe9 but it's appropriate to this martial character and players will remember him for his burts of temper. <br/><br/>OTH for the King's heir who's a control freak and can't tolerate contradiction, I'll want to act how he's trying to keep his anger under control. I'll pinch my eyebrows/nose junction and close my eyes, or display a very fake smile while squeezing the back of a chair until my knuckles turn white. I always have the option to bypass physical acting with a snappy description when I want to speed up things. Switching smoothly IC and OOC voices is really useful too.  <br/><br/>To me subtle, obvious and OOC description work fine in their own time but there's got to be variety.

Observation is a vital part of acting (writing, too), I know, and it's one of the acting skills that gamers would do well to draw on heavily in their game-table performances and descriptions, in my opinion.

But just because I'm being a dumbass and playing emotional games does not mean that I'm not angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I don't shout Every Single Time I get angry. But, I'm a real person, so complex and contradictory.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, let's talk about fiction. I demand greater consistency from my fiction, including the fiction made from certain types of gaming, than I do from real life. And, it is sometimes important that my audience -- the other players -- understand what is going on, and there is often a time constraint. If the other players don't get it right away, it means that the mood I'm trying for won't happen, which means other things I want won't happen. Not a deal breaker, but if I want something to happen, I do what I can to increase the odds in my favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in a roleplaying game, this often means using shorthand. Not every angry PC or NPC of mine will shout. Some will get quiet. But, usually, I'll try to have any given character have predictable reactions. If one gets quiet when angry, that's probably what I want that character to do every time, for clearer signals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I may break character and say, "He sounds angry" or "You can tell he is angry" or "Make a Psychology roll. Made it? Okay, you can tell that, however calm he seems, he is seething with anger."<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I do better? Can I do more subtle? Often,not always.<br/>\nShould I? Sometimes. Far from always.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the sorts of larps I play, one principle that makes larping more fun for me is "If playing a villain, better to go down loudly and in flames than to be subtle and succeed." It's not a universal principle, of course. But, it often does make things better for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, in a larp where we had a lot of mini-larps within the big one ("Across the Sea of Stars"), I was playing a very, very evil person. I read my character sheet, and thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm. Ten to twenty minutes of this character. I could indeed play subtle, and possibly pull off a win. But, in that case, I decided to play a gloating, mustache twirling villain (without the mustache), explaining to the heroine how I was going to destroy her people utterly, and there was nothing she could do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it always have been the right call? No. But, for that player at that time? Yes. And, there was a definite feel of catharsis when her ally stunned the villain with a blaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nRealistic? Well, I would say that real villains aren't dumb enough to gloat and twirl their mustaches, even though I know that's not true. But, we were going for a certain feel. Oscar Rios's tabletop Call of Cthulhu scenario "Setting Sun, Rising Tide" had a very different feel, and a lot more subtle roleplaying. And, when the twist that the players knew was coming came, everyone thought long and hard about exactly how their PCs would react, making sure the answer felt right.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, both games were magnificent, each in its own way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311575/#Comment_311575" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T20:02:10+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  8:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 8:03PM by NomdePlume.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think roleplayers act too much, as it is. Marshall Miller mentioned players who describe their characters action, rather than acting them out - I much prefer that kind if roleplaying. I have difficulty imagining the kind of game where the players roleplay angry characters by getting in each others faces and shouting at them. I have heard tales of My Life With Master scenarios at cons where the GM played the master very physically, walking around, standing over the player, maybe grabbing them, stuff like that. That kind of physical acting is way beyond what I'd accept in a game (and I know one or two players who if the GM acted like that, would get equally physical back, even with the benefits of authority the GM enjoys).<br/><br/>So, I think acting can be too good, and too authentic - in a movie it's great, but for me, in a rpg, it has to be visibly inauthentic. Pastiche is good. Plus, there's nothing wrong with saying, "my character is angry," describing how this is expressed, and letting things go from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311601/#Comment_311601" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T01:31:48+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  1:31AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NomdePlume</cite>have difficulty imagining the kind of game where the players roleplay angry characters by getting in each others faces and shouting at them.

And I wouldn't advocate this type of role playing as regular usage or for any circumstance (yelling with strangers at a con would be very awkward for instance). I also value Graham's advice when he says in his book that when people try to act too much they stink. He's quite right about it. But there's probably a cultural preference reflected in his position there, and I wonder how our Italian and French members might feel about this advice for instance. <br/><br/>There's real value in players dropping the self consciousness and fear of rejection when they role play. Sure most of us are going to play just as badly as the "once a year" amateur performer. And also there's the stereotype of the GM as entertainer that rears its ugly head. But often, beyond comedian talent (or lack thereof), you will find that gut reaction can take over the rational mind. Every one's a critic right? Every body is going to judge how caricatural Adam or Beatrice are playing their character. Except there's something quite magical about people playing a role with conviction, or at least without fear or concern. I find it puts off balance our rational selves and let us tap into a more visceral type of role playing. I've seen it happen many times, without it becoming some psycho freak show, all for the benefit of the table experience. <br/><br/>Remember Graham is atypical here: everybody isn't a professional like him. Maybe he has a hard time dropping his analytical professional eye, but it might not be the same for others. And the thing is: enthusiasm is contagious. Two friends at the table start to play in a very involved manner and it may spark it for the rest of the table. <br/> <br/>Master Sifu says "When you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate... you stink." Sifu and Graham are really right, concentration makes you stink. their advice is to not overdo it and act as natural as possible. That's one way to solve the issue and it works. <br/><br/>But once in a while, try the other way: play full guts and forget about how lousy your acting may be. Perhaps have a shot of whisky before to help you relax? If you're acting confidently it will spark another kind of game experience, I swear!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311642/#Comment_311642" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T07:38:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  7:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never been at a table where the acting has been criticised, except when people do bad accents.

I don't think the performance described strays too far from the source material.<br/><br/>But I think this brings up two larger points: 1) each group has its own standards about what is or is not acceptable and what qualifies as quality role-playing, 2) approaching play with expectations about acting quality--like thinking the behavior in the example above is "shit"--is likely to hurt your ability to enjoy the game and, if you press the point, likely to alienate or embarrass other players.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it is impossible for RPGs to make you a better actor, just as they can make you a better critical thinker or broaden your perspective or give you empathy for others or improve your ability to do mental math.<br/><br/>That said, I think there is a significant difference between self-improvement <i>through</i> role-playing and self-improvement <i>for</i> role-playing, with the former being a laudable goal for any game designer and the latter being a bit narrow as a personal goal and insufferable as an expectation for others.<br/><br/>(This is coming from someone who has too often been guilty of the latter.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311658/#Comment_311658" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T09:05:15+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  9:05AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I've never been at a table where the acting has been criticised, ...

The loudest players get most of the attention. So even if not all angry characters shout or sad characters cry... it's the most outwardly visible reactions, often exaggerated, that communicate the point quickest, clearest, and garner the most attention. <br/><br/>Whenever I would play a subtle character in a Call of Cthulhu Masters Tournament, I would lose. Whenever I would play a loud character, I would always win. And I noticed the same in LARPs (where there is no obvious winning or losing).

The way the rules are structured and how metagaming is encouraged, shy players don't get lost in the shuffle and are given extra confidence in play to express themselves without being loud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311699/#Comment_311699" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T11:25:18+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:25AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Really, guys.

It's almost like drawing parallels with comedians is a big no-no or something. When I started reading English speaking RPG forums I realized that there's some kind of taboo out there. I had to get explanations about the word thespian and the cultural baggage that comes with it. There's no equivalent taboo about acting where I come from. Maybe it's not at play for Graham at all, and I apologize if I'm completely wrong here, but I can't help but notice signs.  \n<blockquote>The main points are:<br/><br/>1.

Stereotypes are going to hurt your games, like say if you're using a silly Scottish accent when playing a dwarf without any thought beyond "that's what my friends do."   But realism/subtle play isn't the only way. Once in a while outrageous, caricatural, loud and excessive will do the trick better. Again, it's more of an issue for a GM who's got to portray many characters. It's good to make some of them pop by using cheesy/loud/obvious tricks because it makes the GM's job easier. The difficult part is to understand when too much is too much, but it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311707/#Comment_311707" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T11:34:37+00:00" title="February  8, 2011 11:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>1.

Maybe it says something about my formative gaming years that I just automatically associated roleplaying with acting -- the overlap between playing a character at the table and workshopping a scene or doing improv seemed kind of obvious.  I thought it was especially telling that out of all the people who tried out gaming when I was in high school, the ones who took to it the fastest, enjoyed it the most, and really put a lot of effort into making their characters' scenes hum were all theater geeks.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's more going on when you play an RPG than just acting, but the idea that acting has no place in gaming (or has nothing in common with it) still seems a bit weird to me.  I'd think that working on your acting chops would improve your play the same way working on your backhand would improve your tennis game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311773/#Comment_311773" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T16:01:24+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  4:01PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2011 4:02PM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure who has said that acting has no place in gaming (or nothing in common with it).

In practice, I like doing <i>both</i> whenever I can: both explicitly describing my character's emotional state to the other players, and trying to portray it effectively.

However, I've been embarrassed for some players who go for emotional or loud approach. So, I agree. <br/><br/>When in character, I pay more attention to what I say than how I say that. If you say "Man, you're not in charge any more. I'm calling the shots here now. So just take a fucking seat and enjoy the show.", you don't need to shout or speak slowly or have long pauses to sound angry or threatening. The "script" will do it for you. Being subtle or even monotonous in your delivery will allow you to say pretty wild stuff while still sounding natural. Even if the message is very apparent, the delivery doesn't need to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312526/#Comment_312526" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T14:59:12+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  2:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also really enjoy the sort of roleplaying where the intent is more to communicate than to portray. "You've never seen his eyes look so cold before," speaks volumes. Then you can act as much or as little as you want.<br/><br/>One danger of trying too hard to portray your character (especially through the portrayal of stereotypes) is the distancing from the other players. I've always enjoyed those games when the players were smiling at each other, giving each other high fives (or saying, "Awesome!"), and clearly communicating their enthusiasm for what was going on.<br/><br/>I've had several bad (or just uncomfortable) experiences where players tried really hard to portray a simple emotion, without taking time to communicate interpersonally. For instance, I've seen these two many times (although the first is much more common):<br/><br/>* You're playing a game. The player on your right keeps glaring at you and making disparaging remarks whenever you speak up. Is s/he actually pissed off at you, have you done something to offend them? Or are they just trying to portray that their character is angry? It sucks when you can't tell. A smile or a wink now and then (breaking character for a moment) would improve the game 300% in a situation like that.<br/><br/>* You're playing a game. The player on your left has this huge wooden smile on their face, supports what's going on loudly, and speaks very positively about what's happening in the story ("Another victory for the league of justice!"). Their portrayal is kind of... fake. Are they acting badly in-character, or are they pretending to enjoy the game (because their character is currently happy, and they're trying to portray that) while, in actuality, they're bored or upset or not having fun at all?<br/><br/>Same as the first example, I by far prefer when players spend more time "out of character", so the social cues are easily separated from the fiction that's happening. I suppose "method acting" could be done in a roleplaying context to great effect, but, man, it ain't easy to make that work, compared to the fun of collaborative story-telling that gets everyone excited and pumped at the developing fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312528/#Comment_312528" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T15:14:00+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  3:14PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2011 3:32PM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>One danger of trying too hard to portray your character (especially through the portrayal of stereotypes) is the distancing from the other players. ...<br/><br/>I've had several bad (or just uncomfortable) experiences where players tried really hard to portray a simple emotion, without taking time to communicate interpersonally.</blockquote>\nWell...again, clearly, that's awful.

You don't have to feel like your character does, but you want to show that character's feelings in a realistic fashion.<br/><br/>Sometimes I'm more about<i>channeling</i>emotions, or whatever it should be called when you feel what your character feels.<br/><br/>The first approach - portrayal - has, for me, led to more shouting (for instance when GMing "My Life With Master" in a physical way that it seems a lot of people would hate), compared to the second - channeling. When I feel like my character, I don't usually care if other players can see what I'm feeling.</blockquote>\nThe funny thing is that when you are channeling, most (non socially inept) people will totally see what you are feeling. (My Method teacher always used to tell us this: "You feel it and the audience will feel it." That is, you channel and the portrayal comes on its own.) On the other hand, portraying emotions (just by the sake of it) can be tricky (if you lack the proper training), so most people will be distracted by your (lousy) delivery and will not get the subtleties of what you are really trying to communicate.<br/><br/>Of course, not everyone is willing to channel (at least not in every case). And so describing (as opposed to "acting") how your character delivers would work like a charm. Of course, that works on a practical, cold and mechanical way. If making others feel is what you are after, then show, don't tell. (And, note the "show", not "scream, pound and explode".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13757/angry-people-dont-often-shout" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13757/angry-people-dont-often-shout" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13757/angry-people-dont-often-shout/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13757%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13757%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
