At the very least, they have something in common deep at their core: They are both tangible mechanics that reward players for something they do in the story; and they particularly reward you for getting yourself in trouble. Both of them act as markers of what players want to see in the game, whether good or bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Aspects=<br/>\n<br/>\nAspects are good in that they're very open -- there's no limit to the number of good aspects you can dream up, and taking advantage of them to get your bonus is pretty easy. All you have to do is show how your aspect applies to the situation your character is in, pay a Fate point and you get a +2 to your roll. If you're particularly creative, you can even pay a Fate point to make something happen, or to declare a fact about the story or setting and make it suddenly true. <br/>\n<br/>\nAspects don't only act as a way to spend Fate points; they're also a way to earn them: the GM will "compel" your aspect by offering you a Fate point to make your character get into trouble in some way related to that aspect. For example if your character has a "Greedy" aspect, and you walk by some possibly booby-trapped treasure in a spooky tomb, the GM can offer you a Fate point if you just agree to reach out and take it. If you say yes, you take the treasure, the Fate point, and also whatever consequences come along with that in the story. If you say no, you have to pay a Fate point to the GM to resist the temptation.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Keys=<br/>\n<br/>\nKeys are good in that they're more clearly defined, and more subtly nuanced. My favorite implementation of keys is in Lady Blackbird, where it acts as a sort of bonus and experience system combined. Any time you do something connected with one of your keys, you can get either an experience point or another die back into your pool. If you get into trouble because of your key, you get 2 experience points, 2 pool dice, or one of each. If you turn against your key, you get a whopping 10 experience points and your key is destroyed; but those 10 experience points are enough to buy two more keys if you like, or one key and one more advancement of another sort. Once you've destroyed a key, however, you can never take that key again.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Why I like keys better=<br/>\n<br/>\nKeys make take more time to write than aspects, and certainly take more time to describe all the different ways in which they apply to your character and the story, but that extra effort you put into the outset really pays off later on. You don't have to argue so much whether or not the key applies in any given situation because of the extra explanation that comes with it, and you yourself are in control over whether you want to follow a key into some troublesome situation (such as with a key of greed), or whether you want to just skip it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAspects, at least to a certain extent, take control of your character away from you and give it to the GM. It's not just the temptation of the extra Fate point that may make you want to take that treasure, it's the cost of one of your own Fate points to not do that thing the GM has asked you to do. Now, many players choose the aspect of Greedy because they want to get into this sort of trouble, so when the GM offers them this kind of Fate point reward, they'll happily take it. These players may also feel perfectly happy about paying a cost to resist their own aspect, because again, they willingly gave up that much control to the GM at the outset when they chose that aspect in the first place. These players will willingly compel themselves, and have fun doing it, even though it's a responsibility first given to the GM. But some players aren't comfortable with compels at all -- they feel as though everything pertaining to their character should be under their control and theirs alone, and the GM doesn't have any right to touch it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeys not only avoid this problem, by just letting you choose "2x reward vs. 0 reward," they also give you a big payoff for changing your character completely in a way that your aspects don't. The basic 1 point reward for doing anything related to the key drives the theme of that key into the story, the 2 point reward directs that theme towards more tension and excitement in the story, and the 10 point key buyoff drives your characters to grow and change according to the events, or to turn against such a reward and remain true to their original nature, whichever seems more rewarding for the players telling the story. It has all the advantages of aspects in terms of reinforcing themes and creating tension, plus the added benefit of promoting character change, while at the same time keeping the character completely under the control of its player.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease discuss.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284248/#Comment_284248" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T07:04:48+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  7:04AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David<br/><br/>Sure thing, I'll accept your points... if I ever find myself in the situation where I'm playing with folks who are vehemently opposed to any outside control of "their" character. I do think that keys are easier to get your head around because they are levers that each player controls for him or herself. The GM and other players might set up siutations that allow the player to hit those keys, but the choice rests in the player's hands.\n<blockquote>But some players aren't comfortable with compels at all -- they feel as though everything pertaining to their character should be under their control and theirs alone, and the GM doesn't have any right to touch it.</blockquote>\nI've successfully avoided that playstyle for ages: I ain't got the time or energy these days to cater for players who play like that. (Fair dues to them if they like that though, each to their own.) As such, I'll happily surf in either aspects or keys, and so will the folks I play with, which somewhat renders moot your stated benefits of keys.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Pete                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284251/#Comment_284251" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T07:15:01+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  7:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if your circle of gaming friends is all comfortable with giving up some control over themselves, then it's no problem. I'm just saying that keys are more universally acceptable, which is a definite plus.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, I would say that while I would definitely play a Fate game and have a blast getting compelled by a GM, I still *prefer* to have it all under my control. I would rather not have to pay the Fate point to resist the compel, but it's not a huge issue for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think personally the main issue is I feel odd taking control away from my players what I'm GMing Fate. Something about it just feels wrong. Perhaps my own group is just too traditional and I'm afraid they'll reject the whole thing because they're not indie enough. As I kept adapting my games with more and more indie influences, keys made instant sense to them in a way that aspects didn't, and I thought that was a pretty huge advantage. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething inside me says keys are more in-line with human nature than aspects, because each of us can only control ourselves in real life also; but there are certainly lots of different ways of understanding human nature, such that no one game mechanic could ever fit perfectly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284252/#Comment_284252" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T07:23:51+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  7:23AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>I think personally the main issue is I feel odd taking control away from my players what I'm GMing Fate.</blockquote>\nSince the players are the ones that write the Aspects, they are basically giving you a gilt-edged invitation saying "this is how I really really really really really want my characters to get into trouble and make mistakes, please provide me with the opportunity to do so."

Aspects ask you to be the agent of your character's success only, and turn agency of your character's troublesome side over to the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Adrian, you're partly right. The Shadow of Yesterday and Solar System only provide experience points when you hit your key. Lady Blackbird's addition of giving you the option of pool dice instead is an improvement, and it's this implementation of the key mechanic that I'm referring to here (note that pool dice are sort of an equivalent of Fate points in Lady Blackbird). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I suppose there could be controversy for both keys and aspects in some situations, except that keys have a lot more words with which to describe how and when they apply, which has helped me a great deal in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284259/#Comment_284259" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T07:52:55+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  7:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2010 7:55AM by Adrian P.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about self-compels?

Keys could act as flags for character traits you want to use against yourself and hope to outgrow or change through play; meanwhile,  aspects would be for more persistent character traits.  This way, you could convert aspects to keys if you weren't happy with the compels and wanted to develop your character while destroying keys could allow you to purchase aspects.  In the above example, you could destroy the addiction key to purchase the "former addict" aspect which could then be compelled occasionally but also invoked to counsel other addicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284262/#Comment_284262" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T08:14:51+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  8:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2010 8:18AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Aspects assume a GM needs to bribe players to do what they will want to do anyway if they are fun people.

You want to! You really do want to! That is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about: "Oh my god, is my guy really that Greedy? Would he really turn on his friend?!" And when you put up a chip to say "No, GM, my guy reaches down deep into his reserves, calls on every ounce of decency he has, and ignores the golden opportunity to rip off his buddy", that is a strong statement about the character, and everyone will remember it forever, whereas without the chip, if you just say "meh, no, he doesn't", that is lame as hell. And if the character is so exhausted, so run down by life that he doesn't have any fate chips to spend, that's exactly the kind of moment where a Greedy person would give in to their natural instincts and, even if they might not have wanted to if they were operating at full capacity, steal.  That provides you a natural drive going forward, to try to make it up to your friend, maybe cover it up to protect the friendship you really did value, and now you have a fate chip to do it with.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>Can you give an example of how this might play out?

The whole reason the "does my guy steal from his buddy" situation works is because you have assumed that you, the player, would never, EVER have asked yourself that question if a GM hadn't said "hey, here's an opportunity to steal from your buddy, do you do it?"  Its exactly for things like that, things you would never think of, that makes having someone else come up with the situation good.

The problem is that a player isn't always in that frame of mind. I think Jason's example just above your post actually illustrates the problem better than my own example. Sometimes a player is interested in the same sort of narrative development the GM is interested in, but sometimes he isn't. The compel gives the GM the power (indeed, encourages him) to push it his own way, to take the right to choose away from the player who created the character, no matter how the player is feeling at the time. <br/><br/>I guess, especially after reading Apocalypse World, I've developed a strong preference for the style of GMing that gives players really tough choices, but at the same time gives them total freedom to make those choices however they feel is correct. Fate seems to call for a different style, where players give up some control over their characters' choices in order to gain a different choice of whether the choice is worth their Fate resource or not. This second style hasn't been as interesting as the first one, in my personal experience.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And when you put up a chip to say "No, GM, my guy reaches down deep into his reserves, calls on every ounce of decency he has, and ignores the golden opportunity to rip off his buddy", that is a strong statement about the character, and everyone will remember it forever.</blockquote>\nNow this I see as a problem. If my spending a Fate point to resist my character's "Greedy" aspect, and this is a strong statement about my character that everyone will remember forever, shouldn't it change my character in some way? With a key, I may turn away from my greed temporarily just by not stealing from my buddy because my friendship is more important than my desire for the thing I want to steal, or I may choose to make it a revelatory experience for my character, when he realizes that friendship really is more important than greed, and he actually buys off that key, destroying it, and replacing it with two other keys, one about the importance of friendship, and one about manipulation perhaps, so that my character doesn't necessarily want to steal everything in sight anymore, but maybe isn't above convincing people to give him things. <br/><br/>As Judd points out, keys let me make that dynamic sort of permanent change for my character in any important moment, as I choose, without anyone forcing me to do anything. Aspects stay the same, even if I'm forced to pay a Fate point to resist them. I can change an aspect around once per session, but it doesn't have that same dramatic punch that a key buyoff has.<br/><br/>And, sorry in advance for being nit-picky with examples:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>GM: Why'd you make an illiterate barbarian if you wanted to try to read scrolls and cast spells?<br/><br/>PLAYER: I'm sorta fixated on casting this spell at the moment.

You chose the Aspect (and if it's not the first session, you decided to keep the same Aspect each session), and you choose whether or not you give in to the compel offered by the GM. The only time that latter part isn't true is when your character is so beaten down, so worn out, that they fall back on their worst habits and at best have to make up for it later. FATE is not a game where you get to have your character completely ignore all their flaws forever.  That's fine for some games. I've played in many D&amp;D games where having a character with any negative qualities would detract from beating the dungeon.  "Dude, of course the chained-up maiden down here is a trap, <i>the chained up maiden is always a trap!</i>"  There's plenty of games like that, FATE is not like that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kayfall</cite>If my spending a Fate point to resist my character's "Greedy" aspect, and this is a strong statement about my character that everyone will remember forever, shouldn't it change my character in some way?</blockquote>\nIt might, that's up to you, when you reach a minor milestone (which you do about once a session), you can choose to change that Aspect.  It's up to you. It's up to you. It's up to you. Not the GM, not the game designer, you. You decide to keep that Aspect, or change it, or whatever. The Aspect is your responsibility, one hundred percent. All the GM does is run the world in such a way as to provide interesting situations tied to your Aspects, both positive and negative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284291/#Comment_284291" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T10:25:50+00:00" title="August  4, 2010 10:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with Diaspora and LB were that aspects are one more thing for the already-busy GM to handle (in cases with no self-compel), whereas keys gave players something to look for.

In other words, I don't have to "juggle" both PC Aspects and NPCs because the NPCs have traction because they ping on positive or negative areas of PC Aspects. <br/><br/>As an example, I'm currently running a Victorian-era adventure/occult game and one of the character's Trouble Aspects is "How did he do that?"  The character is a former stage magician who gave up the stage when he decided it just got too easy to fool audiences.  Now when he hears about an impossible crime or illusion, he's Compelled to get involved and figure out How He Did That.  Naturally, the NPC that leaps to mind is a theatrical villain who has the Aspect "Naturellement, I am smarter than you."  I don't have to "juggle" the Aspect, whenever this villain shows up, adjusting his exquisite moustache, the hero is leaping to the fore and I'm taunting him extravagantly, and compels and invokes are flying fast and furious.  With no clear, explicit Aspect, I'm left in the "just roleplay it" department I would be in with, say, Call of Cthulhu, and there's nothing wrong with that, but having a motivation mechanic actually gives me a strong campaign design direction, which is a very good thing.<br/><br/>A Key that a player can choose to follow or not, that's good too, both of them provide good guidance in this area. Just as Key proponents say that players select Keys so they can engage with them, I say the same thing for Aspects. And in both cases, maybe you fucked up and you weren't as interested as you thought, so in both cases, you change things up.  Both, to me, are quite cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284298/#Comment_284298" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T11:09:08+00:00" title="August  4, 2010 11:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the grand scheme of things we're splitting hairs, for sure.

Plus the compel should never be - "You jump off the ship!" it should be "the ship is on fire, and you think it is going to blow soon so you should get off or do somthing to stop the fire quick!" Even better would be something like "The McGuffin is down below, unfortunately the ship if on fire so you have a very small window to get down there and back safely...." <br/><br/>Compels should never remove the choice to act from a player by dictating what they have to do, it should add a complication that makes a scene more interesting or provide a choice for the player to make. <br/><br/>So like the Barbarian with a conscience up above, that compel is weak sauce. I would go for something like "You see a crying orphan on the road, a victim of the villains you are chasing, what does your conscience demand you do?" That sounds like a fun compel and makes more of a Bang and less of a dick move by the GM to me. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284352/#Comment_284352" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T21:10:18+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  9:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love them both, and both have changed my games. <br/><br/>Keys (My prefered incarnation is the LB variety.)<br/>-Reward for playing your character.<br/>-Oriented toward motivations.<br/>-Advancement engine.<br/>-Engine producing game mechanical benefit for conflicts.<br/>-Mechanism for thematic statements encouraging and/or in the form of character change through buyoffs.<br/>-Relies somewhat on GM <b>support</b> for full effect.

Doesn't actually require GM <b>enforcement</b>. (Player centered by exclusively self compels, enhanced by GM assistance.)<br/><br/>The biggest difference for me is the fractal nature of Aspects and their universal utility in reinforcing theme/color/tone etc... When in need of a way to encourage playing to some narrative element, make it an Aspect. Can't do that with Keys. Aspect have the same effect on any scale. When in a human scale conflict like a foot race for the Aspect <i>Fleet-footed</i>, when in a god/ess scale conflict like compelling Job to forsake his faith with <i>My Life I Owe to God</i> Aspect, or even at a middle scale confict like two planet sized star cruisers about to do battle with <i>Ion Shield</i> Aspect: the effect is the same despite the difference in scale. Each means something at the level that it is used. In the end, Aspects just seem a little more flexible than Keys. Really, either could be hacked some by adopting the other's methods of addressing the game, like adding buyoffs to Aspects or cannonizing and promoting self-compels for Aspects, but hacking Aspects seems easier than hacking Keys. Keys could be hacked to make them closer to Aspects, but the fact that Aspects encompass more than motivations is a bonus above Keys. <br/><br/>I think a game could have both Keys and Aspects. They do slightly different things, even if they have significant overlap. I have not read Dresden Files, but it sounds like Aspects in that game have been organized in a way that makes some of them function a little more like Keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284387/#Comment_284387" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T06:42:19+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  6:42AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, has someone tried hacking Fate so that compels are free to ignore? i.e. Whenever the GM compels a player, that player can either ignore it at no cost, or take a fate point.<br/><br/>If anyone has tried this, did it work?

Plenty of practical talk at <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/halfjack" rel="nofollow">blue collar space</a>.\n<blockquote>Also, all of the compel examples in Diaspora (the first Fate game I've read, though not played yet) are of the form:<br/><br/>Player: I want to do X<br/>GM: Nope. I compel you to inaction. Pay a fate point or sit there stupidly.<br/></blockquote>\nYes, the examples are misleading, at least in part because most of the time they occur where we're describing using a mini-game as a wargame, where the role of the referee is reduced or omitted and so the variation of a referee's discretion is better distilled down to a simple mechanical outcome than left vague. However, this text also reveals my personal distrust of the compel system -- I think it's inadequately defined and results in inconsistent play from table to table, and a lot of that play is boring or aggravating, which successful tables find baffling but can't really explain why in a way that prevents the problem.<br/><br/>I didn't know I had a problem with compels while writing Diaspora though. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284403/#Comment_284403" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T09:09:51+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  9:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of stuff to respond to since I last had a chance to write on this thread, but here's a quick response to Halfjack: I was just listening to a podcast from "actual people, actual play" where they talk about the problems they had with compelling aspects and I was wondering what you might have been thinking or feeling when writing Diaspora. I know for my part, I've been really enthusiastic about Aspects and compelling for a long time, and I thought there was something wrong with *me* personally when I wasn't able to compel them in an interesting way as the GM. Only now, having been able to think about aspects in their relationship to a lot of other system mechanics, as well as the different ways games have tried to explain them, did some of the problems inherent in them become apparent to me.<br/><br/>Compelling aspects properly is kind of like "being a good GM" in a traditional RPG -- you have to really write books about it, discuss it a lot, and work hard to understand it. It doesn't come naturally to you the way that following a key might, and I think one of the main goals of game design should be to make its mechanics as instantly accessible to people as possible. It's SO hard to do that, but struggling one's way through it is just the path you have to take as a growing game designer.<br/><br/>Having said that, it could be that someone will be able to explain aspects and compels in just the right language so that they can become accessible to people, at which point even older games that reference them could suddenly become much more playable, even for new gamers (or people like me who have issues like we're talking about in this thread). Maybe the next step in this direction is a move as far away from Fate as Fate itself was from Fudge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284419/#Comment_284419" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T10:34:43+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 10:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 11:18AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, the old "I should be able to be good at this without working at it!" idea. It never goes away.  Of course people want cake with no calories, and free money.  Being a good GM is a skill and it is fun to develop your skills at a game. Michael Jordan practiced a lot of basketball.  Gary Kasparov plays a lot of chess.  It is not a mistake to create a game that calls on you to improve your skills to maximize your enjoyment.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think the Aspects language in Dresden is weird, I got it pretty much straight up, everything I say above is primarily from that version of FATE.  (The main thing in Spirit of the Century's FATE I had a hard time grasping was the role of stunts/powers in the system.)  I haven't read Diaspora all the way through so I don't know what the issue is there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284434/#Comment_284434" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:13:38+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:13AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I like about Lady Blackbird is that if you spend your pool dice back on a roll, and then fail, you get those dice you spent back, plus one. If you succeed, on the other hand, you lose whatever pool dice you spent, and you have to get them back either by hitting keys or by having a "refreshment scene." I think the mechanic feel just right in terms of encouraging people to spend points, and also helps make it clear how increased danger (from your failure on the roll) leads to more resource points for you to succeed next time. I wonder if Fate can somehow be earned through a failed roll of some kind -- for example if your GM offers you a fate point as a temptation for the negative side of one of your aspects, perhaps you can roll a skill to resist the temptation, then still get the point if you fail, but you don't get the point if you succeed; you just go on with what you wanted to do. If you like, you could even spend Fate points on the roll to make sure you succeed. <br/><br/>It seems like this sort of thing would solve some of the problems some people are having. Or is it totally a Bad Idea?<br/><br/>(JD: Maybe Dresden Files is "that game" I was talking about, which can expand our minds and make compels easily accessible to everyone. I haven't heard enough feedback on it to know for sure. Is there some way to quote a small part of the text for me, as an example of a really lucid explanation?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Why Keys are better than Aspects - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12663/why-keys-are-better-than-aspects/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Why Keys are better than Aspects - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12663/why-keys-are-better-than-aspects/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="My 2 cents, even though I've never played FATE.

It seems kind of weaksauce that I can't buy my way out of a compel, I might roll like crap on my "resist compel" roll.  I didn't do that, the dice did.  If you really want more player control over dealing with Aspects, this would be the wrong way to go.<br/><br/>I don't think there was any particular snippet of Dresden that I could quote that I can say "Yes, I get it!!!!"

FATE is my go to game when I do not want to make hard choices, it is my easy game. Possibly because paying a Fate Point to ignore making a choice and moving on is so easy to do - specially when that Fate Point is just one of many that will be flying around the table and if I want to get it back, I just need to suggest a different compel that is more interesting for me. Whereas playing something like BW or Sorcerer is nothing but difficult and hard choices both as a character and as a player.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284473/#Comment_284473" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T12:54:14+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:54PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>My 2 cents, even though I've never played FATE.

That said, I really like the fate point economy driving compels because it means people have to make a choice: be badass but manipulated or be less effective but protected.  <br/><br/>I think it's also important to look at the games as a whole and not just aspects or keys.    With keyed games, you get to spend the XP you earn by playing the key on other stuff, ignoring the key is in essence denying yourself the XP.  In FATE (or at least Diaspora and Starblazer Adventures) there really isn't any advancement outside of mucking around with fate points, so without the requirement of spending a fate point to resist a compel you aren't losing out on future advancement.<br/><br/>(Brief aside about BW mechanics vs. keys and aspects, beliefs and instincts work a bit differently: you're rewarded for playing towards and against Beliefs as long as the belief comes into play, and instincts work like compel-only aspects with some other stuff.  Both aspects and keys work more like character traits with a more complex reward system attached to them than they do beliefs or instincts.)<br/><br/>EDIT: Just read the arguments against GM compels on the VSCA blog and I'm somewhat in agreement.  I don't think that external compels should be dropped entirely, but I do think that they should be secondary to self-compels (so similar to how Burning Wheel gives rewards for getting in trouble via instincts).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284566/#Comment_284566" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T01:58:08+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  1:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cathexis</cite>If I compel an aspect on one of my players and they turn it down it's not a snub against me, it's a declarative statement that they have a plan.</blockquote>\n<br/>Well, it <i>might</i> be a snub against you.

From the first 20 pages you can see the 1-3 lessons each protagonist is going to learn over the rest of the book.  Your character has Key of the Manipulator.   Guess you'll try to manipulate the rest of us a bit, then one of us will call you on it and your character will suddenly realize the value of friends.  Learn the lesson, take the power up.  <br/><br/>Aspects have an aspect of bad writing as well.  When the character has an Aspect "Ladies Man", you know he's most likely going to be used by a female antagonist.  You're also pretty sure that at the end of the book he'll still be a ladies man (though you might be surprised).<br/><br/>For some reason, that later strikes me as preferable to the former.  I think because the former tries to pack too much emotion, change and character growth into too little time.   Which maybe could be countered by only allowing a Key to be bought off it had already been hit for an equivalent number of XP in play.

On the other hand, it is also a way to give mechanical heft to in game situations.   The GM is the character's common sense or inner nature saying "Don't go in there, its on FIRE!" (or "its SCARY!" or "don't try to jump that chasm, its really DEEP!" or whatever).    Sometimes the player thinks "Hell yes, this is important!" sometimes, not so much.  At the player level essentially he's choosing that the character will be vulnerable at some other part of the story rather than here.    (As someone pointed out up thread, many of the Diaspora compel examples are similar, so I may be influence from having read those recently.)    It is very important that it isn't just a slap down of the player's action though.  When the character's common sense says "Are you sure?", if he answers "no" he still gets to do something else. <br/><br/>Let me make it a question then.  How do you (do you?) as GM try to reflect the character's hesitations and uncertainties?

I've actually never GMed a FATE game, so I'm not entirely familiar with the nuts-and-bolts of setting difficulties for actions...but that's probably where I'd start when it comes to giving mechanical heft to a game situation.  Perhaps point out that there are environmental modifiers which make this a dangerous proposition (it's windy, it just rained and the rocks are slippery, and the edges of the chasm are crumbling -- you'd need to get at least 5 on an Athletics check to make it!); I'm pretty sure that you don't compel the PC with those modifiers as Aspects, you can just put them out there.  Then if the player thinks it's still possible for their character to make the jump, they can go for it; if their own common sense tells them that there's no way to get a result of 5 with absolutely no Athletics skill, they won't.  Or maybe they would, if they really wanted to explore what happens when the PC does something suicidally dangerous and fails, but that's a different issue entirely.<br/><br/>If I wanted to hit the <i>character</i> right in the uncertainties, I'd look for an Aspect on that character that I could use to pull them in a non-jumping direction; making it a choice between accepting a fate point to pursue a line of action that directly appeals to an Aspect on their character sheet, or paying a fate point to ignore that Aspect and continue on with the chasm or burning ship plan.  If they hesitate and agonize over the decision, then we just did something pretty cool; if not, at least they were given two clear, active, viable choices.<br/><br/>Another possibility might be to take it in the direction of an opposed roll.  The PC prepares to leap aboard the burning ship, but an opposing NPC sneers at him:  "Don't be a fool!  It's too late!" and pays a fate point to invoke "Ship On Fire" in a social or mental contest against the PC to add further weight to his argument.  The PC can concede, not jump on the ship, and collect a fate point; or the PC can say "But I must!" and pay a fate point to invoke whatever Aspects say that he must jump on board ("Reckless Disregard For Personal Safety" or "I Always Get My Man" or whatever) to give weight to his own side, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284648/#Comment_284648" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T11:19:06+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 11:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cathexis</cite>If everything is going well in your game, there shouldn't be too much social stigma around saying no to the awesome that is the GM. </blockquote>\nI think you misread me, I didn't mean the GM is awesome, I meant the GM's proposed idea is awesome (assuming it is).  Also, thinking again, 'social stigma' may be too strong, but if the GM suggests you do something because of an Aspect or Key and it is awesome and everyone thinks so, there probably will be some letdown for the others if you don't do it.  It's still your choice and I don't think you'll really be socially 'punished' for not doing it, but you'll be very much encouraged to do so.

The thought was that everyone was on roughly equal footing, statwise, and by default no stat was worth mentioning unless it was in some way exceptional. Any stat that a player wanted to pursue would be ranked on a three tiered system, for example, Strong, Stronger, Strongest. These were the first aspects, and after a little kicking around, we realized that these stats could be anything, and the wacky ideas started flowing (Drunk, Drunker, Drunkest!) and we realized the same mechanic could be used for almost everything that was not a skill. What's more, we had been sufficiently impressed with the 7th Sea model of charging points for drawbacks that this seemed a great way to reflect both the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The idea of phased based character creation had come out of some experimental games that had used cards to build characters, and it seemed to dovetail nicely with the aspects idea. The idea of the skill pyramid (originally a column) came out of a desire to keep people from spiking their skills without an escalating cost model. We threw all this together and were pretty pleased with the outcome, and in the end it made for a great game.<br/><br/>There were a few bugs that needed ironing out. In initial tests, characters bought skills or aspects during each phase, and it resulted in some odd unevenness in the characters. Aspects originally provided bonuses to rolls, which resulted in some really scary outcomes, especially in situations where characters could invoke multiple<br/>aspects<br/><br/>The idea of switching from bonuses to rerolls came out of a weekend of camping and considering games like Dying Earth and Trollbabe, which make good use of the mechanic. That and the idea of making aspects more central to character creation were the two ideas the final version of the game crystallized around.<br/><br/>Other bits have fallen into place since then, but ultimately, this remains the results of a crazy conversation about trying to tie story and character background a little more tightly to the mechanics.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285299/#Comment_285299" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T15:47:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  3:47PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question about Aspects: what happens if you have two that tell you to do opposite things?

And as long as the person making the compel is not a total dickwad then that person should roll with the new compel. <br/><br/>Always go with what makes the game more fun or interesting for all parties, and if you cannot see eye to eye on what those sort of things are then try to reach a compromise. All compels should involve communication between the players, if a compel is a lame snorefest, then say so and suggest something else!

"That was his vulnerability, do you understand? Being treated important. Which means he was gonna associate with people who would stroke him, and were important themselves. And in that vulnerability, once you go down that path and it goes unchecked, you add to it. Like, 'Oh, I'm drinking, who cares?' Then you start being a little whore, 'cause that comes with drinking. That's what corruption is \u2014 when you're too exhausted, you're gonna go with your weakness. So when we see corruption, we shouldn't say, 'They're all corrupt.'

(It tends to happen less as everyone gets more familiar with each other and with the characters, because then they're more likely to already know what compels will get the most traction.)<br/><br/>But I can imagine a situation where the GM has very strong feelings about why this particular Aspect must be compelled at this particular time, and is not swayed by the player's attempts to be compelled with a different one instead.  It's not that much different from a GM who opts to put particular monsters that a PC is weak against into a particular room in a dungeon: sometimes you just get presented with a situation you don't like and have to deal with it, and how you do that is actually the interesting/fun part of the scene.<br/><br/>(In moderation, of course; a game of nothing but compels you want to reject is as bad as a dungeon with nothing but monsters you don't want to fight.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12663/why-keys-are-better-than-aspects" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12663/why-keys-are-better-than-aspects" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12663/why-keys-are-better-than-aspects/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12663%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12663%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
