I'm just interested in the difference between non-interactive stories and games. I think we story gamers often think about gameplay as creating stories, and I've heard people say that you should always aim for creating a story you'd pay to go see on the cinema screen. But gaming and stories <i>arent' the same thing</i>, and I'm just curious to find what the differences are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189665/#Comment_189665" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T19:12:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  7:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once we had a complete gaming session of about 4 hours of solo play dedicated completely to selling a crystall ball.

It was actually the first time I'd ever pre-planned a scenario to play (which I had previously thought was really stupid and unfun), but there was no one in China to play with, so I was getting my roleplaying fix by plotting out this long, crazy thing called "Archangels of Wormwood" for RIFTS Wormwood, the greatest setting for the crappiest rulesystem ever.  By "long" I mean, like, 7 sessions that formed a tiny chunk of this huge narrative that I had in mind.  Previously, we also rarely played the same characters twice or played in the same location.  I mean, when you got the new RIFTS book, you just had to create a new character because the new classes were SO HOT.  Mining Borg OCC, I choose you!  And creating characters was a lot more fun than playing first level characters, y'know?  First level characters suck, but we never considered making ones of higher levels.  That would be cheating or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, so I come back home with this notebook full of story plot, basically.  It had no stats in it, aside from a couple of really cool magic items and powers that I had specifically designed for some Wormwood characters we'd played previously.  It was all just, "This thing happens and then the players go here and etc."  Railroaded out the wazoo, which I had also never really done before.  But the players (my brother and two childhood friends) ate that shit up, right off my spoon.  One of the characters got possessed by the Archangel Mikail (who I made up).  One of them ended up with a crystal virus (stolen from the Cable's T-O virus from X-Men) that he could control, which allowed him to do really cool things with his transformed hand long before Aquaman stole that schtick.  My brother's character... I think he maybe just got hosed, I don't really remember.  Anyway, it was great, but it would have made a really, really terrible story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189703/#Comment_189703" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T06:40:19+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  6:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2009 6:40AM by Graham.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played D&amp;D on Wednesday.

They pick up "Han" and "Chewie", but the conversation goes a little differently. The whole "And no questions asked" made "Han" and "Chewie" More than a little suspicious, and Obi Wan got especially testy when they started asking why they had to drag along the droids, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Han", who had maxed out his computers skill and had a week to kill while they were in hyperspace, decided to see what all the fuss was about with these droids. With a restraining bolt in place on R2D2, he hacks him and discovers the plan to the Death Star. Suddenly he knew why everyone was being so cagy. He also knew he was a dead man for helping these folks, reguardless of if he was aware of what he was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe keeps quiet about it and they get to what's left of Alderaan.  "What could have done this?" says Obi-Wan.<br/>\n<br/>\n"I Know exactly what did this, and we're getting the hell out of here." replied "Han."  They get buzzed by a TIE fighter, but instead of giving chase, they immediately jump to hyperspace.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly, they're never captured by the Imperials. Leia is not rescued. Obi-Wan is not dead. The Imperials don't know where the Rebel base is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were all very amused by this turn of events. It would have been anti-climactic as all hell for a movie, but we really enjoyed the twist it put on things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_189830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189830/#Comment_189830" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T00:05:10+00:00" title="January 24, 2009 12:05AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2009 12:13AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have virtually endless experiences with role-playing games that would be just plain impossible in any other media.<br><br>--&gt; Having the players meet a mother and her son, gathering firewood in the woods, capturing them and discussing how to stop them from raising the alarm of the army the characters were part of (the discussion of the players, the horror when they see that a quick kill is the only solution, the unease of it being themselves that had to make that choice, a player giving the order to kill, and the killing itself ...).<br><br>--&gt; Having the players themselves arguing with me as "a smiling and mild mannered old necromancer" at the court of a foreign tyrant, and their chagrin as they realize that the necromancer has better arguments than them!
