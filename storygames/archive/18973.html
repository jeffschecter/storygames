It involves creating a map of the world your characters play in, updating it as the characters' adventures progress.  There is a collaborative democratic way of progressing the stories via a super-fast secret ballot.<br/><br/>This is the UK's Indie RPG of the year.  Two years ago we gave you Witch.

It also gives each contributor dedicated time/permission to say 'now is when I'm going to narrate something big', the dedicated solo-narration time avoids 'design by committee' diluting the story.<br/><br/>Quests add a definite structure that keeps the stories consistent, encouraged characters to meet up/clash and keeps the pace up (which is good if you like fast pacing). Also, because you don't pick your own quest it encourages goals that the player may not have thought of.<br/><br/>So yes, those are the two main differences, and the thing they add is a bit more structure that shapes the game to ensure it is both dramatic and focused (which you may/may not need and may/may not like).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424195/#Comment_424195" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T09:22:59+00:00" title="November 14, 2013  9:22AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the final scene of the game I played I was in the position of narrating on the final crossroad of the game.

The other player narrated a happy ending.  During the vote I backed my own dark vision along with at least one other player.<br/><br/>I lost the draw.

My group really enjoyed the world-building of In A Wicked Age, so I hope they'll go for this too.<br/><br/>One minor question about direction: On page 22 it says <i>"The other duty of the director is to ask the other players questions about the scene and the characters in it. These questions are asked outside the context of the scene and must be answered by the <b>player</b> being asked."</i> Makes sense. But the immediately following example says <i>\u201cWhy do you no longer revere the spirits?\u201d</i>, which is a question aimed at the <i>character</i>, not player.

But the immediately following example says <i>\u201cWhy do you no longer revere the spirits?\u201d</i>, which is a question aimed at the <i>character</i>, not player. Maybe that should be revised to something like "Why does the tribe no longer revere the spirits?"</blockquote>\nYou're right, at least in the spirit of providing a good example it should be directed at the player, maybe <i>\u201cWhy does Bob no longer revere the spirits?\u201d</i> would be better (although a question about a whole tribe is fine, as is asking that question of someone who isn't playing Bob at the time).\n<blockquote>At a higher level, I'm curious how the quests affect the structure of the story.

Stories colliding and then separating also help weave things together even though the characters are on different quests.<br/><br/>Because of how you pick a character for each scene you actually have quite a bit of control over the pacing of the game which helps enormously in getting a satisfying ending for the session. Most games I've played at conventions manage to engineer a satisfying climax where the results of previous quests are reincorporated into the final scene.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424221/#Comment_424221" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T19:20:22+00:00" title="November 14, 2013  7:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The big differences I see are resolution (which feels less fun, in that 50% of creative input is going to be thrown out every time) and quests, but I haven't played - what's the secret sauce here I'm missing?</blockquote>\nI've only played Intrepid once but in practice that isn't how it played out at all, because what tends to happen is that the second suggestion tends to riff off the first - either by making it bigger or by pulling in a different direction.<br/><br/>I like that mechanic in a game (Penny and our home brew MC-less Monsterhearts does something similar) because it's collaborative without being effectively zero-sum.

Importantly you can't put a character on a Quest you created, but when you assign a character to a Quest you define a little about what there intentions are (i.e. "I am that princess" or "I need the gold to ransom my father, the King").<br/><br/>They have 3 progress markers on them, which are crossed off as <i>Crossroads</i> are reached (basically conflicts, although they don't have to be). If more people join the quest (not necessarily with the same agenda), one extra progress marker is added per character. Once they are all crossed off that Crossroads must give the Quest some kind of ending.<br/><br/>So essentially they ensure there is interesting stuff in the world, you interact with other people's stuff, the limited number encourages characters to have their stories intersect and they keep the pace of the game going (not too quick, not too slow).<br/><br/>Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings" title="SGTillings"><img alt="SGTillings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings">SGTillings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426758/#Comment_426758" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-07T05:56:48+00:00" title="January  7, 2014  5:56AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh man!

There's a game I really love called Land of Nodd which uses a similar path toward a fictional goal (breaking it up into Progress steps), but that sometimes gets hitchy, so I'm wondering how (if?) Intrepid differs.  <br/><br/>In Nodd, a Nexus (similar to your Crossroads) is called whenever a player character gets to the point in a scene where things either go their way or don't.  At that point, a resolution mechanic kicks in, and on a positive outcome, the character makes one step of progress toward their Goal.  The hitch I ran into is that it was not always clear what sort of fiction might count as relevant progress, so we sometimes ticked off a game marker without producing a satisfying fictional arc.  "How is my character now closer to ransoming the King?  I'm not sure, but I have one fewer Progress marker."  The real issue here may be scene framing -- simply establishing a clear opportunity for progress in the first place.  All I can say is that, absent guidance on that front, we sometimes found it easier said than done.<br/><br/>It didn't ruin the game or anything, it just wasn't ideal.<br/><br/>What's your experience with this dynamic in Intrepid?

It doesn't matter if the scene ends well for the character or badly, 'progress' is made either way. When you do your crossroad narration you can ensure something happens you would consider progress.<br/><br/>The game encourages movement around the map (and to invent new locations on the map) so progress is often as easy as finding out where to go next.<br/><br/>Basically it's not been a problem.<br/><br/>I have had problems with people framing scenes that ignore their Quest, which causes the structure of the game to break down and <i>then</i> progress markers are weird. That's a case of people ignoring the rules though, but it's easy for some people to do when they think about what there character would do next, rather than what would make sense for the Quest.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a> K: have you seen Simon Rogers of Pelgrane giving Intrepid an endorsement hear? <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-o0jbmHd-6ec?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0jbmHd-6ec"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/o0jbmHd-6ec/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span></blockquote>\nI hadn't seen that, thanks for pointing it out, Simon is always very generous with his praise of the game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Dave summoned me to this thread because <i>Land of Nodd</i> is my game, and it sounds like there are a few similarities!<br/><br/>I'll be curious to read more about this, and/or to play it.</blockquote>\nI've not come across Land of Nodd, where can I read more about it?

So it's quite natural that you don't know about it! It's a very old game by now (original playtests took place in 2006!). I'd be happy to send you a copy if you like - just PM me. The text needs a couple of updates at the moment!<br/><br/>Can you describe a situation where a player might have failed to provide progress during a Crossroads, but then the narration of this possible outcomes of the scene fixed that, as you write above? If you can remember something from an actual game, that would be fantastic!<br/><br/>In Land of Nodd, there is a mechanical incentive to framing scenes related to a character's goals, but, as Dave points out, it's not reinforced all that strongly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426843/#Comment_426843" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T08:35:55+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  8:35AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is no 'during a crossroad' that isn't narrating the end of a scene.<br/><br/>How it works is someone says "We have reached a crossroad" and the then 2 players (the framer and director, don't worry about what that means) each give a version of the end of the scene, then the group (kind of) votes on which ending should happen, the other is discarded.<br/><br/>There is no back and forth between players in the narration, no stake setting, no agendas either player needs to champion. Just 2 complete scene endings.<br/><br/>I can never remember specific examples from games but to invent something: If you spend all your scene chasing a pickpocket through a city when your quest is about retrieving sunken treasure a crossroads can easily crowbar in something relevant - you catch the thief and they promise you a map in exchange for their freedom, or maybe they get away but it turns out they were distracting you so a rival could leave port first.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426863/#Comment_426863" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T13:59:28+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  1:59PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you're saying that during the narration of the possible endings, each player makes sure to include something which is relevant to the character pursuing their goals?
