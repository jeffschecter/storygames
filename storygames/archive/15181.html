I admit that part of this could be my extremely analytical nature, which leads to me to ask you (anyone of you who know the LB system well) the following LB design theory questions:\n<ul>\n<li>What is the driving principle or goal behind a <b>key</b>?</li>\n<li>What purpose must a good <b>key </b>serve?</li>\n<li>What are some guidelines for creating good <b>keys</b>?</li>\n<li>What purpose must a good <b>secret </b>serve?</li>\n<li>What are some guidelines for creating good <b>secrets</b>?</li>\n<li>What mistakes should be avoided when creating <b>keys </b>and <b>secrets</b>?</li>\n</ul>\nI think my analysis has given me a pretty good idea of how to create traits and tags (even though it's hard to come up with helpful and balanced ones). I've also compiled a list of character attributes that fuel traits, keys, and secrets. (Things like trained abilities, talents, struggles, risks, motivations, and relationships, to name a few.) Some keys and secrets present themselves to me immediately, but it's the last 1 or 2 for each character that are difficult to nail down.<br/><br/>I realize that I'm looking for a somewhat systematic approach that may not be developed yet. I also wonder if John Harper intended to use keys in the same way as they're described in TSoY. It doesn't seem like it. I guess I wish John would have created a Lady Blackbird design guide (one can wish). And, yes, I have seen the <i>Lady Blackbird Companion</i>, but it's principles I'm looking for, not examples.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345010/#Comment_345010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T07:24:43+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  7:24AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2011 7:30AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The underlying structure of Keys and Secrets is pretty evident - there are only a few variations of each form, and if you look at a bunch of them it readily emerges. <a href="http://random-average.com/TSOY/DefiningNewKeys" rel="nofollow">Defining new Keys</a><br/><br/> <a href="http://random-average.com/TSOY/Keys" rel="nofollow">Keys</a>, <a href="http://random-average.com/TSOY/Secrets" rel="nofollow">Secrets</a><br/><br/>The main guideline as far as I am concerned is to steal and personalize.

Say you have the Tag "Impulsive", well, that character's player knows they have a 1-die bonus any time they're doing something Impulsive, right? You can have fun with that. I like Tags like "Explosions!" for certain action-oriented characters, to make them consider blowing things up more often, or hanging around situations where things might blow up.<br/><br/>* Some of the best Keys, I think, are those that pose interesting choices for the characters. Ask yourself for each Key: what kind of situation could this drive? For example, a <i>Key of Hatred for All Things Imperial</i> is interesting if one of the other characters has some link to the Empire (like Lady Blackbird), or whenever the group needs to pretend they're on the side of the Empire. But a Key like "Key of Sadness; hit this Key whenever your character is sad"... bah. I want interesting choices driven by these Keys,<br/><br/>* Make sure you have some Keys that encourage interplay between the characters. I like to ask myself, "When Character A acts on [this Key of theirs], how might Character B react?" Then give Character B a Key that makes that reaction interesting. Keys in "chain reaction" like this can make for interesting scenes!<br/><br/>* Good Keys can also suggest a story arc, via the Buyoff. Consider something like "Key of No Mercy", which encourages a character to be brutal and unforgiving. An interesting buyoff might be something like, "Forgive someone who has wronged you." It suggests a possible future where this brutal uncaring character has a change of heart and finds it in him or herself to forgive an enemy... which will almost certainly be a significant dramatic moment in the character's story as well as the overall narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/composertp" title="composertp"><img alt="composertp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tINibczPBx0/ToT_TX0gjLI/AAAAAAAAB_8/LRyRi1plPkw/s800/docsavage%252520avatar%252520white%25252032x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/composertp">composertp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345030/#Comment_345030" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T10:49:50+00:00" title="October  6, 2011 10:49AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thoughts, Paul.

For example:</blockquote>\nYup, <a href="http://www.johnzo.com/jedi-blackbird.pdf" rel="nofollow">Jedi Blackbird</a> steals a ton of Keys from other LB games too.  <br/><br/><b>composertp:</b> Keys enable you to engineer situation and premise.  Figure out the kind of play you want to provoke and encode it into the Keys.  Choose Keys that create an unstable situation, one where characters are at cross purposes with themselves or others, to make your situation gnarly.<br/><br/>Look at the way Lady Blackbird puts its romantic premise directly on the character sheets: Lady Blackbird loves Uriah Flint, but Captain Vance is infatuated with Lady Blackbird.  Kale Arkham has a bond of brotherhood with Captain Vance, and wants to get Lady Blackbird safely delivered to Uriah Flint ASAP.  If the players are hustling for XP then your premise will naturally be addressed and characters will come into conflict.  Think of it as enlightened railroading, if that helps. <br/><br/>Another example: I wanted Jedi Blackbird to be about Jedi wrestling with temptation, so I made the Dark Side attractive from a game mechanics standpoint and put a Key of Dark Side Seduction on all the Jedi character sheets.  The characters are going into a dangerous environment and have personal ambitions of their own in addition to their mission, so there is going to be temptation to engage the Dark Side and reap the XP rewards.  Who will turn and who will remain pure?  Someone always turns, in the games I've played.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Does your game have a premise and pregenerated characters like Lady Blackbird?  Or is it a more general type of roleplaying game, where every group will have different kinds of adventures?<br/><br/>One more thing: I think that good Keys and Secrets should suggest combos -- for instance, in Jedi Blackbird, the padawan character has the Secret of the Vanishing Act, which allows him to slip out of any scene undetectably, and the Key of Ambition, which is hit when he acts independently to resolve an issue.   The Jedi Guardian character has the Key of Dark Side Seduction and the Key of the Mission -- whenever he acts aggressively in the service of his mission, he hits two Keys at once!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/composertp" title="composertp"><img alt="composertp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tINibczPBx0/ToT_TX0gjLI/AAAAAAAAB_8/LRyRi1plPkw/s800/docsavage%252520avatar%252520white%25252032x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/composertp">composertp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345150/#Comment_345150" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T05:50:25+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  5:50AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>johnzo</b>: Yes, I have a premise and pregen characters, in the LB tradition.<br/><br/>Thanks for your own take on Keys.
