I'm at the point where I like some of the concepts of Fate, but the execution leaves me high and dry. The four actions really rub me the wrong way. They're an immersion-shattering experience that routinely ends up with conversations like:<br/><br/>Player: "I'm going to embarrass the Countess by sneering at her attire."<br/><br/>GM: "Are you trying to Create An Advantage to put an Aspect like <b>Embarrassed</b> on her, or are you Attacking her to take her out?"<br/><br/>Player: "Uhhh..."<br/><br/>Maybe it's from playing with people who don't "grok" Fate. Maybe <i>I</i> don't "grok" Fate. That's why I'm wondering how possible it would be to play with only Overcome actions, as with Burning Wheel's first 74 pages.<br/><br/>You'd have to alter the stress and consequences systems for this to work, of course.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463824/#Comment_463824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-11T05:09:22+00:00" title="June 11, 2017  5:09AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have tried it.

If you win you end up with a beaten down opponent.<br/>Throwing a handful of sand in his eyes will not, by itself, achieve your goal. If you win you end up with an opponent still standing and hostile, with sand in his eyes. Which, in and of itself, could be useful if you find a way to leverage it.<br/><br/>This is what I meant. One action OBVIOUSLY has the potential to achieve your goal. The other OBVIOUSLY does not. You, as a player, choose nothing. You are not allowed to. The description is already done, and now you simply assess what is OBVIOUSLY what.<br/><br/>What is OBVIOUS, though, changes depending on your circumstances and your INTENT, your goal for the action.<br/>Which is a different element of this equation.<br/>One example that for me is very important:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>"I\u2019m going to embarrass the Countess by sneering at her attire.\u201d is first describing.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nTo me this is not just describing. And in my very personal game experience this is not what I've seen happen in the vast majority of occasions. Usually the "description" ends up being just this:<br/>"<i>I sneer at the Countess attire</i>"<br/><br/>WHY are you doing that is often not stated openly, and even not clear in the player's head. There is no underlying strategy, no real aim... it's just roleplaying, a reaction to a fictional situation.<br/>Which leads to the following step:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>\u201cAre you trying to Create An Advantage to put an Aspect like Embarrassed on her, or are you Attacking her to take her out?\u201d<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThis, as you also mentioned, leads to the classic "Uhhh..."<br/>Because by presenting the game flow in this fashion, the Fate system offers to the Player a "tactical" choice that might contradict or simply not represent what he had in mind when he made the original description.<br/>Now you have to ponder: why did I made such description? what could I get out of it? what SHOULD I get out of it? can I make the mechanical effect X or Y fit into it?<br/><br/>In the Countess example you question the meaning of the action, and then the meaning of the meaning, and then the meaning of the meaning of the meaning XD<br/>1) Why do you sneer at her dress? --&gt; to embarass her.<br/>2) Why do you embarass her? --&gt; to either A=defeat her or to B=create an advantage<br/>3) What is most convenient/effective/fitting choice between A and B? --&gt; <b>Uhhh...</b><br/><br/>It probably sounds worse than it actually is. Sorry for the dramatic representation. But it does highlight how/why so many players end up in the Uhhh situation.<br/><br/>Now, this might look similar to how FateLess works on the surface. But I guarantee you that the difference is not trivial. FateLess used the same flow as Fate, in its early development stages, and encountered the same problem. But since the mechanic changed the problem almost vanished (tested on new groups that never played FateLess before, not on veterand that have internalized the system workings).<br/><br/>Maybe it is just a difference in how the mechanics <b>present</b> the same concept,  if you choose to look at it that way, but if so it surely is a very small detail with a darn big impact on the gameplay results :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464021/#Comment_464021" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T13:18:10+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  1:18PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The question one asks is: is the described action capable, <b>potentially</b>, to overome the problem?</p></div></blockquote>\nAnd herein lies the issue.

I only have a 1/81 chance (1.23%) of that happening. I pretty much need all ++++.<br/><br/>I need just blanks or better to create an advantage, and then if I go in with all teeth next turn, I only need ++. With two advantages I can defeat her with all blanks. To roll 0 or better three times in a row is 24% (and even easier if I can deal with missing a couple of times). The cost of this is that I open myself up for attacks during the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464032/#Comment_464032" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T18:12:44+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  6:12PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2017 6:13PM by Hasimir.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry Sandra but I'm not following your reasoning.<br/>I fear we are twisting words by basing this current issue on very vague and abstract examples.<br/>Of course anything could be anything depending on intent, circumstances, etc.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is that if you first "<i>clear the air</i>" about the intents and goals of whatever action the PC is currently undertaking, and then look at which mechanic fits ... it all kind of falls into place by itself.<br/><br/>While if you first describe whatever, and then ask the player what mechanical effect she prefers to use that action for ... it is more common to get mentally stuck.<br/><br/>At least that's what I've observed at my tables :P<br/>I don't know, maybe it also (or mainly) merit of some other element in the surrounding system.
