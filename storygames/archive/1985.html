                    Kind of halfway between "Gaming Links" and "GameCraft" and "Little Ideas" topics, so I'll drop it in this topic for now.<br/><br/>I dunno if any of you had, read, or heard of ARIA: Canticle of the Monomyth. It was a remarkable sim-exploration of creating a character framed in its society, and then take it to the macro level with concepts of player-character bloodlines and nations.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was a muddled mess, and the authors never turned up to any event to promote or explain their product or how it worked, so it died a cold, frozen death.<br/><br/>There was a companion book called "ARIA: Worlds", which was 'the reference' for creating a fantasy world. Turned out that all it could really help create was Western-style worlds where a lot of default Western-style things were taken for granted. On top of that, the worksheets in the back (Impressive, mind you) totaled about 25 pages of navel-gazing solo play. I could easily imagine that a crafty GM would spend all this time fiddling with making this new, awesome perfect world, then not want to use it for fear of wrecking it by putting it into play.<br/><br/>In any case, Troy "Power 19" came up with some setting-related questions on his blog recently. At first glance, they look like an excessively long list for creating bottom-up setting. But looking deeper, I can totally see where they run parallel to the efforts behind that Masterpiece/Crap (I firmly believe that it was at the same time "Incredible" and "Useless") ARIA Worlds. But in this case, the setting generation questions are actually useful for producing a gaming-ready setting, without this sort of fanciful "I'm going to create my own little world, and hope that the players 'get it' " wistfulness of ARIA or other ground-up worldbuilding efforts.<br/><br/><a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/12/what-is-setting-part-3.html" rel="nofollow">http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/12/what-is-setting-part-3.html</a><br/><br/>What I'd love to see is a collaborative action by a game group to go through the above questions, to get some total buy in. Or maybe the GM comes up with the above, runs it by the group, revises it, and then goes.<br/><br/>In any case, in my regular Thursday group we've got this upcoming year-long GURPS game (loosely based on Firefly) on the horizon with a semi-collaborative setting, but there's still a lot of open questions out there (is the tech important or not? What is there to do, really, if the players want to be proactive? etc). I'm definitely wanting to run these questions by the group and see what shakes loose.<br/><br/>EDIT: Uh... I want to discuss, but there's really no questions in my above ramble, is there?  I guess if anything else, I'd like to hear people's thoughts, and perhaps a critique of questions or question categories? Or if nothing else, just give the blog post a read. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Like the hero in Apocalytpo I too should be named "Almost."  But thta's not why I am commenting.  ARIA was "almost" my claim-to-fame.  I was slated to write up the Magic book for ARIA.  We had a 40 page outline and it was only just a matter of fill-in-the-blanks (very much the same vein as the other books) but Unicorn moved on to other things (namely DUNE and WotC) and school got complicated (internships and the like).  So it was never to be.  boy would that book have been different if I were to write it today.<br/><br/>I have fond memories of ARIA and your estimation is spot on - Masterpiece/Crap!  I don't believe it was entirly unplayable by traditional standards but probably unplayable "as written."  It was a Sim bonanza and inspires tons of game ideas for me (including a tribal game that has been stewing in me over the last two years).<br/><br/>A collaborative development would be way cool.  My wife was hooked on Burning Empires with one World Burning session.  I can see where such a fantasy world building supplement/game would be awesome.  Didn't someone  mention they were working on such a thing in that thread on "does System Matter?"  I'm unfortunately too lazy to refer back to the 2 pages of posts.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Andy, like the Power 19, this looks like a very particular list to me, leaning towards the creation of a fairly traditional roleplaying setting.

Hmmm, really? I mean, I totally got that riff from the Original ARIA Worlds world-building stuff. But this stuff smells a lot more like, "OK, here's a setting element, HOW DOES IT RELATE TO THE CHARACTERS/PLAYERS/PLAY?" and asks that question over and over again.<br/><br/>Ex:<br/>==============<br/>================<br/><i>Geography<br/>1. What are the significant land features or man-made structures of your Setting?<br/><b>2. How do or how can these features be used by the players during the game to help them play?<br/>3. How do these structures or features affect the Inhabitants and Dynamic Forces of your Setting?</b></i><br/><br/>-Social Situation<br/>...<br/>5. How can players and their characters use and be affected by the Social Situation during play?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>-Enhancements<br/>1. What parts of your Setting might be confusing or too abstract for a reader?<br/>2. What types of graphic organizers (maps, charts, cards, graphs, illustrations, diagrams, etc) can you add to help give the reader/player a better understanding of the Setting you created?<br/>3. Where can the items mentioned above be used to add color, interest, and emphasis in your Setting?<br/>================<br/>==============<br/><br/>Then, from that part, all the Where the PCs Fit In, Dynamic Forces, Mutables, etc seem exactly (to me) what setting building should be about: Building a setting with the Game/Story/Players in mind, not just building a fully-populated working setting for the sake of itself.<br/><br/>What were you thinking might be more up-to-date? That is, what would be a modern sociological/anthropological lens provide that would still provide the tools to:<br/>* Construct a game setting (reasonably quickly and easily) which<br/>* Focuses on the fact that it's meant to be used for play?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy, I was thinking about it, and I think my concerns may be pretty different from yours, since you're reveling in how this is a solution to the problems with Aria Worlds -- which, like you say, was for creating fantasy worlds based on traditional Western medival tropes -- and I'm worried that these questions assume a lot of Western medival fantasy tropes.<br/><br/>Frex, Troy's model assumes that the setting consists of:<br/><br/>- a sizable locale in which there are notable bits of landscape and buildings (you might need maps)<br/>- there's some historical background relevant to current conflicts<br/>- there are authorities that rule the land<br/>- the tech or special powers you have is important<br/>- religion and the supernatural are important<br/>- there are different splats of people, each with special characteristics that define them<br/>- the PCs come from one or more of these splats<br/>- the PCs are somehow exceptional and belong to a class "set apart"<br/>- the PCs actions are opposed by other forces, creating dynamism<br/><br/>And I look at all this and go YAWN, basically.  This sounds like every heartbreaker fantasy setting I've ever encountered, not something new and interesting and different.  Sure, Troy's guidelines make the setting more likely to be relevant to decisions made by the players, but I doubt a setting formulated along these guidelines is going to induce me to really want to play in this world, with some expections.  <br/><br/>Frex, <i>The Matrix</i> could be very easily described using this model.  But the setting of, say, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> would be somewhat harder.  And something like the setting of Shreyas' <a href="http://njyar.thesmerf.com/in-darkness.pdf" rel="nofollow">In Darkness He Is Waiting</a> (which is, suprisingly enough, a fairly traditional fantasy setting) totally breaks it.  History, religion, geography, and splats are just not the important identifying features in some settings.                        </div>

                            Heya,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite><br/>Frex,<i>The Matrix</i>could be very easily described using this model. But the setting of, say,<i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>would be somewhat harder. </blockquote>
Heh, that's kind of funny.  I used Dogs in the Vineyard as the basis for most of the Jumpstart.  It's the game I always go back to in order to test any design tools like this.  For me, it's my baseline.  As for the assumptions in the piece I hope that I made it clear that certain questions and even certain Aspects can and probably will be completely left out for some Settings.  It assumes that these things <b>*might*</b> be useful or important to consider when drafting your Setting.  Not that they necessarily will be.  I hardly feel they dictate that these things must be included.<br/><br/>You mention that this thing assumes a lot of western fantasy tropes.  That may be a fair criticism, but I think we all get into the western fantasy trope mindset any time we talk about Setting- almost by default.  I mean, when someone says "Setting" to me I immediately start thinking Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Middle-earth.  I mean, it's the first thing you picked up when you read the list, wasn't it?  But even as you say, the Matrix could easily be modeled with the Jumpstart and so could a lot of other sci-fi, pulp, and horror Settings.  We have to expand our default mental definitions of things like "authority", "supernatural/divine" or "groups of people".  And really, that's the point of the Jumpstart in the first place.<br/><br/>Keep in mind at the same time that, while my target audience was game designers, I also believe GMs and players can make good use of the Jumpstart.  People who play games that encourage you to create Setting during play could have a copy of the Jumpstart next to them as they play to....well... jumpstart some ideas.  I can see it have the potential to be an imensely useful tool.  I'd at least want to see it in use in such a contect before dismissing it as such.<br/><br/>I'm definately open to criticism concerning the Jumpstart that include useful suggestions, so long as they keep in mind the two things Andy cited as its most useful traits:<br/><br/>* Construct a game setting (reasonably quickly and easily) which<br/>* Focuses on the fact that it's meant to be used for play?<br/><br/>And hey, you know, if it doesn't strike your fancy, I would totally welcome an alternative.  The Jumpstart is just one tool, one path a person can take.  I am all for other people creating design tools like this to help newbie designers get their game design kickstarted.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Could you explain?  You might very well be right, I just don't think I understand your meaning.  When I tested it and then wrote it, I tried to keep it as focussed on the PCs as possible.  Or maybe I mean players.  Hm.  I wanted to communicate the idea that "If it doesn't affect the player-character or isn't a tool for the GM, why put it in there?"  I don't think a Setting needs a lot of fluff that won't come into play.  At least, that's what I tried to communicate with this thing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            I suspect Shreyas is pointing out that, using this model, you seem to create the setting first and then find protagonists among the setting's factions.  Instead of starting with the characters and building a world around them or, as Shreyas tends to do, chose the main "elements"/tropes of the cosmology and derive both characters and setting from them.<br/><br/>Troy, I hope you can view my criticism of the P19 and the Jumpstart as purely constructive, because that's the way it's meant.  I definitely see a lot of value and even more potential in the kinds of checklists you enjoy turning out.  They don't really reflect the way that I tend to approach design, but that's cool.  They're definitely on the aforementioned "stuff that I think is awesome but don't quite get as much as other people" list.  And I really enjoy using them as excuses to talk about different approaches to design.  So yeah.  Full agreement.                        </div>

                            Heya,
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite>I suspect Shreyas is pointing out that, using this model, you seem to create the setting first and then find protagonists among the setting's factions. Instead of starting with the characters and building a world around them or, as Shreyas tends to do, chose the main "elements"/tropes of the cosmology and derive both characters and setting from them.<br/></blockquote>
Ah, if so then that does make sense to me.  I would definately say you'd want to decide what the PCs will be then design the Setting around them.  That may be a flaw in the Jumpstart as it is written.  I really think you should start with what you want the characters to be and what you want them (and the players) to do before you start deciding exactly where you want them to do that.  In truth, I'd have to say that a designer should be able to answer the Big Three before moving on to the Setting Jumpstart.  That's something I should probably mention on my blog.<br/><br/>As for your criticism, Jonathan, I totally welcome that! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I am all for rigorous examination of anything I create.  I am fully prepared to defend my decisions and at the same time open minded enough to realize that I probably didn't get it right on the first try.  So hey, bang away!  I have no ego to bruise.  But I will defend my work until I see that it isn't defensible.  Then I'll change it! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I really appreciate you (and Andy) not being affraid to give me your oppinions on this stuff.  It means a lot to me.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Shreyas: "[setting] becomes problematic and inhibitory to strongly characterised play if it exists prior to character."<br/><br/>Err, really? And I say this as someone with fairly good credentials as an advocate of the argument that "fetishistic setting detail is bad for you" (viz. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=222</a>). I've had cases, both in writing short stories (unpublished and probably unpublishable) and in playing RPGs, of (1) coming up with character concepts and then creating a setting around them, (2) inventing or reading about a setting and coming up with characters inspired by it, (3) coming up with characters pretty much independently of setting, based on broad genre assumptions ("D&amp;D" or "superheroes") and shoehorning the two together (hello, many iterations of D&amp;D!). I've had successess and failures with all three methods --yes, even the last one, which seems destined for crap but actually works surprisingly often.<br/><br/>I think the best practice -- and the actual practice more often than people realize -- is iterative between setting and character: a strong idea about one element logically (or illogically and intuitively) leads to another strong idea about the other element, which in turn has logical (or intuitive) consequences about the first element, and so on back and forth. Only in practice much more chaotic than that, usually. People can spin entire rich settings from the starting point of "Whatever we do, I want my guy to have a mohawk and a laser sword" and can come up with dynamic characters from a seed of "Gee, it says here that the Thing-Smashers of Whateverplace have the Yak-Riding and Obscene Limerick skills at 11, that sounds kind of cool."<br/><br/>Now, big fat sourcebooks (or canonical novels, films, whatever) full of setting detail lovingly laid out with no regard for their potential to generate story later, yes, that's a problem, and a distressingly common one. But surely a properly designed setting is pregnant with potential conflicts and characters, not at odds with them.                        </div>

                            I dunno dude, I think you might be reading too much into it. At least tell us some things that these other non-western settings have that can't be laid out by Troy's model, cause I'm not seeing them.<br/><br/>In fact, when I even looked at the elements that you singled out, I saw everything from Asian cultures (Japan, Tibet, modern or ancient) to Aborigine culture to African culture to Aztec cultures.<br/><br/>ex:<br/><br/><b>- a sizable locale in which there are notable bits of landscape and buildings (you might need maps)</b><br/><br/>I see a jungle, a popular watering hole, two towns (one very small, one medium) and a city with a giant ziggurat.<br/><br/><b>- there's some historical background relevant to current conflicts</b><br/><br/>Recently, the Eagle knights have been showing up the Jaguar knights, and their numbers are dwindling. Meanwhile, some of the far runners that connect the empire aren't reporting back, they simply disappear in the North and East.<br/><br/><b>- there are authorities that rule the land</b><br/><br/>What culture or society doesn't have authorities? Even aborigines have a Wise Man tradition, African tribes have storytellers/griots, etc. In the example above, I'd fill in (in a sentence) the roles of high priest, village elder, village leader, and village hunter/captains.<br/><br/><b>- the tech or special powers you have is important</b><br/><br/>The atl-atl, the obsidian-sharpened wooden club, otherwise no high tech. Powers tend to be medicinal or oracular, and very rare.<br/><br/><b>- religion and the supernatural are important</b><br/><br/>Again, if it's fantasy (or ancient historic) there are few cultures where religion wasn't important or didn't play a part. There are few SF settings that don't take it into account as well. And if it really is not important, you can say "Not important, here's why" and even that would be evocative.<br/><br/><b>- there are different splats of people, each with special characteristics that define them</b><br/><br/>This is handy for getting an idea of the kinds of people that there were. In the above examples; leaders, gatherers, priests, hunters, knights, craftsman/weavers. That's just a fwe, but I tend to like to fill in my settings in play, so I'd leave it there.<br/><br/><b>- the PCs come from one or more of these splats</b><br/><br/>Sure, again in most world cultures that's the way it works: Hidemitsu is a Samurai, the son of a Reed Bender/Sandalmaker, and travels in the company of Merchants. Likewise, Petzacatl is a Jaguar Knight who is the son of a Priest, and lives in a hut protecting a town of simple Gatherers.<br/><br/><b>- the PCs are somehow exceptional and belong to a class "set apart"</b><br/><br/>Well, there you're right; but this tends to be more of a "roleplaying game" thing than a "setting" thing - In most settings the PCs are set apart, even in the innocuous ones like Over the Edge (everyone is "special" somehow), Heaven and Earth (the PCs are major players in a pawns game between God and the Devil, etc), even in My Life With Master we see everyone as "Servants", set apart from the townsfolk. So while I concede that point, I also make the argument "What RPGs can I buy that do otherwise?"<br/><br/><b>- the PCs actions are opposed by other forces, creating dynamism</b><br/><br/>Again, I think this is more of an RPG thing than a Setting thing. <br/><br/>So even taking the last two aside, I still don't see how this somehow doesn't allow or makes it hard to create non-Western cultures?  In ARIA, it was simply impossible to try to craft Aztecs, ancient Japanese, Aborigines, Zulu warriors, and was kinda iffy on ancient Western cultures like Celts and Babylonians.<br/><br/>It may definitely have issues, but I'm not seeing them yet in your critique. What would you have added or expressed that would have allowed for more non-Western cultures?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Jonathan read my mind earlier, so lemme try his - it's typical of the Euro-Medieval-Fantasy that these things <em>matter enough to appear in play,</em> and this particular constellation of features isn't inextricable from that cultural colour, but it's certainly related to it in a sensible way.</p>

                            Heya,

Shreyas, at this point I'd suggest that you might be stuck looking at things through the Fantasy Setting prism.  Let's take one of the things you talked about for a second, "opposed by external forces."  I don't think I really stated they have to be external- just something contained within the Setting.  For instance, pretend for a moment the Setting for our game is the Human Mind.  It's an insane mind.  Trapped inside the mind is the real person desperately struggling to get out.  Let's do a very quick and dirty Jumpstart on this:<br/><br/>-History<br/>= What's happend to cause this person to go insane?<br/>= What has happened to him in the past that the players could draw upon to create in-game challenges/content?<br/><br/>-Geography<br/>= Where can he go in his own mind?<br/>= How is the physical space in the mind created?<br/><br/>-Authority <br/>= Are there other personalities in the mind?<br/>= Do they oppress the character? His loved ones?<br/>= How can authority figures in the person's past come into play during the game session?<br/><br/>-Social Situation<br/>= What's it like right now for the real person trying to get out?  What's he going through?<br/>= What does he interact with in his own mind and what is their state of affairs?<br/><br/>-Mythology/Religion<br/>= Is the person religious? <br/>= Does his Faith act as an achor to reality for him?  Does it give him hope? <br/><br/>-Enhancements<br/>= Off the top of my head, can't think of any that would be useful.<br/><br/>-Inhabitants<br/>= Who else lives in the person's mind besides the real him?<br/>= How does he view these others?<br/>= How they view/treat him?<br/><br/>-Where the PCs Fit In<br/>= As mentioned above, he is fighting to escape the Setting.  That's not a question, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>-Dynamic Forces<br/>= Drawing from the Inhabitants, Authority, Social Situation, and History, what is making it hard for the character to escape?<br/><br/>-The Mutables<br/>= What can be changed about the Geography, Authroity, Social Situation, Inhabitants, and Dynamic Forces in play? (probably all of it in this case)<br/><br/>Now that's just right off the top of my head with no system of any kind attached.  The opposing forces are internal as far as the Setting is concerned.  It's all in one person's mind.  I'd hardly call that "Western Fantasy."  The questions I posed under each catagory are just rephraisings of the origonals specific to the type of game I'm creating here.  The answers to those questions would help a designer making such a game create the Setting for his game.  <br/><br/>Did my example make sense?  I hope it's not too off the wall to be useful in this discussion.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Andy, here's an example:<br/><br/>Imagine I'm creating a fantasy world inspired by Jane Austen novels, like <i>Pride &amp; Prejudice</i>.<br/><br/>Asking who the Authorities (rich gentry, monarchy, bureaucracy) are or what the people's Creation Myths are (Adam and Eve) or what the Tech Level is just aren't the most important question you could be asking.  Like Shreyas, I feel like, sure, you could force such a setting through the filter of the Jumpstart, but the Jumpstart itself does not inspire you in this direction and doesn't offer much help in such a case.<br/><br/>Frex, you could try to say that Austen's protagonists are "set apart" as stubborn women full of confidence who will not quietly abide by social norms.  And that they hail from the splat "emerging middle class."  And they are geographically situated outside of the major cities but not completely in the middle of nowhere.  And that Dynamic Forces include the continuing effects of the Industrial Revolution.  But that seems like a real stretch (like Troy's "Human Mind") and something that's not likely to emerge as a result of the Jumpstart.  Instead you need to have a firm idea going in and force it past the Jumpstart's filters.                        </div>
