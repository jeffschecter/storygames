We play many indie games to use the engine of the mechanics to author something that affects the other players. But the result is, paradoxically, less affecting. Because for a story to be affecting it must be made from some of the author's bare personality and honest identity. When a player's character is a tool for affecting others, more than a membrane for two-way communication, play is "awesome" but boring. We appreciate the creativity and talents of our fellow players, but have no contact with their identities.</blockquote>\nThen Ralph said this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Alternatively...mechanics focused authoring eclipsing character play is a good thing.<br/><br/>*I* happen to think its a VERY good thing...even to the point of going as far as saying an inherently superior thing.<br/></blockquote>\nBut did not elaborate, which I am hoping he will do.<br/><br/>Paul, follow-up your example of 'Acts of Evil' didn't help me so much, because I don't know anything about that game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229031/#Comment_229031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T14:13:36+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  2:13PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An example from the erlier thread was The Shadow of Yesterday:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hoho</cite>I don't really think it's that fun to look at my sheet and be like "Oh, I have the Key of the Goat-Molester!

Paul and I have talked about this issue a bit over IM so I know what he means... partially because I agree with him.<br/><br/>One possible point of confusion is Big Model Stances.  Paul is most definitely NOT talking about "Author Stance."  Indeed what Paul is calling "character play" Ron would still refer to as "authoring the character."  What Paul is calling "authoring" is stance neutral.  You can do either the "character play" or "authoring for affect" thing Paul is talking about across all three stances.  As such there really isn't any need to discuss them here.<br/><br/>What Paul is talking about is more related to what I and Eero refer to as "Advocacy Play."  That it is your *job* as the player is advocate for the interests of your character.  That is if the GM says, "The bad guys show up to kidnap you."  You're obligated to try and help your character escape even if you, personally, think it would be more "dramatic" to have him be kidnapped.  Note: That is effort agnostic.  It's okay to put in minimal effort.  This only becomes problematic when you go, "Hell yeah!" and spend game resources or whatever on the side of the GM.<br/><br/>Why is this problematic?<br/><br/>Because it promotes emotional distancing on the part of the player.  Basically, the player is trying emotionally impact the others in the group *without themselves having an emotional stake in the fiction*.  That's the paradox.  How can something affect someone else when it clearly isn't affecting you.  If it's more "dramatically" interesting to have your guy kidnapped then I suggest it isn't dramatically interesting to have him get away either.  I suggest the entire scene is dramatically void because there is no legitimate, for real, emotional tension among the real-world players.  This is the entire thesis of of my Play Passionately project (which is sadly on hold for the moment).<br/><br/>The next step, of course, is where Paul refers to "connecting with our identities."  The idea here, is that the reason you advocate for your character's interests is because YOU have some personal stake in those interests even if that's a negative stake (i.e. your character believes or does something you personally abhor).  This promotes personal revelation and bonding among your fellow players.  When your character does something revealing, you by consequence, reveal something about yourself.  The character and the fiction by their indirect nature act as a safety zone for this personal exposure.<br/><br/>That's at least what Paul and I have talked about.  Paul can clearify if I've missed something or misrepresented his own position.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229044/#Comment_229044" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:17:19+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 12:48PM by Valamir.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I didn't want to elaborate because it was tangental to that thread.  It's just become so much of the "New Story Game Meme" to criticise author focus mechanistic designed games that I felt the need to announce that not everyone has drunk the cool-aid on that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy distaste for that Meme has several layers, some of which I've discussed at some length on Anyway which is perhaps the epicenter of this current "lead with the fiction" focus.  I'm not sure how effectively I'll be able to summarize my thoughts here, but I'll give a shot at some bullets.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Firstly I think the entire angle (that on Anyway has been called "Lead with the Fiction" and in other places has been called "character focused") is the result of a pretty profound misdiagnosis of observed phenomenon.  The phonomenon being recognized goes something like:  a) there is a highly enjoyable effect in roleplaying where the act of play creates an understandable fiction where events and character action emerge organically from interacting with their environment.  b) There is a certain category of games (i.e. author focused mechanistic designs) which can be played in a way that doesn't engage that enjoyable fiction effect.  c) there are several examples of actual play which fell flat because the fiction was not engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe misdiagnosis IMO comes when the game design is blamed as being the cause of this, rather than putting the blame where it belongs...on the players who didn't engage the fiction.  Just because the game engine will progress through a story arc without *forcing* players to engage the fiction, doesn't mean that that is the proper way for players to use said game engine.  Therefor, to my mind, the proper line of thought is to examine why the players were not engageing on the fictional level and address that, rather than throw out this entire evolutionary (and I would say revolutionary as well) branch of game design in favor of more "character focused" design.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis to me is pretty obvious.  Doing thing A did not produce fun.  I played a game, I did thing A, I didn't have fun.  Therefor the proper solution would seem to be "stop doing thing A".  Instead a rather faulty leap has been made suggesting that these games put a gun to your head and force you to do thing A and therefor its the game's fault.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) On Anyway at least the focus has been on de-commoditizing game mechanics and returning to an older paradigm where the player can only interact with the world through the vehicle of their character.  The idea seems to be that if you strip out all of the other rules that are apparently distracting the player from engaging with the fiction that they'll have nothing left to do BUT engage with the fiction.  This solution boggles me with the extent to which it revisits nostalgia through rose colored glasses.  I think story gamers have become so spoiled by several years of awesome play engendered by awesome games that we've forgotten how horrible many of our earlier game experiences had become as a result of following this paradigm.  There were problems with that paradigm that much of of the author focused mechanistic designs came into being specifically to address.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I'm constantly bemused by the rapidity with which the broader story game community will stampede from one design meme to another.  It is the nature of design communities...and "indie" styled design communities in particular, to pursue novelty by pushing the envelope.  The engineer in me says chasing after the new technology before we've even begun to fully tap and appreciate the possibilities in the old technology is a habit of questionable value.  Oh how quickly "scene framing, conflict resolution, stake setting" and other techniques have fallen out of favor and are now commonly disparaged by the same people who embraced them just a few years ago.  I find that practice rather distasteful and disingenuous.  Pursuing the new hotness is all well and good...I think gaming can sustain and benefit from a wide range of hotnesses...but there's no reason to disparage the old hotness on the way out the door.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The engineer in me has a profound distaste for philosophical theories being used (usually incorrectly) to justify poor or lazy design.  The Fruitful Void (also, perhaps not uncoincidentally being revisted currently) was a big source of this.  Its central insight (that designing too directly what your game is about can actually hinder rather than help) was promptly misused to justify any number of sloppy designs.  Numerous were the occasions over the past few years where broken unfinished work was explained away as "that's the Fruitful Void"...um no...that's just the part of the game you couldn't be bothered to actually write...there's nothing fruitful about that void...its just a void.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe "Lead with the Fiction" paradigm's advice to search for non-commoditized solutions when designing for player behavior has the similar potential to be misapplied as a catch all justification for not bothering to actually design rules that work.  I am anticipating the first thread where a designer comments "I don't need to have rules...I'm leading with the fiction".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229045/#Comment_229045" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:17:28+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So those are reasons why I tend to not automatically think the Character Focused angle is actually a better solution.  Why do I think the Author Focused solutions are at least as good, and quite likely better?<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Largely because Author Focused games are by nature, to borrow an Alton Brown phrase "Multi-taskers" while Character Focused games are by nature "Uni-taskers".  You can, while playing an Author Focused game ALSO completely engage with the fiction, advocate for the character, and fully enjoy all of the things that the phenomenon described in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> indicated was missing in some AP.  You have to try, and the game usually won't force it upon you, but you can, and can very well.  But the converse is typically not the case.  When playing Character Focused types of games where your agency in the game is primarily limited to that of your character you typically lose the ability to reach up to the author level and tug on story strings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, a design that provides both avenues of player agency is inherently superior to one that provides only one.  Sacrificing one altogether simply to make the other easier strikes me as a throwing out the baby with the bathwater solution.  Now I recognize that some game experiences require specifically NOT letting the players tug on the story strings.  And for such experiences a character focused design may well be the right choice to make.  As I said, there's more than enough room in gaming for multiple different types of hotness.  But that's a specific application.  As a general principal more flexibility is usually better than less.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Additionally I believe that a game whose mechanics allow you to engage them completely effectively and completely enjoyably WITHOUT engaging in the fiction at all...is a SUPERIOR design...not, as Vincent suggested in some Anyway threads a while back...an inferior one.  The fiction is something you layer on top of the mechanics AFTER you have mechanics that actually function.  Mechanics that won't function without fictional input are not effectively designed mechanics at all.  At best they are illusions disguising GM fiat (or potentially other player fiat depending on who the ultimate fictional judge is).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite example of a superior mechanic design in this sense is Polaris.  It would be hard to imagine (and I've never experienced) actual play of Polaris that didn't engage full force with the fiction that didn't produce memorable characters doing memorable things in memorable ways...ways that are both meaningful and impactful to the players.  And yet, the mechanics stand alone by themselves quite well.  By simply substituting "Good things happen to my guy" and "Bad things happen to your guy" for real fictional events and characters you can use the Polaris mechanics completely effectively.  You can play out an entire conflict fully utilizing all of the game rules...without ever creating or requiring a scrap of fiction.  Because the rules work.  The rules work on their own, with no fiction required to make them function.  This is a GOOD THING.  And it in no way detracts from the ability to then use those rules to engage the fiction<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to summarize, I think the entire "character focus" meme originated from some misdiagnosis of actual play problems.  I think it has some inherent short comings and pitfalls that are inadequately addressed in some of the current designs purporting to use this paradigm (Apocalypse World being the easiest example).  And I think it entirely misrepresents how effective more author focused and commoditized play can be at addressing the very issues that they are claimed to not be able to address well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229051/#Comment_229051" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:35:31+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 3:37PM by Jesse.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br>My favorite example of a superior mechanic design in this sense is Polaris.

No you CAN NOT use Polaris's mechanics effectively without the fiction.  When you make a declaration in Polaris without its emotional content within the context of the fiction I have NO IDEA, NONE, ZERO whether I want to go with "But only if..." or "You ask too much..."  I simply can not respond in a meaningful manner without that detailing.  Vincent made this EXACT point with the Raises and Sees in Dogs in the Vineyard.

Not the best example, as it turns out.<br><br>Here's another example ... In A Wicked Age is one of my all-time favorite games. In IAWA games, I've seen players get behind their characters and work for them to overcome the odds and kick ass, old-school D&amp;D style, and I've also seen players (in the very same games), play villains or comic relief characters with little concern for the fates or success of those characters.<br><br>But I love that game, and, like The Roach, I think it reliably creates good fiction and good role-playing. Would you consider this example of authoring mechanics?<br><br>I *think* this is what Ralph is saying ... you can advocate for your character in a game with author-focused mechanics, so that *kind* of play works, but you can also work against him/her. And in a game without author-focused mechanics, you can *only* advocate for your character, if you want to make the engines go.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229064/#Comment_229064" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:57:12+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:57PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Sage.<br>\n<br/>\nI think, emotively &amp; narratively, there's a difference between guiding your Cthulhu investigator into ruin - you know there will be ruin as a consequence of your actions - and guiding a character in a narrative game framework into self-introduced ruin.  That's a wordy way of saying that I, as another player, don't care about your self-introduced drama.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, for some reason, if you start off with "I don't get along with my dad" on your character sheet and the GM is responsible for introducing the challenges this bit of drama results in, the scenes are cooler and I care about them more.  I may even have an opportunity to involve myself, which makes me care about them even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative is a bit like. . . well, let's say it's your turn to play and you're like, "I'm gonna go visit my dad, who I don't get along with" - my response will initially be, "Your character has a dad?  When did that happen?  When did you stop getting along with him?" and then everything you subsequently say will seem like you're just making stuff up.  If the drama really has no impact on the game, I'll also wonder why I care.  Heck, I'll wonder why you care too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why drama that emerges via tense moments in the game, often created via the mechanics, via random chance, via an immersive setting where we're all "getting it", seems more interesting to me than drama made up by a player.  If you actually have to ride off into the sunset because the game just works out that way, we're all gonna go, "Remember that time Sage had to ride off into the sunset?  God damn!"  But if you just make that up at the end because you think it's cool even though it has nothing to do with the game, you're gonna sound like a bit of a tool when you recount the story of that one time you narrated about your character riding off into the sunset.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229068/#Comment_229068" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T16:01:26+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  4:01PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I posted before I saw those last few comments.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>I think the divide between authoring the character and playing the character comes to some degree from the motivation: are you playing your character as they pursue a goal (even if that goal is tragically flawed and you know it) or are you playing your character to present a great story?<br/></blockquote>\nI guess I'd have to say both, depending on the game and the character.

Let's say we're a few sessions into an ongoing Cthluhu game, and so far we've been dealing with cultists ripping a hole in eternity from their caves in the remote jungles of Borneo.<br/><br/>If, in that session, the GM says "and then the Soviet assassins that have been following you since you first met attack!" things are likely to kind of fall apart. Unless the GM has given some hints that the Soviets are after the players, or at least hinted at something sinister lurking in the bushes, the threat seems meaningless and just a way to create trouble. I think, as players, we're more conditioned to accept this, since 'the GM's word is law,' but that doesn't make it less lame: someone just added a challenge to the fiction that doesn't seem to have anything to do with anything.<br/><br/>Now, if in that session a player says "I go to see my dad, who I don't get along with," it's really kind of the same thing: it's not that there's a problem with setting your character up to fail by advocating their goals (NOT their best interests, since Dad is actually a cultist, of course), it's that you've introduced a new element to the fiction kind of abruptly. It's just made worse by the opportunity for a Czege Principle issue when you start advocating for your meeting with your dad to go wrong, even though your character wants to make things work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229080/#Comment_229080" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T16:23:11+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  4:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 4:23PM by Jesse.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian,<br/><br/>I can't say with certainty because it is just a hypothetical situation but your Game 1 vs Game 2 example is certainly on the right track.

Fantastic! I guess this is a slight caveat to my stance: you can get away with not advocating for your character in some very specific cases, most notably in deciding when their story ends.<br/><br/>Option 2: You decided your character was the bad guy and would lose to the hero, so you lead him towards that end. If this is the case, where is the conflict in the game coming from? Each time the hero and villain face off, both players are going to be on one side. At most you're disagreeing over the proper time for the end to come. Might as well do away with rules entirely (which isn't a bad thing). There only seems to be one interesting side in the story (the hero's).<br/><br/>This is pretty specific to this example, but hopefully it adds something: if the players are at odds, they're kind of GMing for each other. If one of them doesn't oppose the other consistently and strongly, it's like getting everyone together to play D&amp;D and not putting any monsters in the dungeon.<br/><br/>In a more general sense, if you're advocating for the coolest story for your character, why are you playing a game?

Or I prompt the GM with something I want the character to pursue, and expect the GM to either allow it or to challenge me along the way.<br/><br/>* When I respond to the GM's situation with my character, my depiction of him is as consistent with his various traits as I can be. I play this way despite whatever game-level consequences may be looming as a result.<br/><br/>* The creativity I enjoy bringing to the table is in the portrayal of those flaws and quirks, and then watching the GM and other players take the resulting complications into account -- without judgment and entirely accepting that I'm playing my character in a principled way.<br/><br/>* I like it best when the inevitable out-of-character moments are clearly flagged for me so, either as player or GM, I know what voice to hear things in.<br/><br/>What I don't like to play, and really hate to GM:<br/><br/>* Players who play their characters in an unprincipled, expedient way. That is, I feel like we've all come to an agreement about how someone is going to portray their character, only to watch that agreement broken because the player wants to "win" a situation.<br/><br/>* Players who refuse to engage the fiction like they actually care about it. Don't really care what the motivation is for that refusal; I fucking hate it regardless. They can be scared or uncertain or have cripping stage fright -- DO NOT CARE. The result is flowing, growing timidity that is far more contagious and destructive than enthusiastic, damn-the-torpedoes play. MST3K play is the worst. I've cancelled entire game sessions on that note.<br/><br/>* Play that is entirely divorced from either the mechanics or the fiction. Leading with the fiction is nice and all, but sometimes mechanics prompt new fiction and that's good too.<br/><br/>* Total lack of character ownership. That bums me out. I've tried a few designs and doodles that try and break that mold and it just doesn't do it for me. This element for me pushes my "THIS IS NOT AN RPG" button the hardest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229087/#Comment_229087" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T16:37:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  4:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 4:39PM by Jesse.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage,<br/><br/>Your Option 2 is spot on.<br/><br/>Here's my quibble with Option 1.  I've pretty much learned that when you let a priori assumptions about the nature of the conflict that's about to happen interfere with your decision making you tend to miss out on some pretty amazing story opportunities.  If you let your Hollywood blockbuster informed aesthetic go, "Ah this is the showdown!" before it's actually happened then you miss out on the opportunity that this is NOT the showdown but instead simply a major turning point in an otherwise surprisingly, hither to unforeseen wider narrative.<br/><br/>(Or even simply, "Man that was the showdown and it turned out to be a tragedy!

The battle ended with the PC and the NPC dropping dead in the same round.<br/><br/>The player then had the option to burn a Fate Point (forget the exact name, this was Warhammer) to cheat death. The player decided not to, leaving the character dead and giving the story a fitting conclusion. It was great.<br/><br/>I think the key element is that the player didn't decide it was the end until the battle was done. I stand by that choice, since it wasn't deciding ahead of time that a given even was the end, it was taking a clear ending and not taking the option to escape it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229092/#Comment_229092" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T17:05:26+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  5:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 5:05PM by Jesse.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage,<br/><br/>YES!

It would be hard to imagine (and I've never experienced) actual play of Polaris that didn't engage full force with the fiction that didn't produce memorable characters doing memorable things in memorable ways...ways that are both meaningful and impactful to the players. And yet, the mechanics stand alone by themselves quite well. By simply substituting "Good things happen to my guy" and "Bad things happen to your guy" for real fictional events and characters you can use the Polaris mechanics completely effectively.</blockquote>\nRalph, this, to me, is proof that you don't fully understand Vincent (or Paul or mine's position). No you CAN NOT use Polaris's mechanics effectively without the fiction. When you make a declaration in Polaris without its emotional content within the context of the fiction I have NO IDEA, NONE, ZERO whether I want to go with "But only if..." or "You ask too much..." I simply can not respond in a meaningful manner without that detailing. Vincent made this EXACT point with the Raises and Sees in Dogs in the Vineyard. Without the fictional content of your Raise I have ZERO idea of whether (emotionally) I want to take Take The Blow or not.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>I fully understand it Jesse...and I fully reject it.  Not that the fiction isn't helpful.  Not that it isn't useful.  Not that it doesn't do certain things that are desireable, not that it isn't necessary for play to be fun...but necessary to the MECHANICS?  No.<br/><br/>When there is fictional stuff in Polaris you can evaluate it...How much do you want thing X to happen...how much do you not want thing Y.  You evaluate it, and you decide how much it means to you and you make your decision.<br/><br/>But MECHANICALLY...all you need is the relative value not the fiction that got you there.<br/><br/>Observe:<br/><br/>Heart:  "I want this level 5 Good Thing to happen to my Guy"<br/>Mistaken:  "But only if this level 8 Bad Thing happens to your Guy"<br/><br/>I don't need to know what the good thing or bad thing is to know how to respond.  If I accept I'm suffering more than I'm gaining.  In actual play I'd be evaluating my relative gain vs. relative suffering based on the fiction...but its not necessary for the rules to function.<br/><br/>Heart:  "Ok, but only if this other level 3 Good Thing happens to my Guy"<br/><br/>See...mechanically I know that Good Thing 5 + Good Thing 3 = Bad Thing 8.  In the fiction I'd have to come up with that based on how much things matter to me in the story...but for purposes of engaging the mechanics...its just math.<br/><br/>Mistaken:  "Ok, but only if Level 10 Bad Thing happens to some other character you love".<br/>Heart:  "You ask far too much".<br/><br/>I don't need to know what he asked to know that throwing another 10 units of Bad on top of the equation is asking too much.<br/><br/><br/>Is this interesting?  No,<br/>Would it produce good actual play?  No<br/><br/>But does it demonstrate that the principals on which the mechanics are grounded are fully balanced and functional even outside of the fiction?  Yes.<br/><br/>THAT'S what makes the Polaris mechanics so profoundly good.  You know they work regardless.  NOW when you play and you add fiction to the mix you know you're layering fiction on top of mechanics that are fully functional.  No matter what the fiction is, no matter where it goes, the rules can handle it.  Because the rules are stable and functional even with no fiction at all.  What every player is effectively doing in Polaris is evaluating the fiction and deciding case by case on the fly whether that thing that was said is 3 units of Bad or 5 units of Bad and reacting to that perceived balance relative to the perceived value of the good they're after.  Its more complicated and more nuanced and is often a moving target as players turn formerly good things into bad and you find ways to make formerly bad things not so bad.  But essentially...it still boils down to the math.<br/><br/>Dog's is somewhat weak in this regard because while the core of the mechanics function wonderfully, the sloppy balance between the PC's relative effectiveness and NPC's + Demonic Influence relative effectiveness has caused numerous threads worth of questions and problems.  If those mechanics had been balanced against each other such that they worked perfectly well in the absence of fiction, that wouldn't have made the fiction any LESS impactful when it was added.  It would have made the fiction MORE impactful because you'd avoid the times when that balance issue causes problems that disrupt the fiction.<br/><br/>As for the Raises and Sees aspect requring the fiction...that makes for a nice story for Vincent to talk about on his blog but its bupkiss.  One can create perfectly effective play using those mechanics without ever engaging the fiction in the exact same abstract sense I did above for Polaris.  Once you know the mechanics actually work...THEN when you layer the fiction on it, you really have something...and you do...because the raises / sees / and fallout rules are all perfectly functional as raw mechanics without any fiction whatsoever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229099/#Comment_229099" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T17:45:52+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  5:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 5:49PM by Jesse.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I see where you're coming from.  All I can say is that to make your example work, you've layered in a systemic component that doesn't exist in the game.  You point out that evaluating the fiction is *required* and then show that assuming we slap a number on that evaluation the mechanics work.... but uh, you DON'T slap a number on your statements in Polaris.  In other words, you taken the mechanic that IS there (personal judgment of the fiction) and added a mechanic that isn't there (some other way of evaluating the weight of the statements).<br/><br/>If I say, "X happens" (literally that phrase).  How do you know what the number is?  You don't.  You *need* the fiction to make that call.  And more importantly it's YOU whose making that call, not the person speaking.  Your whole argument denies the critical mechanical function of that fictional evaluation by filling it with another mechanic that doesn't exist in the game.  Of course, if the game HAD the mechanic you describe it would work without the fiction.  But the game doesn't have that mechanic.  Observe:<br/><br/>Imagine there IS a number.  If I say, "X happens and it's worth 5 Doom" or whatever.  It doesn't matter what you personally think of X because no matter what, it's worth 5 doom.  And then you get to say, "But only if I get 3 points of Salvation."  Then yes, you're absolutely right.  But then the game has the very problem Vincent and I am criticizing.<br/><br/>Those two things are VERY different games, systemically.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229100/#Comment_229100" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T17:59:42+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  5:59PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree.

How much do I care about my niece.  How bad a fate do I think becoming a demon in this instance of Polaris play actually is...etc...etc.  Ultimately, however, I assign a value to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might even be a numerical value like in my abstraction.  Frex:  "holy cow...on a scale from 1-10 that's like 8 units of Bad"<br/>\n<br/>\nMore often its a relative value on a word scale like "holy cow...that's a whole lot of nasty"<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless...it has a value and that value can be compared to the value I assign the other stuff that I want to happen and from that comparison I can decide whether I'm getting a "good deal" or a "crappy deal" out of the bargain my Mistaken is making me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not a VERY different game...that IS the game.  Always.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've added nothing except to shine a spot light on what is really happening at the table.  All's my abstraction has done is strip away the fiction to get to the core of the system...which is a comparison of relative value between and among multiple events. And again...its not to say that the game should be PLAYED at this level.

You can just chose which forms to roll for a conflict (say, Directly and With Love) without actually narrating anything that ties them into the scene. But the scene will be much better if you *do* narrate fiction that ties them in. The last time I played IAWA, there was a player who didn't spend much effort doing that, and it made for less interesting conflicts. You know? He'd just kind of grab the dice, and roll whatever.<br/><br/>So when we're talking about advocating for a character, as opposed to authoring a character, we're talking about mechanics, correct? <br/><br/>Jesse and/or Ralph, would you say that IAWA's mechanics promote authoring characters, as opposed to merely advocating for them, and this is makes them superior mechanics, to your way of thinking? <br/><br/>Or am I totally off the reservation now?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229128/#Comment_229128" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T22:50:57+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 10:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I think these two are unrelated (more or less) things.

They're in the same arena (making people engage with the fiction on an emotional level), but they're two different phenomenons. you can be authoring but be forced by the mechanics to detail the fiction and you can be role-playing but fail to detail the fiction because the mechanics don't force you to.<br/><br/>Trad games are all doing both the "no authoring" and the "force detailing" things.

In AW that player literally could NOT do that.  If he wasn't putting forth effort to describe his characters actions*...and if the GM isn't putting forth effort to describe the environment and the actions of the NPCs embedded in that environment than no one will ever get to roll dice and the game will just...stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that exceptionaly intrigueing from an experimental design let's-poke-at-this-and-see-where-it-goes perspective although I don't find it all that compelling as a solution to the problem of lack luster fictional engagement.  (as noted above I think this solution brings with it more problems than it solves and I think there are other ways to solve the problem with out introducing more).  But, as a fun thing to try, its a pretty cool thing in its own right.<br/>\n<br/>\n* a key piece to this particular issue can be found in your phrase "narrate fiction".  The catch phrase "Lead with the Fiction" is a bit misleading in this regard because most folks would understand "The Fiction" as being synonomous with "The Story" which is more of an author focus concern.  What the catch phrase really means is "lead with the concrete details of the here and now."  For the GM...what does the character see, hear and smell.  For the player...what does the character think, feel, and do.  Then the "story" such as it is develops organically from the intersection of those two things and will automatically have substance and gravity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone at this point who is scratching their head and thinking "wait...doesn't that sound like the whole 'Impossible Thing Before Breakfast' that we worked so hard for years to purposefully avoid" is seeing one my (several) issues with this approach as a "solution" to the identified problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat IaWA allows is for players to narrate fiction (i.e. high level story stuff) rather than simply narrate / advocate for their character.  This IMO is a good thing...it is, after all, what we spent 5+ years at the Forge struggling to learn how to do effectively  But it does allow players to fall into the bad habit of ONLY narrating high level story stuff and forget to actually advocate for their character.  For some this makes the experience feel less like a Role Playing Game and more like a "story boarding workshop".<br/>\n<br/>\nI think story boarding workshops can also be hella fun, but its also nice to have a much tighter connection to the characters as people rather than the characters as pawns in the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are those who view the pendulum as having swung too far towards "story boarding workshop" and the New Meme I was criticising is a wellspring of backlash against that.  A wellspring that, IMO, pushes the pendulum too far back in the other direction, which is why I felt the need to highlight my problems with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229167/#Comment_229167" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T07:20:03+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  7:20AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>What IaWA allows is for players to narrate fiction (i.e. high level story stuff) rather than simply narrate / advocate for their character.

If we expect our games to do everything for us as players, then we will inevitably look for mechanics to force us to roleplay well.  I say that's a bunch of BS.  "The game" has always, and should always, be a tool that we as players use to roleplay skillfully.  But we all have to bring that skill to the table.  We can't just wind up a toy and expect it to do the work for us.  If we are forgetting to set concrete scenes, and merely story-boarding, then that may be our own fault.<br><br>A separate issue is a game that specifically tells us to merely story-board instead of roleplaying.  I think that's bad design because it saps the power of roleplaying.  If you want to sit around and story-board, I suppose that's your prerogative.

How do the mechanics of that game solve the problem? I'm hoping the answer is more elegant than "The rules explicitly tell you to narrate something".</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nCaveat:  Understand that my own bias is: there is no real problem needing to be solved, and if there was I'm not sure AW mechanics actually do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that, I'll try to demonstrate how the AW mechanics work.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst and foremost is the central AW mechanics tenet which, rather cleverly, goes like this:<br/>\n"If you do it, do it...and to do it, do it"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this means is that 1) if you describe your character doing something that the GM feels falls into one of the Dice Roll Categories you must roll, period...the "if you do it, do it".  and 2) if you want to roll you must describe your character doing something that the GM feels falls into one of the Dice Roll Categories, period...the "to do it, do it" part.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dice Roll Categories are where this becomes something more than just "narrate cool stuff before you roll".<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't roll for skill checks or attribute tests or anything like that.  You roll when you coerce someone into doing what you want them to do, or to resist same (only players roll in AW).  If you want to simply persuade someone...there's no roll for that...you actually have to persuade them player to player by playing it out.  So no "I persuade you to help me..." &lt;roll some dice&gt; "you do".<br/>\n<br/>\nYou only roll for coercion.  If you Bully and Intimidate them you roll for "Going Aggro".  If you just smack the crap out of them you roll for "Sieze by Force".  You can also roll to Manipulate or Seduce (i.e. in AW seduce = manipulate with sex).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo combine this with the above and basically the player just talks...saying what their character does...until they say something that falls into one of the categories and the GM calls for a roll.  Similarly, the GM just talks and says what his characters do...which (more or less) automatically always succeeds unless the player says what their character does to stop it...which typically falls into one of the above categories and results in a roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order for this back and forth to work, however, the world needs to be rich and full of detail.  If the GM says a couple of thugs burst into my work shop and try to flank me I can't say "I dart behind the farm machinery and grab a steam hose" unless we've already populated the world with details like the farm machinery and steam hose.  So it becomes increasingly difficult for me as a player to say what my guy does in a way that falls into one of the categories without that world detail being present.  Similarly it becomes increasingly difficult for the GM to make a "hard move" against me (AW-speak for bringing the hurt) without those layers of details having been built up.  The game eventually either grinds to a halt or becomes completely floaty.  For the game to function at all you really have to be committed to playing "down in the mud".*<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also rolls for sizing up an opponent or a situation which is a way for the player to demand the GM add specific details like "what's my best escape route" to the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far its pretty fun to play...but I don't think it really solves the "problem" above because its just as challenging to play "down in the mud" in Apocalypse World as it is in In a Wicked Age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that in In a Wicked Age if you don't play down in the mud...you still can have a kick ass game session when everyone is floating above their characters in author mode...while a few people will find that disatisfying the game will still function and produce an interesting story.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn AW, however, if you don't play down in the mud...the game simply fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't particularly see "enforced failure" as an effective solution as I can't see how no-play-at-all is a better result than solid-if-somewhat-unsatisfying-on-some-levels play.  I think the goal is that the impending failure of the game to work will serve as a reminder to everyone to come back down to earth and keep yourself grounded in your character...whereas the smooth functioning of IaWA does nothing to remind you to come back down and quite happily purrs along long after you've entered into full blown God of the Story mode.  But that doesn't strike me as a particularly effective technique.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*I'll note here that the game does do some pretty exciting things on the GM advice side of the equation in terms of preparing adversity (codified as "fronts" in the rules), and coordinating the timing of that adversity with clock wheels and regular vs. hard moves.  A regular move being things NPCs are doing in pursuit of their objectives (as outlined for the Front they're a part of) which sets up a Hard Move...which is the pain that comes when the players fail to out maneuver the NPC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as an answer to the declared problem of insufficient "leading with the fiction" I'm pretty underwhelmed with AW's solution.  But as a pretty damn effective way to help GMs codify and track prep, and as a killer means of delivering setting specific color melded (almost) seemlessly with game mechanics to the players via their character "books" I'm extra special impressed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229232/#Comment_229232" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T10:28:23+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:28AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 10:29AM by Valamir.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's kind of an interesting side phenomenon going on here, perhaps the ultimate result of the focus on "system matters" in the early days of the Forge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt goes something like this:  We've spent years drilling into people's head that the *procedural* aspects of game rules are important.  As a crude example:  its not just HOW to make a skill check but also, when, why, who, in what order, and who decides those things that matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result of this effort we now have a number of games that do a pretty good job of outlining clearly and concisely the procedures of play...this IMO is a good thing and I'll Knife Fight the hell out of anyone who says otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's where it get's interesting.  Back in the day when procedures were sloppy or even non existant, players were smart enough to "figure it out".  They'd work their way through the murk and come up with a procedural solution that allowed them to play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now...when they don't have to do all that extra work...when the work is done for them in the design...all of the sudden there's this tendency to (forgive my bluntness) forget to think.  Since the procedures don't specifically say "now is the time to roleplay" they just...don't.  They get so caught up in blindly following the outlined procedures of play that they neglect to do what they sat down at the table to do.  The old games never made special arrangements for roleplaying...it just happened organically because that's what players wanted to do.  But now...you still have players wanting to do it...but instead of making it happen organically they blink and stare and scratch their heads and say "the game doesn't let me roleplay".<br/>\n<br/>\nI liken this to a guy who'd driven a beat up old stick-shift his entire life and who goes and buys a new car with Automatic Transmission and Cruise Control.  All of the sudden he's driving like he's never driven a car before.  Now that he doesn't have to worry about the clutch or holding down the accelerator on long trips its like he expects the car to be full on auto-pilot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote to players in Author Focused Games:  You still have to drive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229233/#Comment_229233" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T10:30:22+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:30AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 10:30AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>This.  I don't get this.  What, exactly, is<em>wrong</em>with an effective story-boarding game?  I understand that it isn't your bag \u2014 and, frankly, it isn't mine, either \u2014 but why does everybody keep saying it's "bad design" or "incomplete" or "lacking" when what they mean is<em>does not do what I like?</em></blockquote>\nThat's a fair question I suppose (and no worries about me taking this personally by the way).  There is obviously a difference between a game that is badly designed and a game that I simply don't like as a matter of preference.  Really, it's a fine line, but one that I'm going to try to define (yikes!).<br><br>I think a game that mandates story-boarding goes beyond my own taste because it fails to generate at least two things: (1) movement and (2) engagement.  Let me take those one at a time.<br><br>First, when I say movement, I mean story -- plain and simple.  Things have to happen in a story.  The characters have to advance, and the plot has to continue.  When you're story-boarding, the opposite seems to take place.  You're not creating a story, you're creating a collection of stagnate "scenes".  If it was a movie, you'd have to actually make the movie in order for the story-boarded scenes to do anything.  As is, they're just sort of sitting there, divorced from the context of an actual story.  They are in need of movement, a common link to tie them all together.  That link is roleplaying.<br><br>The other problem here is that story-boarding encourages strings of revision and discussion.  Instead of stating an action and creating a shared imagined space, the players are constantly moving backwards, stuck in what can become an endless loop.  That's not story.  That's planning.  No movement.<br><br>Second, we have a lack of engagement, both with the characters and with the story.  This is heavily related to my first point.  But really, how can you engage with a story that isn't really a story in the fist place (except maybe in an abstract sort of way)?  I concede that it's certainly not impossible to engage with story-boarded events, but I think it's so much more difficult that it's more of an ideal than a common product of play.<br><br>That may sound harsh, I know, but I don't say it to be confrontational.  I really think that story-boarding leads to a disconnect in most instances.  And I think it's behind a lot of the difficulties that players are experiencing when they sit down to play.  They always seem to wonder why the game doesn't quite seem to work.  Most of the time I want to shout, "What are you preparing?! You're always preparing! Just go!"<br><br>So to bring this back to your question, Josh, what in your mind would be an "effective" story-boarding game?  And I admit that if what you're after is a tool to story-board with, then go for it.  I'm not going to stop anyone.  I'm just saying that I don't think pure story-boarding works as an effective roleplaying game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229236/#Comment_229236" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T10:39:55+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:39AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br><br>Note to players in Author Focused Games:  You still have to drive.</br></br></blockquote>\nI have noticed this at times when I'm playing Burning Wheel or Burning Empire and we are working through mechanics we do not know.

Just games where players forgot to get to the roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSage's experience with Universalis is like that.  The game feels like workshopping the plot for a novel...because its supposed to feel that way.  But that doesn't prohibit roleplaying.  I roleplay the hell out of Universalis.  You have to be quick to pop into and out of character like a GM, but you still should be roleplaying when you play.  Having to periodically drop a Coin in the bank as you roleplay your scene isn't any more difficult than having to periodically roll a die as you roleplay your scene.  When I play Uni and I'm in a scene I'm all about deciding which character I want to control and deciding what that character wants and then spending my Coins to fight for that character to get that thing.  I could play (and from time to time I do) such that in a particular scene I'm all about what *I* as audience to a story want and then spend my Coins to fight for that to happen...but that only works (i.e. is interesting) after having spent the first 80% of the game fighting for the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game works, i.e. produces a narrative, if you don't fight for the characters...but it works alot better when you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo knowing that...my question will always be...why didn't you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229239/#Comment_229239" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T10:49:27+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I suggested that the play was lame because they had talked their way right past 2 or more seasons of play in creating the series history, rather than coming up with a cool premise, getting characters down and playing.</blockquote>\nYes.  Exactly.  PTA is a prime example of a game that, while solidly designed, suffers from a common misconception that it's all about the planning and not about the playing.  Which is of course exactly backwards.  When you turn a game into a story-board event rather than a series of solid scenes grounded in story, the truth is that nothing much is really happening.<br><br>And I'm guilty of this myself at times.  It's easy to get lost in high-level talk.  But I have to remind myself, "just play a scene stupid."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229244/#Comment_229244" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T10:59:14+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:59AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 11:00AM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang, heavily snipped</cite>Things have to happen in a story.  The characters have to advance, and the plot has to continue.  When you're story-boarding, the opposite seems to take place.  You're not creating a story, you're creating a collection of stagnate "scenes"...  As is, they're just sort of sitting there, divorced from the context of an actual story.<br><br>The other problem here is that story-boarding encourages strings of revision and discussion.  Instead of stating an action and creating a shared imagined space, the players are constantly moving backwards, stuck in what can become an endless loop.  That's not story.  That's planning.  No movement.<br><br>Second, we have a lack of engagement, both with the characters and with the story.  This is heavily related to my first point.  But really, how can you engage with a story that isn't really a story in the fist place (except maybe in an abstract sort of way)?  I concede that it's certainly not impossible to engage with story-boarded events, but I think it's so much more difficult that it's more of an ideal than a common product of play.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>See, this is kind of weird, because I really have no idea what you're talking about \u2014 which is to say, while I'm sure this does and has happened to you, I haven't ever experienced this myself.<br><br>Which, I realize all the sudden, isn't quite true, because when we played <em>Polaris</em>, we walked away saying that it created a great outline for a story, but it didn't actually deliver the story.  Which is somewhat ironic, in that folks have been arguing that <em>Polaris</em> does the lead-with-the-fiction thing that makes it immune to storyboardingitis.<br><br>But seriously \u2014 outside of that one game, I've never had trouble connecting scenes together into a story structure, I don't feel mired down in revisions, and I engage with the story being told even if I don't engage individually and personally with my character.  In fact, I actually <em>prefer</em> games with a strong scene structure or economy, because it gives me tools and procedures for pacing and development.  It may be, as I've said in one of the parallel threads (seriously, this discussion is spread out over like four different threads) that I simply 'plug in' with story structure instead of character.  Thus, a game that puts story structure front and center doesn't phase me (and contrariwise, reading <em>Apocalypse World</em> makes my skin kind of crawl thinking about being so profoundly trapped in my character).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Role-playing Characters vs. Authoring Characters - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10303/role-playing-characters-vs-authoring-characters/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Role-playing Characters vs. Authoring Characters - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10303/role-playing-characters-vs-authoring-characters/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I'm sort of with Ralph on this one.

Sort of.<br/><br/>I agree that it's not a "problem" we need to "fix". However, encouraging "down in the mud" playing is certainly a nice feature to have in a game. A game that doesn't do it isn't broken, and it's not bad design, anymore than it's bad design not to have advancement or pacing mechanics. Have it if you think the game is better for it. Don't if you don't.<br/><br/>Also, I agree that AW's mechanics, as described by Ralph (I have neither read nor played it) don't really seem that effective at it. I'm not sure if the "game breaks down if you're not in the mud" thing is a bad idea. It's hardcore, but not bad. What IS bad, though, is that the game seems to be punishing you after the fact. The game breaks down because you didn't narrate the farm machinery in the beginning of the scene. Now it's too late, you can't dive behind it. You can't fix it now. I'd much rather have a mechanic that can't go forward without you describing the fiction NOW, than a mechanic that can't go forward because you didn't describe the fiction five minutes ago.<br/><br/>Yeah, that's my take on it, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229250/#Comment_229250" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T11:11:13+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 11:11AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Which, I realize all the sudden, isn't quite true, because when we played<em>Polaris</em>, we walked away saying that it created a great outline for a story, but it didn't actually deliver the story.

Things have to happen in a story.  The characters have to advance, and the plot has to continue.  When you're story-boarding, the opposite seems to take place.  You're not creating a story, you're creating a collection of stagnate "scenes".  If it was a movie, you'd have to actually make the movie in order for the story-boarded scenes to do anything.  As is, they're just sort of sitting there, divorced from the context of an actual story.  They are in need of movement, a common link to tie them all together.  That link is roleplaying.<br/><br/>The other problem here is that story-boarding encourages strings of revision and discussion.  Instead of stating an action and creating a shared imagined space, the players are constantly moving backwards, stuck in what can become an endless loop.  That's not story.  That's planning.  No movement. </blockquote>\nThat's really quite the opposite of how I have experienced a game like PtA or Universalis (assuming that both fall into the category of story-boarding - I'm not familiar with this concept in the context or roleplaying games, so maybe there is some hidden meaning I don't get). When I played PtA I really got a story that was awesome - or at least much more awesome than a lot of the stories that develepod during games where we all played just one character and tried to find the adventure. What was so great about it? You could focus on all the important stuff without all the dead ends of playing out your character all the time. And what was even cooler: every time you wanted to jump into the head of a character and engage into some character-play you could just do it. So what you can actually get is the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>Of course you have to stop all the discussion at the meta-level from time to time. But that's pretty obvious I think. And of course it's possible.<br/><br/>One additional point. That the connection between a series of scenes is not shown does not imply that there is a lack of plot or that no story is developing. Good storytelling is also about what has to be filled in by the spectator. You can be mute about important situation - but everybody knows exactly what's going on.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite><br/>Second, we have a lack of engagement, both with the characters and with the story.  This is heavily related to my first point.  But really, how can you engage with a story that isn't really a story in the fist place (except maybe in an abstract sort of way)?  I concede that it's certainly not impossible to engage with story-boarded events, but I think it's so much more difficult that it's more of an ideal than a common product of play.<br/></blockquote>\nSince I disagree with your observation about the lack of movement it is not surprising, that I'm also not buying your second argument. The lack of engagement is no inherent problem of games that put a strong emphasize on meta-discussion about how to built the next scene and develop the story. I repeat what I said in the other thread: a player can be strongly involved on an emotional level while he is creating a story. I am. And watching the other players advancing the story creates a strong attachment between them and me as well as between me and the narrative.<br/><br/>So I don't think, that there is a problem with story-board games regarding the opportunities for creating powerful stories (quite the opposite: they seem to be made for exactly this purpose) or for engaging them on a personal level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229282/#Comment_229282" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:38:35+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 1:21PM by Jesse.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, there is A LOT going on in this thread.<br/><br/>So, I'm just going to clarify my own thinking and see where that gets us.<br/><br/>Thing One: What's being discussed is NOT going back To The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast.  The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast was about the GM controlling *the plot* and the players controlling the decisions of the protagonists.  That's NOT the same as the players act through their characters while the GM controls the environment.  That second way is exactly how Sorcerer works, for example.<br/><br/>Also Advocacy Play and Leading with the Fiction is not the same as Actor Stance.  You can make author level decisions about what your character chooses to do next, why he's choosing to do something, when he reveals something, when he doesn't etc.  I like Seth-Ben Ezra's description of this: You are not "inhabiting" the character but you are riding just slightly above and behind him.<br/><br/>My criticism enters when those author level decisions become transparent to me as an audience member.  When it becomes clear that you're trying to have a very specific and calculated effect on the fiction, rather than a sense of honest emotional expression that's free to impact me however, I choose.  Which leads me to the problem of story-boarding which is the ultimate extension of trying to have a calculated impact on the fiction.  So why is "bad"?  (Deep breath because this is going to be controversial).<br/><br/>I have yet to see a session of "story boarding" style play that did not also devolve into a social power struggle over "the story."<br/><br/>It's happened, every. single. time.  If I as a GM get lax with allowing either Stake setting, Scene Requesting or High Card Narration in PtA to be about anything other than the here-and-now details of the fiction it happens.  It happens with In A Wicked Age... if I don't clamp down on Answers/Challenges and Negotiations to being about anything other than the immediate impact of concrete actions.<br/><br/>The reason these break down into a social power struggle is because of the total lack of editorial authority.  The reason Conflict Resolution (as defined by Ron Edwards and not the watered down "story games" version of it) works is because one player says what concrete thing their fictional units do, and another player says what concrete thing their fictional units do and if those things come into conflict then we roll dice and one set of fictional units gets their way and the other doesn't -- irregardless of what we the players are trying to "make" happen.  There's no social power struggle because you have 100% control over your fictional units, I have 100% control over my fictional units and we cede decisions about conflicts between those units to the system.<br/><br/>As soon as who "speaks" for what fictional units, when becomes blurry you open the door to social power struggles.  You see this in endless neogtiation over Stake setting, especially when you allow for explicit Counter Stake setting.  People start reaching over and trying to play each other's fictional units.  People start trying to manipulate the "plot" directly in order to setup some thing for their fictional unit.  It's a mess.  Really and truly.<br/><br/>Every.  Single.  Time.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229286/#Comment_229286" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:41:05+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:41PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Because it promotes emotional distancing on the part of the player.  Basically, the player is trying emotionally impact the others in the group *without themselves having an emotional stake in the fiction*.  That's the paradox.  How can something affect someone else when it clearly isn't affecting you.  If it's more "dramatically" interesting to have your guy kidnapped then I suggest it isn't dramatically interesting to have him get away either.  I suggest the entire scene is dramatically void because there is no legitimate, for real, emotional tension among the real-world players.  This is the entire thesis of of my Play Passionately project (which is sadly on hold for the moment).</blockquote>\nSadly? Sounds like you need to tear it up and throw it out the window, with great force. You should be <i>relieved</i> it's not out there, if this is what it says.  I think it's the word "Drama" in "Dramatically" that is tripping you up. Replace the word "dramatically" with "comedically" and the reason for putting characters at arms length and watching them go becomes obvious.  It is not funny to fall out a window and hang, terrified, from a clockface. It is not funny at all.  You should avoid falling out a window and hanging from a clockface at all costs, and fight as hard as you can to keep the situation in the fiction from involving falling out a window, if you are a character advocate. Meanwhile, as a non-character advocate, me and my group will be laughing our asses off at the poor bastard that fell out a window, laughing so hard we fall off our chairs.<br/><br/>Plus, this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Which circles back to the idea that one of the primary players in an RPG, the GM, isn't roleplaying, despite playing a role-playing game.<br/><br/>Which I think is a fairly daft concept.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229292/#Comment_229292" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:45:40+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 12:46PM by Jesse.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I think it's the word "Drama" in "Dramatically" that is tripping you up.

It's difficult for me to address everything, but I want to at least try to address some major points in a general way.<br/><br/>First, for those of you saying that your game was a success and that you don't know what I'm talking about because it doesn't happen in your games, fine.  It sounds like you're not story-boarding your way through your play sessions.  It also sounds like you engage directly with the scenes that you are creating.  But I'm not talking about those types of play sessions.  I'm talking about the ones where the players sit around and discuss all their options without actually framing a scene, stating actions that become part of the SIS, and so on.  Getting caught up in a cycle of planning and then eventually, kind of, sort of deciding as a group what should happen in a "scene" is what I'm referring to story-boarding.<br/><br/>What I'm not talking about is author stance vs. actor stance.  Author stance is fine and dandy.  It's one of my favorite play modes.  And it doesn't really have any direct application to what I'm trying to explain now.  Let's not confuse author stance with a lack of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Jan, the "connection between the scenes" that I'm talking about has to do with taking pre-narrated or planned scenes out of the ether and into the game itself.  There has to be a context that is created amongst the players for a scene to matter in a story.  You're referring to something altogether different -- the narrative link between two things in a story.  I'm well aware that not everything has to be spelled out to matter.<br/><br/>Also I do not think that PtA or Universalis are story-boarding games.  I think that people play them that way, but wrongly.  And I think that's what leading to a lot of frustration.  People leave roleplaying behind for story-boarding and wonder where all the emotional punch went.  Sure, it's possible to play in this story-board mode and create something that looks like a really cool story.  But why would you want to?  Honestly.  Why?<br/><br/>One more point for now.

But I especially like your comment about social struggle.  What you're describing is called dysfunctional play.  When someone tries to control every aspect of a game, including the intended emotional response to their ideas, then that player is trying to control the people at the table, not the story.  A struggle over narrative control, in other words, is a bit empty because it does nothing to improve the story.  It is only a meta struggle, where the winner is the only one to contribute to the story.  This stands directly opposite from a collaborative effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229310/#Comment_229310" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:07:04+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 1:08PM by Jesse.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,<br/><br/>You're mistaking my word "advocate" for "maximize effectiveness."  Notice, way back in the original post I said this was effort agnostic.  My point is that your declarations for what the character does is representative for the character's goals and drives.  And whatever mechanical fiddly bits you deploy are representative of his chances that it will actually work out in his favor.  It's perfectly fine if your chances are 2% and you're happy that it's 2% and you you're laughing your ass off that it's only 2%.<br/><br/>But what makes it funny is that your poor sap of a character is actually trying for reasons we can relate to as human beings and we have some tiny hope that he might succeed, even though we know, damn, he very, very likely won't.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229316/#Comment_229316" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:21:52+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:21PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 1:22PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But we don't hope he will succeed.

If no one is trying to make Stan succeed, what collaboration is happening? It's just group embellishment. The humor exists (which everyone can laugh at, even the person advocating for him) because Stan's going to try to succeed, and there's a chance he will. <br/><br/>If Stan always fails, all we're doing at the table is telling stories AT each other, not WITH each other. <br/><br/><br/>"Or is that what you are suggesting - that the player must fail at everything he tries for the entertainment of the rest of the table, and at all costs must not be permitted to join in the laughter at his character's expense? "<br/><br/>This is exactly what I've been calling 'authoring' (not author stance): the player has decided Stan is comedy relief, and so he's just storytelling AT everyone. The only conflict in the story comes when someone wants to make Stan not the character his player thinks he is. <br/><br/>If I say that Stan's story is that he's a failure, I can only see a few things for the rules to do:<br/>1. Add details to his failure<br/>2. Give some way of mediating when someone says he's not a failure<br/>3. Actively contradict me when Stan succeeds on a roll<br/><br/>Now if Ollie's player just made Ollie the kind of character that tends towards the comic, conflict can happen that's entirely in game where both outcomes are entertaining. The rules help shape the story and keep in unexpected, as well as allowing other players some input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229321/#Comment_229321" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:26:56+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage:  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy" rel="nofollow">Ollie &amp; Stan</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Zapp and Kiff are perfectly acceptable proxies...since their routine is (like most of Futurama) a homage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229320/#Comment_229320" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:27:11+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:27PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 1:35PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ollie/Stan = Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel, aka Laurel &amp; Hardy, a film (and theater) comedy team from the early part of the century.<br><br>Stan is a milquetoast, short, thin and perhaps slightly dimwitted (depending on the exact role - sometimes he is merely easily befuddled by everyday absurdities.)  Ollie is a prissy, big, overbearing jerk, but, as I say, just as dimwitted, though unlike Stan, Ollie is never confused, he is just wrong.<br/><br/>Edit: A typical Stan &amp; Ollie scene goes like this (note that I am draining the comedy out as much as possible here, "storyboarding", ha, to show the structure of who is trying to do what):<br/><br/>Ollie decides something needs doing. He directs Stan to do it. <br/>Stan doesn't think it needs to be done, he ineffectually ripostes. Ollie bullies him into agreement.<br/>Stan attempts to do what Ollie told him to do, but he misunderstood, so he fails. Ollie escalates, demanding Stan do precisely what he says.<br/>Stan attempts again, either further misunderstanding or running into the fact that Ollie is wrong about what needs to be done, failing again. <br/>Ollie further escalates. This repeats until Ollie says he'll do it himself. Stan tries to help.

I can do that at arms length, look at the character, think a bit about what they'd do, and announce that.  That's not advocacy to me. When I advocate for someone professionally, I fight as hard as I can to get the outcome I want. I don't just weakly say "heh heh heh, I know I won't get this but I know you want it so okay, here goes, heh heh heh". That is weaksauce, it is nothing, just showing up and taking up space.  To the degree that you are advocating for a character's desires, you MUST be let down if the character fails, exactly to that degree. And that is as frustrating and not-fun for you to the same proportion as you have invested in advocating.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229324/#Comment_229324" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:32:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>But we don't hope he will succeed.

It just means that the character should still be enjoyable if he ends up as a misanthropic hermit that can't forgive himself for his brother's death.<br/><br/>I'll use MLWM as an example, since I love that game: the characters wouldn't be interesting if they didn't overthrow the master, so that's not left to the dice. The characters are still interesting if they come out of the fall as forces of good, normal citizens, tragic heroes, or forces of evil in their own right, so that's all left to the players and the dice. The dramatic tension that I think leads to a really, really good game comes from the tension between your best hopes for your character and your worst fears, just like any good movie.<br/><br/>To throw in a non-game example: the ending of Gran Torino is only interesting because we know there's another way the character could have gone, but for a few small events. <br/><br/>As for humor: that's probably a whole 'nother thread, but a big part of humor is the unexpected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229325/#Comment_229325" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:33:02+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:33PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>(I don't get the Ollie/Stan reference, if there is one, so I'm imagining them as Zap Brannigan and Kiff from Futurama, just FYI)</blockquote>\nYou are so young.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229329/#Comment_229329" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:33:14+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:33PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, Tim \u2014<br/><br/>Can you talk about this style of play that you've identified as something you like <em>without</em> disparaging other styles of play as badwrongfun?

But another component of my Play Passionately project involves not deciding what "kind of" story you're telling advance.  Talking about tone is okay.  But saying specifically, "this is a slapstick where the jerk always gets his comeuppance" is not.  Because there is another kind of comedy where the jerk actually does get what he wants and its funny for different reasons.  We don't know in advance which kind of comedy were playing until we roll the dice and find out.<br/><br/>This is getting away from the point because I don't think this is a universal truth.  I don't think the whole of my Play Passionately project is about ALL of role-playing.   A few pieces are relevant globally like the social power issues I described before.<br/><br/>So yeah, if YOUR group pre-decides what "kind of" story you're playing and then works to make sure that target stays on track... okay fine.  I'm not saying THAT'S wrong, per se.  I do find it boring as all hell and have no desire to play with you, but that's preference.  However, I DO think you need different game design components to make that work properly without introducing the social power grab element I spoke about.<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures, In A Wicked Age, Sorcerer, etc... those are HORRIBLE tools to work with if you're pre-invested in the "kind of" story your telling where "kind of" includes notions about certain guaranteed must happen outcomes.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229331/#Comment_229331" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T13:34:41+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  1:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Ollie/Stan = Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel, aka Laurel &amp; Hardy, a film (and theater) comedy team from the early part of the century.<br/><br/>Stan is a milquetoast, short, thin and perhaps slightly dimwitted (depending on the exact role - sometimes he is merely easily befuddled by everyday absurdities.)

When I advocate for someone professionally, I fight as hard as I can to get the outcome I want.

I was using advocating to mean something along the lines of: "making a character take actions to pursue their goals to the best of their ability."<br><br>This may be just me, but I've had a great time advocating for characters who I know are unlikely to get their goals, and even if they get them are unlikely to keep them for long.

But that just goes back to the days of, "system doesn't matter you just need the right group."  There are two extremes.<br/><br/>On one end you have the social monster.  It doesn't matter WHAT game you're playing, they'll find a way to play their social domination games.  Good rules can't solve bad behavior.<br/><br/>On the other end you have the creatively synergistic group.  The group that is so creatively in tune that they'd produce something awesome with any set of rules at all, maybe even none.  So take PtA, play in a story-boarding manner with these people and everything's golden.<br/><br/>In the middle is where good design and system matters lies.  Good design takes attentive, committed functional players and fosters a creative flow that might not otherwise be there.  Take PtA, play in a story-boarding manner.... and well, things probably don't work out as well.  Refocus them to work within the limits of the game's actual design and everything goes back to being golden.

That's precisely because of this issue.  In Agora it's very clear at each moment who holds the editor stick.  Who gets to define the spoils?  Who makes decisions for what units in play?  Who gets to claim the spoils?  And so on.<br/><br/>Now I think Agora *is* a game about power struggle among the players but in a functional game manner (like Diplomacy), rather than a dysfunctional socially manipulative one.  It is what it is and it's not masquerading as something else.  To play, you buy into the struggle constructively.  Notice what happened when Ryan Macklin had a momentary disconnect from the purpose of play.

It sounds like you're not story-boarding your way through your play sessions.  It also sounds like you engage directly with the scenes that you are creating.  But I'm not talking about those types of play sessions.  I'm talking about the ones where the players sit around and discuss all their options without actually framing a scene, stating actions that become part of the SIS, and so on.  Getting caught up in a cycle of planning and then eventually, kind of, sort of deciding as a group what should happen in a "scene" is what I'm referring to story-boarding.<br/><br/>[...]<br/>Jan, the "connection between the scenes" that I'm talking about has to do with taking pre-narrated or planned scenes out of the ether and into the game itself.  There has to be a context that is created amongst the players for a scene to matter in a story.  You're referring to something altogether different -- the narrative link between two things in a story.

(And sorry for asking about examples for games - I just realized that you already mentioned that you don't want to point your finger.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite><br/>I'm not sure what you mean by "story focus."  Can you help me out here?  I'm not sure I can answer your question otherwise.</blockquote>\nFair question. I was just trying to paraphrase the initial distinction between advocacy and authoring, thereby presuposing that someone who is more into authoring is mainly motivated by creating an exciting narrative, whereas the player who advocates his character might enjoy a good story but opts for the interests of his character even if this might be criticisable from a narrative point of view. In other words: what I meant with story focus is a style of roleplaying that emphasizes the creation of a good story (whatever that is), a style in which decisions about how to proceed are justified by one's considerations about good storytelling as opposed to considerations about the interests of a particular character (an approach to the game that I thought was labeld advocacy).<br/><br/>However, after you made clear that you define story-boarding as an activity that is constituted by an irritating form of social conflict, it is much less disturbing. As I understood some of the coments, someone who plays with a story focus (in the sense I just tried to explicate) is story-boarding and therefore is usually a social jerk. But that's not what you wanted to imply as I can see now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229599/#Comment_229599" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T09:25:15+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  9:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know Tim.

I use it to to describe a lot of pre-narration, negotiation and revision without authority over particular fictional elements, and the absence of grounding scenes in play as opposed to discussion. If the mechanics of a game mandate or encourage these sorts of things, then in my experience, play either devolves or proves unrewarding in the long run.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nWell, I don't know about counter definitions...its not like there's a good dictionary for these sorts of things.  But I can point to the place where I see the "defined pretty narrowly" part in your definition.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">pre-narration, negotiation, and revision</div>\n</blockquote>\nThis I can buy.  One player says "ok, this is the scene where John first confronts his father about his alcoholism" and someone else says "ohh, but right in the middle that when they're interrupted by the cops looking for Joanie".  Sure.  That's storyboarding a scene.  It may not be everyone's preferred cup of tea but it's extremely functional and largely how we set up scenes for our last game of PTA.  I won't accept a position that says this sort of play is dysfunctional, bad, or not roleplaying.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">without authority over particular fictional elements,</div>\n</blockquote>\nhow did this get to be part of the definition of story boarding?  I agree its weak...I'm all about assigning authority over where the bucks stops. But there is nothing intrinsic to story boarding that requires a lack of authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you were to say:  "When storyboarding is done in an environment where no one has authority over a particular fictional element...&lt;bad stuff happens&gt;"  I would agree.  That would be "Bad Storyboarding".<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">and the absence of grounding scenes in play as opposed to discussion</div>\n</blockquote>\nagain agreement.  As long as we're talking about ways in which story boarding as a technique gets ruined.  The above scene setting discussion only works as long as the next thing you do is plunge down in your characters and play it out.  It has a bit more of an "acting" vibe...in the sense of being an actor playing a part and taking direction from a director about how to play that part in this scene...but its in no way non-functional.  If you don't do that...then yeah...weak.  But again...why would you intentionally use a bad form to define what story boarding is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really disagree with the concepts you've espoused but I do disagree with how you've chosen to label them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm saying:  here is this technique called Story Boarding and it works.  And yes here are a bunch of ways you can do it wrong that produces crappy play (just like any other technque can be done wrong).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you've done is taken those wrong things and made them part of your defintion of what story boarding is...which is why you can say you don't think PTA or Universalis are story boarding games.  Of COURSE they're story boarding games.  But they're story boarding games done right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is more than a semantic quibble because otherwise we're not even talking about the same thing when we use the word.  I don't think ANYBODY has ever said "I like story boarding as a technique" and meant what you say above by that word.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also tangentally...and I don't mean to pick nits here, because I really don't disagree (substantially anyway) with your core position...but you can't say this:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I thought I made it clear that what I'm trying to describe is something I personally consider poor game design. By definition, what I'm saying is going to step on some people's toes. I'm not trying to be insulting. Honestly, I don't consider this a discussion about preference per se. I'm interested in solving what I perceive to be a real problem in certain play</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nand then turn around and say this:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I consider the above more or less troll-baiting. No one is saying that what you're doing is "wrong." I'm interested only in talking about specific instances of play that are either (a) unrewarding because the players are disengaged from the story or (b) dysfunctional because play is dominated by social jockeying at the table.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229628/#Comment_229628" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T11:17:05+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 11:17AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: sage</cite><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><b>Wait</b>, something is wrong with authoring?

I mentioned before, Universalis did this for me (I'm sure it works for others). <br><br>I also think you're exaggerating a little. This doesn't mean the over-authoring player is locking everyone out, it means that they're very explicitly trying to be entertaining. Here's a not entirely made up example:<br><br>In a game of Lady Blackbird, as the crew of the Owl is siphoning fuel from the Hand of Sorrow, Kale's character says that Kale notices the fuel is actually somehow different from their normal fuel. Kale's player is trying to tell a story AT the other players, he wants to describe how he has to investigate this mysterious fuel, how there's some dark secret about where the fuel comes from, etc. He's not playing his character in an interesting way, and he's not adding strong things for the group to work with: he's telling a story at them. He has an idea for a plot that he'd essentially like to perform for the other players.<br><br>In this case, the player was me, and this happened in one of the first games of LB. I know, from experience, that it falls pretty flat. I think that it could have been improved if somehow ownership of the fuel element was given to another player, but I'm not sure how that exchange would have to happen. Maybe if it had been tied to some mechanical resolution (to make sure it shows up again, perhaps in someone else's hands), kind of like Danger in Danger Patrol, it would have worked.<br><br>This has kind of got me thinking about a corollary to the Czege Principle: <b>introducing anything that makes your own character shine without giving another player control of it is likely to break down play.</b> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div

I'm not trying to come up with a master definition.  After re-reading the original posts in this thread, I do stand by my comments that story-boarding will not accomplish the sort of honest connection and dialogue between players that Paul was talking about.  As a collection of techniques, which is really what I think it is, story-boarding will not always be outright dysfunctional, but it will foster less engaging play in the long run.  Why?  Because it's often about a struggle between the players as opposed to collaboration between the players.<br/><br/>Your comments about story-boarding first, and then playing out the scene strike me as downright odd.  That's not the way I play Universalis for example.  Although I know it's stupid to argue with you of all people about Universalis, playing the way you suggest just strikes me as boring.  It's pre-narration, and then a more involved re-telling of that same pre-narration.  There's nothing wrong with what your suggesting, but it does seem to me like it saps the power of the scene.<br/><br/>I'd make the same arguments about PtA, which is why I don't think that either are story-boarding games.  Framing a scene is not the same as story-boarding a scene.<br/><br/>Finally, I have no problem reconciling the two statements you pulled out at the end of your post.  There are certain games that encourage "bad" story-boarding.  And of course playing dysfunctionally is pretty much "wrong" by any useful definition of the word as it applies to this discussion.  Neither of those statements contradict my larger point that specific techniques can be avoided in order to encourage more meaningful, honest play.  Moreover, the latter quote of mine was made in response to specific comments that were, as I read them, trying to derail discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229653/#Comment_229653" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T12:38:29+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>pre-narration, negotiation, and revision</blockquote>This I can buy.  One player says "ok, this is the scene where John first confronts his father about his alcoholism" and someone else says "ohh, but right in the middle that when they're interrupted by the cops looking for Joanie".  Sure.  That's storyboarding a scene.  It may not be everyone's preferred cup of tea but it's extremely functional and largely how we set up scenes for our last game of PTA.  I won't accept a position that says this sort of play is dysfunctional, bad, or not role-playing.<br/><br/>I never said it wasn't role-playing.  I said it was socially unstable with out explicit rules that govern editorial control.  In your example what happens if the first player says "No, I don't like the idea that the cops interrupt" and the second player *insists* that they do.  Relying a good collaborative and negotiating skills is not enough because as I said in another post there's this middle ground where players are not socially disruptive but don't have the golden magic synergy of a group who just groves on each others content.<br/><br/>If you want to resolve such disputes mechanical, like say using a Stake-ish mechanics like, "Do the cops show up?"  That might work but I suggest it makes the game competitive at it's heart.  It's about gaming the system such that your story ideas are favored over the others.<br/><br/>It's much, much simpler to invest individuals with editorial power with well defined limits.  In Spione each player contributes ONE significant thing to the fiction which is considered provisional until it's made concrete in a Flashpoint (or through defacto acceptance).  In Dirty Secrets everyone can contribute but the current Authority has final say over things that are not the Investigator while the Investigator has final say over himself.<br/><br/>Without *explicit* Suggestion/Acceptance systemic components Story Boarding is socially unsustainable -- no check that -- ALL role-playing is socially unsustainable without systemic Suggestion/Acceptance components.  My beef is that, as written, Primetime Adventures has no such systemic components at the Story Boarding level.  Maybe when you play it your group has consciously or unconsciously ADDED those components but they're not there as written.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229656/#Comment_229656" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T12:48:24+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:48PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Without *explicit* Suggestion/Acceptance systemic components Story Boarding is socially unsustainable -- no check that -- ALL role-playing is socially unsustainable without systemic Suggestion/Acceptance components.

Players request scenes (set, agenda, type), and then the Producer frames them.  Then the Producer runs everything outside the protagonists.  I'm confused where the authority structure breaks down.

It's because they're about one of the most fundamentally painful aspects of human interaction: how people control each other. I'm going to be honest, I've come to dislike playing Primetime Adventures. Guy Shalev recently told me our most desired reward is human care. And I think he's right. Primetime Adventures trains us, via the Fanmail mechanic, to directly seek the appreciation of others. And in play, players really chase that reward. You can feel their eyes on you as they're playing out their scenes, pursuing your gift of appreciation, doing their best to provoke your reaction. The extrinsic reward of appreciation by others, when formalized, supplants the intrinsic rewards of character play. You can tell they'll twist their character however they need to for the reward of appreciation. And with the direct pursuit of this reward validated artistically, by the designer and by actual play posts, and socially, players go on to pursue it in other games with the narrative controls afforded them by those games.<br/><br/>(And it's actually worse than that. Not only does Primetime Adventures train us at controlling each other, it has us telling our controllers we like it.)<br/><br/>This is what I mean when I use the phrase "authoring at each other": we use narrative controls in games with a focus on extracting appreciation from the other players, not primarily in service to the creative experience of playing a character for artistry, personal enjoyment, and discovery. I don't think it's directly synonymous with "not leading with the fiction".<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229676/#Comment_229676" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T13:38:18+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>If you want to resolve such disputes mechanical, like say using a Stake-ish mechanics like, "Do the cops show up?" That might work but I suggest it makes the game competitive at it's heart. It's about gaming the system such that your story ideas are favored over the others.</blockquote>\nI don't see why this would inherently make the game competetive.<br/><br/>But, beyond that, I'm mystified by what your play group must be like. On one hand, they seem to be able to advocate for characters which are set up to be in conflict presumably, and can handle outcomes which in fact don't favor their advocated for character. On the other hand, they seem to be incapable of handling any differing opinion on the real peopple playinng level without falling into some sort of super aggro competition. And, then, layered on top of that, there seem to be general points about connectedness and honesty between the players, which strikes me as being an odd sort of concept given their inability to play together when given the opportunity to actually interact as real human beings.<br/><br/>But let's take the Cops Arrive Mid-scene example. What happens when someone does challenge that, and some sort of roll off is made ( or whatever) to decide whether it occurs or not? I mean, let's say there was a roll off ( or whatever) and the roll indicated that the cops would not in fact arrive mid-scene.<br/><br/>How does the player who was advocating for police arrival then react in your experience? I mean, do they keep trying to wheedle things back around for the cops to arrive anyway in some fashion? Because, yeah, that does sound childish and annoying, and I could see that sort of behavior very muuch detracting from any sort of fun in-fiction play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229677/#Comment_229677" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T13:43:46+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok,  there's way too many different topics being discussed here and way too much shifting the goal posts around to keep up with.  There's an unfortunate amount of telling other people they're playing wrong and then when called on it saying no I was talking about some other thing.  I'm not interested in engaging in any of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is what I'll say to summarize my position and then I'll bow out and let this thread wrangle to its inevitable ugly conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a whole lot of personal preference being expressed in this thread, that AS a statement of personal preference I have no disagreement with.  Would likely even enjoy playing that way myself...probably have.  But its not being claimed as personal preference its being expressly stated as some universal truth of roleplaying.  And this.  This is bullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd a "for me" to every sentence Tim and Jesse have said in this thread and you'll get no disagreement from me.  But try to tell me that "story boarding" as a collection of techniques fosters less engaging play in the long run...as a universal truism...and I'll look you in the electronic eye and say you're full of it.  Just as I've looked Ron in the eye when he was condemning explicit Stake Setting techniques (the earlier variation of this arguement) and told him he was full of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very first human to stand up around a campfire and tell a story to his clan mates used story telling techniques to elicit emotional responses from his listeners.  Every novelist and script writer worth their salt has done so.  The direct manipulation of story as an artifact in and of itself has been used throughout history and continues to be used on stage, film, and paper...because it works, works well, and produces powerful results.  Trying to tell me that we're not allowed to use such techniques when we roleplay is bunk.  Of COURSE they need to be modified to fit the new medium...just like every technique borrowed from one medium to another has to be.  But to say such techniques automatically lead to less satisfying play is such complete and utter nonsense that its ridiculousness should be self-evident.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229679/#Comment_229679" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T13:45:22+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert,<br><br>I certainly left the session with a bad taste in my mouth.

For me, fan mail is an expression of appreciation that is welcome but not sought after.  I don't let it impact how I play, because I know what I want out of playing.  Then again, I tend to see PTA's conflict resolution mechanic as its least important tidbit, and that's what fan mail is used for, so having or not having another card is not something I strive for at all.<br/><br/>Think about this, though.  All roleplaying can do this.  It doesn't have to be fan mail; plenty of people play for the cheers or the claps or smiles that occur as a reaction to their input.  As you said, it's human appreciation, and that's expressed in the presence or the absence of fan mail.  In the years I played online, boy did I see many people who primarily played for the kudos they got about their writing "skill" by other players; no mechanics of any kind involved.  <br/><br/>It's a personality thing, really, and while RPGs provide some structure there, I don't quite think we're trainable lab rats to the degree that you're implying <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229692/#Comment_229692" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T14:46:27+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  2:46PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, to clarify just one little tidbit \u2014 does PTA make you uncomfortable because you feel like you have to pursue others' appreciation, or does it make you uncomfortable because you feel like everyone is looking to you to recognize their contributions?

So much design (XP, Fan Mail, Artha) is focused on different flavors of "cookies" for players to promote modes of play the designer wants to see, either as part of an artistic vision or because they think play is most enjoyable when those modes/behaviors are followed while playing. Maybe I'm like one of those people that think "advertising doesn't influence my purchasing decisions," but those design principle cookies mostly fall on deaf ears (tastebuds?) with me.  Hell, I can't even be bothered to record my tests in Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>Fan Mail in PTA seems to me to be much more about promoting active listening and engagement when you are out of the scene. I don't give a damn about receiving Fan Mail, and I doubt most people do. I do want to give it out as a flag though saying, "Yeah, I like that direction.  I'd like to see more of that kind of thing." <br/><br/>Playing for the appreciation of others rather than one's own enjoyment or discovery?  Maybe true for some groups, but not, I think, for me and mine.  But if it is partially true I guess I'm not overly concerned about it.  I'm someone who considers it possible that purely altruistic actions may not exist, much less some kind of artistic purity.  Why do any of us do anything? It's like there's a pure form of role-playing for good motivations on one side and then there's wanting to be evaluated as a good/contributive player and if you do seek human care and that's somehow an unworthy, even dangerous goal? Because it's not about the "art?" If DeNiro or Streep ever worked even in part to perfect their craft to seek the approval of others, is that a bad thing?  Are they slaves to their controllers?

I can't even process your premise, that "trad" games are built mostly on rules-in-abstract, especially given the longstanding strain of criticism that they're built mostly on "GM fiat".<br/><br/>But to skip ahead a few steps, that's really my point--some sort of "fiat" is always needed. In Polaris, you've got "free play". This isn't "nothing important". It ought to provide context for any conflicts that take you into the resolution system.<br/><br/>I haven't had especially good experiences with story games, and I sense that's related to what Paul and Jesse are talking about. Although, it's not necessarily the fault of the games (I'll give you that, Ralph) so much as a culture that mistrusts interactions that aren't mechanically mediated and regulated. I mean that there's a strain of argument that takes "say yes or roll the dice" to the extreme of never finding it acceptable for anyone to say "no" lest a player be deprotagonized. Whereas as I've suggested in the past in reference to <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=169918" rel="nofollow">The Mountain Witch</a>, the games would probably work a lot better for me if they were prepared and run in a more traditional fashion, although using the native (rules-as-written) mechanics as a sort of "last resort" when the logic of the situation failed to provide an obvious answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230093/#Comment_230093" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T12:39:38+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 12:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2009 7:39PM by komradebob.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elliot:<br/><br/>I thought rolling the dice could then produce the "No" result, that kinda being the point of "Say yes or roll the dice".<br/><br/>Then of course there is table veto power written into at least some rules.<br/><br/>edit: Unwhispered after EW answered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230104/#Comment_230104" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T13:41:22+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  1:41PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this the part where everyone jumps in and points out that fiat =/= discretion?
