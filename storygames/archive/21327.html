Of course a GMless story-creation game like Shock is going to be much, much less GM-driven than a game that actually has a GM.<br/><br/>Apocalypse World itself (can't really say for the various variations) is about as player-driven as games like TSoY or Sorcerer or, you know, pretty much any other GMed games out there. I would in fact be intrigued by some counter-examples of games that have a GM yet are somehow, in some sense, more "player-driven" than Apocalypse World and such are. Is there a way to be more player-driven than a game where the player creates the character they want, and they get to determine what the character's story is about, and they get to decide how they react to adversity on the way?<br/><br/>Then again, I do not disagree if you'll say that there are PbtA games out there that are notably traditional, simulationistic, GM-driven, or whatever other adjective we might pick to contrast with whatever it is that AW itself is. There's a bit of a range in what those games do, the mechanical framework is so loose that nothing in particular keeps the games "on message" in this regard. You want to make a GM-driven game with those mechanics, you can surely do it without any difficulty. I've only skimmed a few of them, but even e.g. Dungeon World (one of the few I've read cover to cover) is practically in a different county compared to AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466988/#Comment_466988" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-13T17:07:06+00:00" title="October 13, 2017  5:07PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Eero that to a certain extent you can't have a game with an actual GM (Who basically controls EVERYTHING that is not the PCs) that isn't going to give that player more ability to drive play than the others - at least, relative to a GMless game where all players are functionally equal.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, we just had a thread about how the GM isn't supposed to really prepare much of anything for an AW game, so compared to a lot of games, the level of GM "driving" is quite low.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466989/#Comment_466989" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-13T17:50:23+00:00" title="October 13, 2017  5:50PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find AW to be about exactly as "player-driven" as AD&amp;D, with the only exception being that I'm forbidden from making up anything prior to the first session.

You can play Dungeon World as a just-in-time, psychodramatic sandbox, or you can put the players in Tomb of Horrors.

GMed games, but it depends on how they're played, the particular game, etc.\u2014they're much closer to traditional games then to Shock:. I do think there is a space for game designs to go further in the collaborative story game direction, where one ends up more in the middle. <br/><br/>For example, I have a game idea I'm working on that is kind of a collaborative story game and PbtA/Fate RPG hybrid. Think of something akin to the probative questions that are part of PbtA games; asking a series of leading questions that eventually gets into world-building from the perspective of the thoughts and senses of the given PC. I also add a technique, which I call "passing the hot potato," which is kind of how the GM in Lady Blackbird asks questions for the PCs to fill in. <br/><br/>Also, during conflict resolution the PC gets to describe everything that happens narrativly if the role is a positive outcome, such as: "yes, and," "yes" and the <i>yes</i> part of "yes, but"...the GM can of course veto too big of an ask, also the GM describes negative outcomes. So an example of the "yes, but" might be: you are chased by a horde of zombies and are trying to close and lock a door to keep them out; the PC discribes the "yes" is that the door is tightly closed and locked, the GM discribes "but" is that as you look around the room you realize that a member of your party is missing. The PC can discribe much more of the narrative than in the example I gave\u2014it works similar to the Pool. I haven't discribed it well or given the best examples, but hopefully you get the jist. These type of games would obviously have a more improvish nature that trad. RPGs and would demand more from the players, but not as much as a collaborative story game.  <br/><br/>Anyway, I thought I would bring it up because I'm interested in bringing together the collaborative storytelling games with more trad. games in which you're playing mostly from a character's POV; I want to see the interesting spaces that can be carved out in the middle. Really, I'm interested to see if you can largely keep that character's POV feel while still contributing to the storytelling in a wider sense and what the best techniques to do so are. Of course, this character's POV stuff is subjective.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467007/#Comment_467007" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-14T10:49:47+00:00" title="October 14, 2017 10:49AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PbtA games:<br/><br/>* Have a basic GMed structure. This means that a GM who wants to "run the show" can, to a large extent. Notably, I once played AW with a GM like this and it felt VERY traditional.<br/><br/>* However, there is a strong culture of play growing around these games which is all about the GM ceding power to the players. (It starts with the no orep for the first session, asking provocative questions, and so forth.) <br/><br/>Groups that do this (in my limited experience, most groups did) create a much more collaborative form of gaming. Often, more than half of what's going on in play is based in some way on players' ideas.<br/><br/>* The rules have all kinds of spots - some obvious and some very subtle - where they cede the GM's power to the players. This really adds up over the long-term!<br/><br/>Some of this is just strong-arm conflict resolution (for instance, with the advanced "seduce/manipulate" move a player can just declare an NPC is now an ally, and that's binding).<br/><br/>Some of it is in the playbooks (the Hardholder gets to decide a lot about the setting, the Quarantine ends up deciding the nature of the apocalypse to a large extent, the Skinner can decide which NPCs are in love with him/her, and so forth).<br/><br/>* Overall, it's still a traditional RPG frame, but with a group that buys into all this stuff and embraces it, the effect is subtle but powerful.<br/><br/>By the book, the players dictate or decide much of "what kind of setting is this?", "what happened here?", "what are the important themes?", and so forth. Then they have various tools for pushing those further in play.<br/><br/>However, that's not strictly enforced, and each group can find a different balance of "empowerment". (As a simple example, consider: how often does the MC ask questions? That's not regulated, but it matters a lot.)<br/><br/>The structure of the rules will wreck a lot of stock "traditional" play. If you were to try to run a pre-written adventure, for instance, some of the playbooks would conflict with the ideas. Then some of their moves would mess up the "storyline" - read a person means no NPC can lie to them, seduce/manipulate can get the NPC to do something different... you cannot create an enemy they can't fight, and so forth.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467008/#Comment_467008" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-14T11:32:57+00:00" title="October 14, 2017 11:32AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, it's not about power.<br/>In my opinion there exists only two meaningful degrees of GM power:<br/>- the GM has <i>de facto</i> power over the rules (Trad designs)<br/>- the GM does not have power over the rules (any other rpg in existence)<br/><br/>By this I don't mean hacks and house rules that the whole table agrees to use.<br/>I mean games that put the GM in a position where it is ok, or even expected, for them to use or not use all the other game mechanics by whim, on a moment by moment basis. Here <b>the GM is the game</b> with more or less inspiration from whatever is written on a book somewhere.<br/><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/><br/>Second, it's not about power <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Looking at the original AW the GM has pretty much the classic powers: authority on the world and all its npcs and events, arbitration rights, ample space to create anything surrounding the PCs both in terms of space and time, etc. There are procedures regulating how the GM can mess with the PCs, but withing those rules the GM has ample latitude to act as they see fit.<br/><br/>What makes the game more player driven than others is that all this structure helps and encourages the GM to play in a mostly "reactive" way, using their own creativity to offer answers and fill the gaps, rather than coming up with their thing to be unloaded (with minimal adjustments) on the Players.It doesn't twist the GM's arm about it, but it creates a situation where doing so is much easier than doing otherwise.<br/><br/>So, as you see, the GM powers are not really reduces. They are just modulated on a specific frequency, towards a specific end. Simply, the events in the game are more driven by Player choices and actions than by GM prep and decisions; but the GM still has plenty of stuff to do!<br/><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/><br/>How much player driven are PbtA games in general... is a different matter.<br/><br/>I consider the original AW <b>played by the book</b> as pretty player-driven.<br/>The game procedures are clear enough, and if the Players themselves know the system, it gets even tighter and more performing, although having the Players keep the GM in check on the rules can still feel awkward and cause social friction.<br/>(unless the GM openly asks for this kind of facilitation and support)<br/><br/>Fate Core, with all its merits, is much less efficient in this regard, as it offers tools that could be used to have a player driven game, but in the end if you don't use them it's all the same :P <br/>In AW at least the system puts up a small modicum of fight if you misuse it.<br/>(I mean, if you really go off the rails the system <b>will</b> break, as it should, but unfortunately there is a non trivial amount of room for error)<br/><br/>And this is my personal problem with AW: there is enough ambiguity, grey areas and wiggle space that GMs can <b>easily</b> get things wrong without noticing it, or without understanding how or why their games suffer. Leading to games that vary a lot in terms of quality (as measured by stuff like the events of play being more or less tight, relevant, engaging, meaningful, well paced, etc).<br/><br/>Then AW descendants come along, and you can easily see how the vast majority of them moves away (maybe unwittingly?) from all that made AW actually great and back towards an even muddier, less clear, less efficient game where a damn lot of stuff depends (again!) on the personal graces of "<i>a good GM</i>". Anyone can measure this by looking at the many features of the original AW and comparing them with the same features in other PbtA games, noticing how less marked such features are:<br/>- less GM prep<br/>- less GM fatigue during active play<br/>- tight rhythm<br/>- bang driven action (which is another way to say Player Driven)<br/>- fiction first approach<br/>- etc<br/><br/>Of course not all PbtA games are directly comparable. Some designs are radically different and it would be like comparing apples and oranges. But in most cases that's not the case.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>So yeah. In my opinion AW is pretty player driven.

The simple test I use is: When there's a lull in the action, who kicks the game back into motion, the GM or the players? In AW it's stated quite explicitly: "Whenever there\u2019s a pause in the conversation and everyone looks to you to say something, choose one of these things [GM moves] and say it".<br/><br/>Of course AW is more more player-driven in this spectrum than traditional games, but I also consider Solar System and Burning Wheel more player-driven than AW. In both of those players can:<br/><br/>1) write flags that the GM should prepare for<br/>2) make those flags active, i.e. the GM can just ask "what do you do" when there's a lull in the action and the players can act towards their stated goals.<br/><br/>AW's first session procedure does this flag catching on the fly, but after that the situation develops organically and the GM has more authority to choose which kinds of fronts to create. The fronts then push the action and force the PCs to act. The GM can, of course, keep asking similar flag catching questions later on, but as Paul said, it's not enforced.<br/><br/>Clearly these are shades of gray, but in my experience these shades make a difference in the play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467027/#Comment_467027" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-15T16:13:48+00:00" title="October 15, 2017  4:13PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good analysis, Glowie!

But the game also tells you <b>how</b>. Or at least, AW does, and it is pretty effective too. If you play by the book, doing illusionism takes both great GM effort and very oblivious Players.<br/><br/>And that's the problem.<br/>AW is like tha, but the other PbtA games?<br/><br/>The more time passes, the more I see PbtA games lose all the good things that AW did, sliding back into Trad habits because of, in the end, a lacking design.<br/>I mean, this crazy idea got around that the PbtA structure is good for a "quick reskin"... you "just" come up with new moves, new playbooks, and by magic you have a brand new game, right? <img alt=":astonished:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/astonished.png" title=":astonished:"/> <br/><br/>But it's not as easy as it sounds. It never works like this.<br/>The PbtA structure is one of the most <b>design-heavy</b> things I have ever seen... either you play it as is, with just a superficial change of colour laid on exactly the original mechanics, or you are in for a LOT of design work.<br/>And it's often easy to spot when the designer just doesn't get how the AW system works, what the point of its parts is. In my opinion it is quite rare for a PbtA game to show actual design worth under the skin deep patina of a fresh new setting idea.<br/>And then someone else builds their own game from this imperfect copy.<br/>And someone else later builds their own game from the copy of the copy.<br/><br/>Someone on G+ posted a sheet that shows how PbtA games could be split by <b>generation</b>, and there are like 3 or 4 generations already.<br/>To my eye, again with exceptions, the newest generations have quite unclear procedures, the GM needs to do lots of prep work, sometimes even for the 1st session, moves don't "move" the fiction anymore, there is an increasing amount of constant negotiation at the table or, in contrast, the GM is directly and officially appointed as the final arbiter for the many many judgement calls that the fuzzy procedures end up requiring. This in turn, obviously, makes the game only as Player-driven as the GM wants / knows how to make it.<br/><br/>Personally I don't mind this explosion of PbtA games.<br/>I'm a firm believer in the fact that more production is better than less production, as ideas flow and here and there gems can be found <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/>But I wouldn't mind seeing a (starker, as I optimistically believe there is already) <b>evolution</b> of things, a movement forward instead of backwards, a progressive raise in the bar of these... <i>PbtA Heartbreakers</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467138/#Comment_467138" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-20T20:14:11+00:00" title="October 20, 2017  8:14PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2017 8:21PM by Peter_Perry.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DannyK" rel="nofollow">DannyK</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I've had people yell at me for hinting at doing prep for an AW game -- the rules don't say it's a no-prep game but people take it that way. </p></div></blockquote>\nThat's a common misconception, unfortunately. If you go to the G+ community for DW you'll find an insane amount of people who think that "play to find out what happens" means "no prep allowed", when they're completely different things. This stems, me thinks, from the various rulebooks not making the distinction more obvious/in-your-face (although it's there) and from Adam Koebel seemingly having a big dislike for prep and apparently preferring mostly to improvise everything on the go, with everyone contributing to the mix. This is also reflected in the design philosophy for most supplements for DW, like Perilous Wilds, which although well designed, I have a dislike for (e.g. I have a strong dislike for improvised dungeons). There comes a point for me personally where the "everyone contributes to the salad" approach tends to produce mostly chicken food.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467201/#Comment_467201" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-24T06:24:40+00:00" title="October 24, 2017  6:24AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess it depends on how you define power. I'm running Monsterhearts 1.5, and doing my level best not to prep, and indeed, I have NO idea how the final session will end.<br/><br/>But, I come up with things that will happen. Well, will very likely happen. E.g., the Werewolf is raised-by-wolves and flees to the woods to be with them without bothering to drop a hat. Okay, so I came up with a man living in the woods who was killing and skinning wolves. I had no idea who he was or what he was doing at that point, and when I had him shooting at the wolves to protect the Werewolf (as he saw a girl in danger from the wolves), all of that was playing as we played, not prepping.<br/><br/>And the Werewolf killed him and ate part of him.<br/>And the Queen helped clean up the mess, deciding that the story would be that the wolves killed and ate him.<br/><br/>And between sessions, I decided that the school nurse (on a first name basis with the Werewolf) was this guy's niece and would be all "kill the wolves".<br/><br/>And after that next session ended, I looked at what had happened, what the nurse now knew, and decided that she'd poisoned the wolf mother. This happened offstage, the dying wolf coming into the scene, and setting the Werewolf on the path of vengeance.<br/><br/>As far as I understand it, I followed the rules. There were enough 6-s for me to make that as a Hard move. I had established this was the school nurse who knew enough to know how to leave poison out for wolves, who wanted to kill the wolves. This did not come out of nowhere.<br/>As far as I understand it, in Sorcerer terms, I introduced a Bang and then backed the fuck off to let the players decide what would happen.<br/><br/>But I made that choice. I used GM power.<br/><br/>Or look at combat. Say the Werewolf gets into a fight with an NPC who's in the Queen's gang. I don't roll the dice ever. When the Werewolf rolls the dice, we read the Lashing Out move and say what this means, following the principles of Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>But, there are points in a combat where I act or react. I do not roll dice. I decide what happens, and -- barring objections from the players, which is an important caveat -- what I decide happens. What the hell is power if not that?<br/><br/>Or say the Witch has managed to tick off an NPC, not necessarily wanting to, the player not necessarily wanting to, but again, not objecting. And say this NPC is a physically capable bully, while the Witch is not.<br/><br/>I say that the bully accosts the Witch and hits him, doing, say, 1 harm.<br/>I say that the Queen's gang member punches the Werewolf, doing 1 harm.<br/>Or I decide one of these has a gun, doing more than 1 harm.<br/><br/>I'm presumably following the rules, the principles, the agendas. I've established the existence of this gun before firing it. I've established the bully is pissed off at the Witch and the kind of person who will fire that gun. I am, I hope, running a safe, sane, consensual game where the players WILL call me on my shit.<br/><br/>But again, what is this if not using power? And what is power if it isn't this?<br/><br/>This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm not sure how folks are defining "power", and whether we're talking something that is de facto bad or something that cannot exist if the folks on the receiving end consent, whether we're talking something that, like electricity, can be used for good or ill, but is not intrinsically good or bad, or whether we're talking about something else altogether.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467205/#Comment_467205" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-24T16:20:27+00:00" title="October 24, 2017  4:20PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> , what PbtA games got it right in your opinion?

You can prep loads of background material (locations, NPC motivations, what-have-you) and still have no "story script"/railroading/any idea whatsoever what's gonna happen from the moment the game starts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467237/#Comment_467237" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T19:44:10+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  7:44PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2017 7:46PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if you're coming from a perspective of collaborative freeform (e.g. fiasco), PbtA is very traditional.<br/><br/>However, if your persecptive is heavy "trad play", it's got some things going for it.<br/><br/>PbtA (at least the "core" games and AW itself; I have yet to see a descendant which has really clear directions for play - but I'm unfamiliar with most) is basically:<br/><br/>Traditional, GMed roleplaying, but with:<br/><br/>* some player-empowering rules and procedures (e.g. some moves give players decision-making power over important aspects of the setting),<br/>* clear player-empowering principles and agenda for the MC (arguably the most important but also the easiest thing to ignore), and<br/>* a culture of no-prep play and collaborative practices (largely because of AW's "first session" advice, I'd imagine).<br/><br/>It's still a GMed RPG.

Could you cite some of them?</p></div></blockquote>\nWhat follows are all very much <b>PERSONAL OPINIONS</b> on games I have played.<br/>But since you ask...<br/><br/>Unfortunately all PbtA games suffer from the same fundamental problems I mentioned earlier. The thing is, some are in better shape than others, but none <b>that I know of</b> are exempt.<br/><br/>In my opinion the original <b>Apocalypse World</b> and now its 2nd edition offer the cleaner and tighter rules. Even though, especially in the 1st edition, the "cool writing style" ended up being a big obstacle to understanding some portions of the text for a lot of people.<br/>But that's my golden standard for PbtA comparison.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b> (1st edition... I have not yet read/played the 2nd edition) is also good and doesn't fall too far from the tree. Although it completely fucks up the GM prep part, because reasons.<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World</b> is not terrible, it does a good job most of the time, but it further reduces the "quality" (for lack of a better word, please forgive me) in respect to AW or MH.<br/>What I mean is, a lot of important details get less polish and attention, or are intentionally made less important because of the D&amp;D-nostalgia factor.<br/>Not surprisingly, all these changes go in the direction of making the game procedures less clear, less unambiguous, less tight and supportive ... which means that the GM has again much more room for error, and much more pressure to be the one to make things right.<br/>Still nothing even remotely comparable to a Trad game, but definitely a few steps closer to it that AW.<br/><br/>And this is it for me.<br/>Most other PbtA focus 99% on designing Moves and new sub-systems that fit and support their chosen setting and color, giving for granted the basic underlying structure, thus introducing more and more sloppiness and errors and unexplained elements.<br/><br/><b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b>, as I remember it, should be on the same good level as MH. <br/><br/>But then <b>Monster of the Week</b> takes DW and further pushes it towards the land of the Trads :P<br/>Same does <b>The Sprawl</b>.<br/>Same does <b>Urban Shadows</b>.<br/><br/>Same does, unfortunately, also <b>The Veil</b>, which is a shame because the game is full of neat and interesting ideas, but the rules are SO badly written and unclear that the gameplay was truly hindered... somehow many moves and procedures felt very inspiring to read, but when applied in actual play they feel awkward to use.<br/><br/>Then comes along <b>Undying</b> and it manages to be the most progressive and the most regressive PbtA ever, at the same time. It's diceLess and it's focused on PvP and politics... but it is also VERY demanding on the GM, requires a ton of prep, asks the GM to make a LOT of game defining choices, and requires the GM to make a lot of critical decisions on the fly, some by design, some because of muddiness and grey areas.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" rel="nofollow">vini_lessa</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I'm with Eero here: PbtA can only be considered player-driven in comparison to other games in it's niche, that is, GMed or trad games.</p></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf" rel="nofollow">AsIf</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For my money, this is why so many people find AW to be not very different from trad games: Vincent's principles merely elucidated and codified all the things we already did.</p></div></blockquote>\nI agree, on both accounts.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>"Ok, I'm the GM.

Paul's admittedly exaggerating slightly in that he's mixing up the climatic plot-points of the first, third and eight modules. Also, of course demihumans are available in Dragonlance, so I don't know what Paul's on about with that [grin].<br/><br/>As Paul describes, <i>Apocalypse World</i> is at least less GM-oriented than a game like Dragonlance. It's not a negligible playstyle - many would characterize it as the most popularly advocated one in game texts from mid-80s to the end of the century.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467261/#Comment_467261" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-26T13:38:54+00:00" title="October 26, 2017  1:38PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Progressive compared to traditional games sounds about right.

Worldbuilding was a new artform we wished to explore, and our understanding of the game's view of "story" (existentially emergent, given the paucity of white box, though we later expanded into AD&amp;D) led us to build what people would later call "Simulationist Sandboxes".  We were modeling <i>worlds</i>, and that included both the variety and the <i><b>free will</b></i> of their inhabitants.  This seemed to go without saying.  My world was HUGE and would go on developing for ten years.  From that moment, any modules I acquired would be mere drop-ins, used to provide a potential destination within an under-detailed region of the worldmap, but since our worlds were so individualistic and our PCs were involved in their own self-driven exploratory sandbox storylines already, there would have been no real reason (or point) in using a railroady plotline even if I <i>did</i> use the module it came from.  <br/><br/>My definition of prep was like architecture: I designed spaces for players to use, but I couldn't possibly foretell what they would actually <i>do</i> in those spaces.  My role in runtime was mostly reactive, and mechanically supportive (even when fictionally antagonistic) toward whatever they decided.  As in real life, stories formed themselves, <i>in retrospect.</i>  And as in real life, there was always some kind of "moral" or "object-lesson" that could be drawn from a post-facto perspective (a fact I find philosophically fascinating).<br/><br/>So again, I was fortunate to have never run into the stupid kind of game you talk about.  And this is why it's easy for me to see AW as comfortably "trad".\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>All the "bad" things I do, I do for your own good, for the sake of everyone's enjoyment and fun.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe goals of enjoyment and fun always need to be defined in ways that suit the medium.<br/><br/>I gave a number of conference-talks to writers back in the early days of interactive fiction and CD-ROM adventure games, and their biggest problems and fears regarding interactive media had to do with "losing control" of plot.  Many writers seemed to have great difficulty seeing the design as an object-oriented network, created in such a way as to permit plot to emerge "organically" (within the functional and heuristic limits of the system and setting), as my D&amp;D experiences (and later, MUD experiences) had taught me to do.  Rather than creating lines between significant plot beats, the job of the interactive writer was to create <i>possibility:</i> sets of objects ripe with the potential for dramatic and procedural connection, and the more possibilities the better.  But this was not easy for all of them to see, or adapt to.  So IMHO, part of the problem is the legacy of that "traditional" or "classical" view of plot construction which we all recognize from literature and TV/film.  It's brought about by the combination of an old habit with a certain shortness of vision.  <br/><br/>But I suspect another part of the problem as time went by would be the deliberate lowering of the bar - a "dumbing down" of systems and supplements - in order to appeal to younger, less patient, less creative, less intelligent, and less philosophical (i.e. let's face it: larger) markets.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467325/#Comment_467325" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T16:47:36+00:00" title="October 29, 2017  4:47PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2017 12:08PM by Upstart.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" rel="nofollow">hamnacb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Does Dream Askew qualify?

Partly because, unlike some railroady GMs, I was actually eager for player participation, but also because all the alternative play styles I knew had plenty of downsides of their own.  <br/><br/>I think the key for us was that even if the GM was the authority on the game, the GM was never the authority on the human social event.  Everyone had a voice, and every opinion mattered.  It took the internet to teach me that that was <i>not</i> always the case in RPGs.  I still find that weird.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't find PbtA radically different on such fronts, but I'm sure its non-radical differences have a big impact on some groups.<br/><br/>Funny story: after my longest AW game had reached a sort of partial conclusion, the group requested a short continuation to wrap up some remaining threads, and one player specifically requested an end to No Myth.  She wanted a story to uncover.  I took over the GM reins and did my best to provide that, but a bit of a clash developed between the One Interesting Thing To Address and our habits of letting these characters set their own directions on a continually evolving basis.

And maybe they did not really know about the wizard plans, or just plainly underestimated the "puny human" potential for disaster.<br/>In all of this, low level agents from both courts, and the people around them, got caught in a web of schemes and favors and secrets.<br/>Enter the meddling PCs, blindly doing their own little things and getting gradually entangled into this invisible web right up to a dramatic season end, when the ritual finally happened and explosions and storms and epic battles happened.<br/><br/>All of this was discovered by us, the Players, one tiny bit at a time.<br/>All of this was "prepped" by the GM in the most basic PbtA way... throwing on the table ideas on the fly, following the PC flags and actions, and making sense of whatever happened <b>post facto</b>, between one session and the next, shaping it up a bit with some prep work.<br/>Most of the more complex elements where actually random shit that was <b>later</b> normalised into the evolving story by the GM.<br/>Since we were not continuing the campaign beyond its epic finale, we had our GM spill the beans about the backstory and the prep work he had done. So we know <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This is pretty much the plot of an average Dresden Files novel.<br/>Is this "plot enough" for your Player friend, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> ?<br/>I have the feeling that the answer would be "no".<br/>Because the plot is not his true problem, in my opinion. Of course I am speculating here, and maybe I'm totally off track... I don't know your player. But I have a feeling I am not too wrong about it.<br/><br/>Why?<br/>Because I think that the problem is a matter of <b>authority</b>. Or actually, the <b>illusion</b> of authority. The belief that one source of narration is legit, and all others are not.<br/>Which maps perfectly to the dichotomy Myth-vs-noMyth. Which in my experience is a <b>false dichotomy</b>, an illusion, a self suggestion on the part of the Player.<br/><br/>If the GM says so, it's ok, it's valid, it's accepted, it's a surprise you discover.<br/>If another Player says the same thing, then nope, it's not good, it's not the same, it's not surprising.<br/>A game like AW <b>undermines this illusion</b> by showing some of the stuff that the GM does behind the screen ... and now even what the GM says is not good enough anymore!<br/><br/>In practical terms the Players have no way to know if what the GM describes comes from a script they prepped, from the memory of reading a big published book, or from improvisation.<br/>But now that the GM's word is put into question the line separating what is <b>perceived</b> as solid fiction and what is not starts to blur.<br/><br/>So the GM improvises stuff on the fly? Nope, not good enough.<br/>But is it good enough if the GM has the idea not now, not on the fly, but previously, during a previous scene?<br/>How about the start of the session?<br/>How about between one session and the other?<br/>How about at the start of the campaign?<br/>How about from a notebook the GM wrote imagining a future campaign?<br/>How about from a printed book existing outside of the GM's head?<br/><br/>I actually met, back in the day, Players that deemed "less fun" to play if the adventure wasn't an official supplement. Or that would frown at any deviation the GM did from the game materials as written (talking about fictional content, not game procedures)(one very vocal episode happened during a short lived campaign with the <b><i>SLA Industries</i></b> rpg).<br/><br/>I've met, in more recent times, Players that would get upset (not angry, but visibly uncomfortable) at the suggestion that the GM might describe stuff not because of their own spontaneous creativity, but because of game procedures. And do so in a weird sort of "<i>don't ask, don't tell</i>" way... like... they would play fine and enjoy the game, but if afterwards we ended up commenting on how the game produced this or that effect/event, with the GM pitching in on what was prepped or not... then this kind of conversation, this peeking behind the curtain, would trigger the Player.<br/>Strangely enough, the idea of the GM following to the dot a published adventure supplement did not faze that Player one bit o_O<br/><br/>So, personally, I see this request of "<i>please stop with the noMyth stuff</i>" as an attempt to use the social contract to repair the rent veil of the illusion. The GM promised they won't make shit up, so I trust them, so I can believe again that everything comes from whatever I consider an <b>acceptable source of truth</b>.<br/><br/>It's an bizarre and interesting behaviour, to me. Mostly because it feels so alien from how my mind works. At least, on the gaming table. I guess it's hard to notice this kind of self-deception when you do it to yourself :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467334/#Comment_467334" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-30T08:53:21+00:00" title="October 30, 2017  8:53AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Fair enough, "No Myth" was a lazy shorthand on my part.

It's a work in progress (and possibly useless).<br/><br/>1) Carefully democratic: No one has read the game text before the session, and the players read it together and figure out the whole game on the spot. Alternately, all players have roughly equal amounts of material only they are privy to before the game. I don't know any examples that demand this, but some games are designed to accomodate it.<br/><br/>2) Prep power: No GM, but the facilitator of the session is familiar with the game and is typically the final authority on rules. Most GM-less games are played like this, I imagine.<br/><br/>3) Rule-bound GM: The GM is technically bound by rules just like the players are. Burning Wheel is like this, I understand.<br/><br/>4) Unlimited GM: The GM is in charge of the game, and the rules are just a toolbox. Trad RPGs are typically like this.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of drifting and uncertainty going on in between 3) and 4). Often I feel like PbtA (and indie) games are written to work as rule-bound, but end up being compromised or unlimited in practice, maybe because players are so used to the unlimited model, and it's an easy way out for the GM.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467350/#Comment_467350" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-30T21:52:36+00:00" title="October 30, 2017  9:52PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2017 9:54PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So, personally, I see this request of "<i>please stop with the noMyth stuff</i>" as an attempt to use the social contract to repair the rent veil of the illusion.</p></div></blockquote>I know exactly what you're talking about!

I see this as the main cause for our gaming outcome.<br/>US encourages heavier GM prep, more dot connecting, more GM loaded info.<br/>And the moves push this even further: there is one move where you basically establish on the fly PAST connections to any relevant NPC you get in contact with.<br/>The more you play, the more everything and everyone gets networked and connected.<br/>By the end of our 10-ish sessions campaign, what started out as random strands and individual goals had become a tangle of plot lines converging to a common climax.<br/>In our after-campaign chat the GM made it clear that he was "gently" pushing in that direction, and how the system allowed him to do that... like... you DO play to find out, and even near the very end we were ALL getting surprised by new info and revelations (GM included)... but then whenever it made sense, whenever there was possibility within the emergent story, the GM would go in the direction of dot-connection rather than exploring new unrelated paths.<br/><br/>AW doesn't do that. AW is all about the <b>human feels</b> brought up by the circumstantial action and violence. It's meant to produce a simpler but more visceral story.<br/>Still, you can have plenty of depth there too!<br/>Like...\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>We had no multi-stage background scheme, just some diseases spreading and hostile outsiders encroaching. The plot-in-retrospect was entirely about what our characters made for themselves, not about what some ambitious NPC had in mind.</p></div></blockquote>\nFrom just that I could ask a bunch of stuff:<br/>What was the nature of the disease? Was it natural? Where did it came from? Who took advantage of it? Did someone spread it on purpose?<br/>Who are the encroaching outsiders? What do they want? Who's collaborating with them? Who sees them as an opportunity? And in which way?<br/><br/>AW encourages the GM to ask this questions to the Players <b>through active play</b>. At best they are bangs, at worst they are plot leads. They COULD reveal some complex backstory, but only if it emerges as by-product of the actions of the PCs.<br/><br/>So unless <b>the Players</b> ask such questions and are proactively going about to find the answers... then of course the emergent plot will be very <b>simple</b>. Where simple is not a bad attribute, it's just what is better and fitting for a "<i>take action about this situation</i>" story rather than a "<i>unveil a complex chain of cause and effect</i>" kind of story.<br/>It's the AW style.<br/>Seems to me that your Player wanted more convoluted backstory, but <b>maybe</b> did not act in-game to get it?<br/>As Rafu put it, he was asking for a finished cake, not for the ingredients and directions to make one.<br/>Which to me is a nice way to say that he wanted to be an audience to your story.<br/>Which is just not how AW works, and as you've seen if you push it in that direction all the rest works worse and the overall end result just feels meh.<br/><br/>US (and I would also say DW, actually) instead encourages the GM to come up with their own answers <b>through prep</b>. The Players will then reveal the backstory and interact with it. And of course the level of detail is relatively low, so that new play can reveal new info that the GM can easily leverage to reinforce his backstory or assimilate to modify the yet undiscovered parts of his prep, according to the current emergent facts.<br/><br/>In my experience this stuff is anything but obvious to the Players and GM :P<br/>For reasons linked to the "PbtA degeneration" I mentioned.<br/><br/>AW1 and even more AW2 make a big deal of the <b>play to find out</b> thing, with the Principle and its explanation but most of all with a structure that (for the most part) supports this effect. I mean, all the moves and other moving parts do a good job of either supporting or at least not getting in the way of it.<br/>Cool.<br/><br/>But still people have a hard time getting it, I know I had, and need time and practice and corrections to actually get it, digest it, and really do it. It's not rocket science but it's a radically different approach from Trad gaming. Even for the more sandbox-y people.<br/><br/>Then comes along DW that fucks up a lot of things right here, in this already nebulous area of the game system. Maybe "<i>fuck up</i>" is not the right term, but it surely made a bunch of steps back towards the direction of Trad prep and plot handling.<br/>The Principles and their explanation <b>read almost the same</b>, but the overall structure is much friendlier to prep-heavy play.<br/>This in and of itself is a problem, as people think they are playing "PbtA style" (as if it ws the same thing across the board of PbtA games) and instead end up doing stuff that in AW would never fly.<br/><br/>It's no wonder there are "dungeon starters" for DW but there is no such thing for AW <img alt=":astonished:"

class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Upstart" rel="nofollow">Upstart</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Someone has probably done this before, but I tried to figure out some levels of GM power/player democracy in games. It's a work in progress (and possibly useless).<br/><br/>1) Carefully democratic: No one has read the game text before the session, and the players read it together and figure out the whole game on the spot. Alternately, all players have roughly equal amounts of material only they are privy to before the game. I don't know any examples that demand this, but some games are designed to accomodate it.<br/><br/>2) Prep power: No GM, but the facilitator of the session is familiar with the game and is typically the final authority on rules. Most GM-less games are played like this, I imagine.<br/><br/>3) Rule-bound GM: The GM is technically bound by rules just like the players are. Burning Wheel is like this, I understand.<br/><br/>4) Unlimited GM: The GM is in charge of the game, and the rules are just a toolbox. Trad RPGs are typically like this.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot of drifting and uncertainty going on in between 3) and 4). Often I feel like PbtA (and indie) games are written to work as rule-bound, but end up being compromised or unlimited in practice, maybe because players are so used to the unlimited model, and it's an easy way out for the GM. </p></div></blockquote>I think this is a good breakdown.  <br/><br/>I agree that there's some weirdness between 3 and 4.  In my experience, it's mostly that the group hasn't explicitly signed up for 4, so 4 has to masquerade as 3.  Trouble arises when differences between 3 and 4 show up -- some sessions suffer from breaking the rules, and others suffer from playing by them.<br/><br/>As for 2, I think what you describe is common, but there's a nuance that might be important.  The owner of the game tends to be the rules "authority" in the sense of the group's resource and guide to the rules, but they aren't some sort of decider.  This might be a different sort of "power" than in the other examples?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467392/#Comment_467392" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-01T00:53:20+00:00" title="November  1, 2017 12:53AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2) would be "Benevolent unconscious domination" ? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467501/#Comment_467501" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-05T18:53:24+00:00" title="November  5, 2017  6:53PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Then comes along DW that fucks up a lot of things right here, in this already nebulous area of the game system.

Whatever it is, if you are all having a good time, this is plain and simple "right". It's right for you, and nothing else really matters. There is no game-police, nor it should be.<br/><br/>But. As a designer. As the author of a game. The whole point of crafting a game system is to transmit to the reader YOUR vision of the game. To put into words and mechanics HOW YOU PLAY that specific game.<br/>In this sense, how YOU (designer) play the game is the right way, and any other way is wrong.<br/>And as a designer it is thus your RESPONSIBILITY to make your game as clear and understandable and functional as possible.<br/>Functional to the goal of transmitting/communicating "how to play this game".<br/><br/>So when I say stuff about playing wrong <b>I don't mean to judge</b> someone else's fun in a negative way. It's just not about that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>What I am doing is a critical comment on <b>the design of a game</b>, and the practical consequences I see coming from it.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I don't quite agree with this. In fact, Adam Koebel is known for hating <i>any</i> kind of prep. And I don't remember the rules substantially favouring prep over improvisation. What is it specifically that makes you see DW that way?</p></div></blockquote>\nComparing DW with D&amp;D, I would say his hatred generated a very effective game. It's faster, lighter, meaner, better. I would vote for it any day <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But comparing DW with AW, to name a very close relative, I would say that the effect is quite the opposite. Maybe not dramatically so, but still noticeable to me. It increases the weight on the GM's shoulders and, among other things, it increases the amount of GM prep possible, of not strictly required.<br/><br/>To be honest I can't point a finger to a single sentence in the rulebook, or a single mechanic, and say "<i>Here, there, this is the problem</i>" ... it is more of an aggregation of many small details that all together contribute to making DW less effective than AW in teaching the GM and the Players how to properly run the game.<br/>It's like... the game is more lax in accepting behaviours from both GM and Players that in AW would never fly, if you bothered to follow the rules at all.<br/>Which might actually be by design... I mean... they might be related, but in the end DW is not and is not intended to be a carbon copy of AW!<br/><br/>But, like...<br/>There is more bookkeeping, both for PCs but also for NPCs and monsters.<br/>The world is supposed to be handled in a more detailed way, with the specific rules for cities and their tags.<br/>Things like henchmen have too their own subset of rules.<br/>The way the "fronts" are created is not quite the same as in AW, and in my opinion it ends up producing a pretty different kind of campaign... one where a GM might think it is ok to prepare more stuff.<br/>You see?<br/>You can totally wing it and play with near zero prep... but while AW tells you that this is THE way to play and you are doing it WRONG otherwise... in DW this is not so clear, not so strict, not so... effective.<br/><br/>Also, how the first session is handled, with an action oriented "<i>in medias res</i>" approach instead of the AW "<i>one day in the normal life of...</i>" approach, has its own repercussions.<br/>Seems pretty harmless, and maybe even more fun.<br/>But it has consequences and ramifications.<br/>A guy like Adam maybe thinks nothing of it and just wings everything on the spot, depending on how the Players created the characters.<br/>I do the same and have no problem with it.<br/>But I know, and have witnessed, many many people that don't feel comfortable with this formula and feel like they have to come at the table with "a good idea".<br/>Which leads some to actually prepare a starting quest.<br/>Which leads some to maybe make this starting quest the initial point of a longer campaign.<br/>Which is as far from zero-prep as I can imagine.<br/><br/>Case and point, the NEED to start the game with a quest in hand lead people to come up with things such as "<b>Dungeon Starters</b>", which <i>when done properly</i> are cool tools that gift  the GM with a pre-made small collection of flavourful locations and NPCs and, as they should be called, <b>bangs</b>.<br/>But when done not so properly, they can easily be plain and simple quests, old style.<br/>Which can cause all kinds of trouble for the GM due to how the Player-focused structure of a PbtA game works.<br/>Which can lead a new GM that is still learning how DW works (and usually comes from a heavy Trad background) to do the obvious thing that comes natural: ignore the awkward and problematic rules, you are the GM and you know better, <b>just have fun</b> (such terrible words &gt;__&lt;).<br/><br/>Just like when a GM/MC ignores the &lt;b&gt;rules on when they can make a Hard Move, how many are they allowed to make, which ones they are allowed to make, etc ... so that in the end the Hard Moves get out of the window as they are perceived "just as guidelines" that the GM/MC will never actually use because they know better, they don't need them, they have been running Rolemaster for ages and don't need no rules to instruct them on how to be a good MC.<br/><br/>It's all connected.<br/>One sloppy detail leads to the other, and all together they form a chain reaction that influences and shapes the way people play.<br/><br/>Now.<br/>Let's put this into perspective.<br/>It's not like DW is a scourge on the world of PbtA games, or that anyone playing it will suffer the full extent of the problems I described here.<br/><b>Let's not be dramatic</b> <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>But, as a designer, I can't help but notice these side effects of the game.<br/>And, as a Player used to gmLess games or to tighter PbtA games, a game like DW simply feels more grievous for the GM and more prone to be played wrong.<br/><br/>THIS is also what I see happening with subsequent generations of PbtA games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467694/#Comment_467694" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T16:35:09+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  4:35PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I agree entirely.<br/><br/>Part of it is the structure of the rules - and there are many examples: consider, for instance, that prep is required to create traps and monsters, which oppose the players. You could easily learn to improvise monsters with experience, but the game demands and rewards some prep here in a way that AW does not.<br/><br/>Another part of it is the premise of play. AW has a strong fictional premise, baked into the "setting" (and its themes) as well as into the playbooks:<br/><br/>There is a harsh world where you struggle to survive. Scarcity is a problem, and you have to fight to live. Each playbook gives some suggestions (some more than others) about what your problems might be and what your tools for dealing with them might be. For instance, it's almost impossible to prep content/material for the Hardholder or the Hocus, and start-of-session moves create a shifting "actuality" we all have to improvise to deal with.<br/><br/>The inherent danger and scarcity of Apocalypse World means that "playing out a day in the life of..." any given character is automatically interesting. Having to spend Barter to survive at the beginning of the session already puts this front and center, before you've even started playing.<br/><br/>In contrast, the "default story" for a D&amp;D-esque adventure is established heroes setting out on a quest. We can't simply "follow them around" and address the themes inherent in the setting. Unless the players are simply "inventing" a quest out of thin air, it's quite natural to expect the GM to do so (and the need to prep things like monsters cements that further).<br/><br/>There's no character type who starts the session with a condition like, "You're out of food, and the people you're leading are dying from disease. What do you do?"<br/><br/>There are lots of other examples. For example, some of the Hx options suggest immediate conflicts or dramatic directions to explore. In comparison, DW's Bonds tend to simply describe ongoing dynamics between members of an adventuring party. They are static rather than dynamic - that person tends to make fun of so and so, and that one is a mentor to the other one.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467702/#Comment_467702" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T20:30:23+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  8:30PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I couldn't understand how Fronts worked in AW until DW came out.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467705/#Comment_467705" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-15T20:48:14+00:00" title="November 15, 2017  8:48PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting; are they presented differently in any way?

I'm hard-pressed to find anything dramatically interesting in D&amp;D genre tropes which make it into Dungeon World.<br/><br/>Consider, for a moment, how much more bland the Dungeon World "classes" are than AW's playbooks or Monsterhearts' Skins. They give you very little to work with. Being a Werewolf is a metaphor for puberty, anger, and how physical strength can be leveraged into possessive relationships. Being a Fighter in <i>Dungeon World</i> means... you like to fight things and look cool doing it.<br/><br/>Same goes for other elements of the design. For example, most class moves are about developing mechanical effectiveness in combat (again, a D&amp;D trope) instead of <i>saying something about the character</i>. The basic moves say fairly little about the genre or style of the game, again, compared to those two games. "Go aggro" says something about the nature of Apocalypse World and how people in it relate to each other; Hack &amp; Slash is just about exchanging hit points with an enemy until one runs out and is defeated.<br/><br/>In short, for my tastes, <i>Dungeon World</i> takes all the most boring and limiting parts of D&amp;D and keeps them, while discarding or avoiding the quirky, interesting, intriguing parts. This applies fictionally just as much as it does in design.<br/><br/>As a result, it does a great job of what it set out to do: emulating D&amp;D tropes with AW-esque mechanics. But, in my opinion, it leaves the game as a relatively flavourless mix of elements which don't help create good characters or good stories. <br/><br/>Again, in comparison, AW and Monsterhearts both base their entire design on powerful thematic material (issues of survival, what it means to be human, belonging, growing up, etc) while <i>Dungeon World</i> seems to be, rather, just looking to recreate familiar D&amp;D cliches. <br/><br/>I don't think this is *bad* (it is, presumably, what the designers set out to do), and I bet lots of people dig it. It's just not for me.<br/><br/>In addition, I think those D&amp;D tropes and lack of thematic focus DO mean that DW GMs are much more likely to run it in a "traditional" style, for the reasons we've discussed above.<br/><br/>These are all matters of taste; I can criticize the game all I want for being uninteresting *to me*, but it seems that a lot of people are looking for exactly what it delivers, and that's great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467957/#Comment_467957" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T17:52:33+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  5:52PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen this criticism leveled against DW quite a bit (that it "doesn't utilize the AW mechanics to do something narratively interesting" or some such), but on the other hand most of the people I know who enjoy DW actually like it that way. Almost everyone I know who was big into DW a few years ago were long-time D&amp;D players who still loved the idea of D&amp;D but were feeling stifled by the mechanics of 3E, 4E, and/or PF. It's less that they wanted a system to do lots of heavy lifting to create a unique experience, than they needed the game to get out of their way. Whether this is the most optimal use of PbtA is questionable, but it did seem to work for a lot of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467959/#Comment_467959" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-23T18:00:23+00:00" title="November 23, 2017  6:00PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, DW isn't necessarily the game I'd go to for an exploration of deep themes or whatever, but it's a ton of fun.

Their previous experience was with D&amp;D3.5, and they <i>got</i> the difference. I remember one of them explaining to another GM about how Dungeon World is a conversation, and just being floored. Just getting them into that mindset of thinking about RPGs that way was, I think a real contribution.

I remember reading it and getting to the point where the Druid actually seemed most interesting, because I could sort of see myself riffing something-or-other about nature religions with it. It just barely crossed over the threshold of being something, instead of being nothing.<br/><br/>If one were inclined to, it would be possible to push the D&amp;D classes much harder in terms of dramatic identity, though. I've fiddled with this a bit in the context of <i>Dragon Union</i>, which is sort of a sister game to Dungeon World in many ways. For example, when you interpret "being the Fighter" in terms of battle trauma and the crucial flaws that violence brings to problem solving, it starts standing up as a dramatic identity. Similarly, one should be able to work out an identity of Thievery, of being a criminal outsider, as an actual big dramatic deal. So it's not impossible so much as just something that Dungeon World emphatically avoids - it defines the classes in a very whitebread, offend no-one way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468008/#Comment_468008" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-26T16:17:35+00:00" title="November 26, 2017  4:17PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arguably, the point of DW was/is to allow players to explore a fantasy world through the "neutral" lens of a cool/heroic/superpowered character.<br/>It's an action adventure game.<br/>It was never meant for dramatic play... and running it I found out how DIFFICULT it is to inject such content in the game unless both GM and Players agree, <b>out of the rules</b>, to make space and time for this kind of exploration.<br/><br/>The default DW rhythm and flow is:<br/>action -&gt; action -&gt; action -&gt; resource management -&gt; action -&gt; action -&gt; action<br/>I had to build my own moves to specifically break this flow and, at least during "downtime" moments, create space and opportunity and incentive to express something personal and human, rather than simply showcasing how cool and powerful and skilful my PC is <img alt=":astonished:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/astonished.png" title=":astonished:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468012/#Comment_468012" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-26T19:52:29+00:00" title="November 26, 2017  7:52PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that's exactly it.<br/><br/>I think the D&amp;D ethos has all kinds of room for colourful and quirky content - especially the phantasmagoria of the earlier editions.

Old School Hack is arguably a better design and more thoroughly done, but I was disappointed to see how much of the quirks and colourful touches of Red Box Hack had been removed to make for a more "game-like" experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473527/#Comment_473527" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T14:13:14+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  2:13PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't quite agree with this.

To the point: my statement comes from reading a comment by Adam in which he plainly says something along the lines of "f**k prep" (and it seemed clear to me by context that he meant any kind of prep.) He also stated on a more recent discussion that he later changed his views on prep somewhat, after designing DW. I don't know what the "timeline" of his thinking is, but it's not something I'm particularly interested in (I'm not a fan of his design work or of his GMing style).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't find the references and link them, but hopefully someone with better google-fu skills can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474101/#Comment_474101" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-21T02:49:05+00:00" title="May 21, 2018  2:49AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From what I've seen of Adam's preferred playstyle, he does "prep", but his "prep" is quite different from the "prep" you'd find in, say, a typical D&amp;D adventure module. Instead of scenes and encounters and adventure hooks, it's a loose collection of concepts, questions, and brainstorming. He'll think about possibilities and raise some questions, and then head into the actual game without anything nailed down, ready to improvise.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, of course; it's just my best guess from some of the "GM prep" videos I saw, and the resulting sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474105/#Comment_474105" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-21T08:44:02+00:00" title="May 21, 2018  8:44AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/><br/>Yeah, that may be the case, although he commented at some point about changing his views on prep, so I'm inclined to think that at some point in his thinking he did dislike prep of any kind.

If you go back to the Sorcerer RPG and look at how Edwards says to GM Sorcerer, it's all about how to prep without telling a story.  He had a lot of good tools for that, like the diagram on the character sheet and the "Bandolier of Bangs".                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474115/#Comment_474115" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-22T03:17:04+00:00" title="May 22, 2018  3:17AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.<br/><br/>I've done prep where you draw a map and you list every little thing in each room. I've done prep where you have a sequence of scenes, and all the little things which will force all the characters to follow that sequence of scenes. I've done prep where you create a number of factions or threats and then allow the players to discover them as they go. I've done prep where all you do is brainstorm and daydream for a while but don't write anything down... or even commit to anything! And I've done "prep" which is all just asking the players questions and writing down their answers. <br/><br/>There are even other forms of prep: one I've never done, but some people do, is practicing accents, bringing props, making costumes, and preparing sound effects or playlists or music.

Of the two who didn't make it, one's already seen it and was the person suggesting the rest of us watch it.<br/>Reading Le Carre's Spy Who Came In From the Cold, starting Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.<br/>Watching first hour of the BBC Tinker Tailor.<br/>Sending email about what we should discuss during character generation / setting expectations.<br/>Having the character generations / setting expectations session.<br/>Typing in 4 of the 5 character sheets to a Google Drive Spreadsheet.<br/>Talking with folks about handling specific issues.<br/>Typing up an explanation of the various moving parts for a friend who got information overload -- but during this, I figured out answers to questions about what to do in future legs, if we get that far, and if the situation hasn't changed to the point where these answers no longer work.<br/>Typing in material from the Director's Handbook about the 1977 leg that I don't think hold spoilers so the players can look at it. (Win conditions, stuff that's happened to date -- not a huge amount of material, but useful to have where folks can see it.)<br/>Agreeing to do this as two long sessions.<br/>Realizing I still need to plot out a skeletal outline before our first session, which is in a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>My prep for Our Ladies of Sorrow before the first session included:<br/>Deciding who was playing, when and where we were setting the first scenario, and having a character creation session.<br/>Since we knew we were using Trail, reviewing the conversion notes online for this, which involved writing out a summary, plugging in the Trail parts, and then rewriting it into a notebook, modifying the Trail conversion as I went. It is entirely possible that my notes are as long as the scenario.<br/>Writing love letters to the characters and being awed by the answers.<br/>Putting points on a map of Greenwich Village, which included arguing with Google Maps for a bit. This was probably the most concretely useful bit of prep I did, though all of it was useful.<br/>Typing up most of the handouts, modifying for the scenario being in NYC in the summer of 1963.<br/>Doing a lot of online research, more broad than deep, but learning that JFK is still Idlewild and liking the sound of "Idlewild".<br/>Spending far too much time staring at the borders of police precincts and trying to make the scenario default of "these are the two cops who'll show up at everything" make sense (figured it out).<br/>Getting a box of 120 crayons to draw some of the children's drawings that appear in the scenario.<br/>Doing the drawings and being amused while Josh writes a script to figure out the optimal configuration of the crayons in their box and then sorts by eye anyway.<br/>Coordinating the dinner order, as we shift from a cafe/diner to some do that, some bring in, some order Indian food, to one person brings in, and the rest of us order Indian food.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474136/#Comment_474136" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-23T09:06:39+00:00" title="May 23, 2018  9:06AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Lisa Padol" rel="nofollow">Lisa Padol</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Coordinating the dinner order, as we shift from a cafe/diner to some do that, some bring in, some order Indian food, to one person brings in, and the rest of us order Indian food.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nBest part of prep right here.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/permanewb" title="permanewb"><img alt="permanewb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/permanewb">permanewb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474408/#Comment_474408" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-03T04:02:13+00:00" title="June  3, 2018  4:02AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the reason Adam doesn't hate prep for SWN is because there's mechanics for prep for the GM to use between sessions.
