There's a Forge thread <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26644.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, though I've made some progress scribbling in my notebook that I need to mull over more and then type up.<br/><br/>Basically, it takes place in a world where ten years ago a bunch of one-way portals opened up and started dumping cute monsters like something out of a Korean MMO (think Maple Story and Ragnarok Online) into an otherwise normal contemporary setting. In a lot of places teenagers hunt monsters as a hobby and to earn spending money. The game is meant to be about high schoolers going hunting and trying to achieve mundane, human goals and having mundane, human drama juxtaposed with the absurdity of using swords and such made by Nike and Adidas to kill creatures that look like they escaped from a Dragon Quest game.<br/><br/>When I prodded Andy for his thoughts on it the other day, he said something interesting:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>My imaginary character is kind of a shy kid who kills monsters to buy books and music as his allowance sucks. Eventually he wants to go to college, but he doesn't know what for or why. He also wants to have a girlfriend, but hasn't really thought about it more than that. So he for the time being hangs out with some other kids who are making money for some reason or other for themselves.</blockquote>\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that "I would want to play this kind of character" could be an incredibly useful thing for a game designer to hear. Andy's character concept has me thinking that I need to deal with long-term goals in the game, and with directionless characters trying to find something to do with themselves.<br/><br/>So: What kind of Slime Story character would you want to play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169096/#Comment_169096" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T10:51:56+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 10:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 10:52AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd play a sensitive vegetarian boy or girl who tries to protect the monsters and gets really upset when they get hurt or killed.

He's very serious, and tries hard in school, but his "duty" to kill monsters makes it hard for him to focus there. He reinvests any money he earns back into his monster killing obsession, buying the next best sword that Nike just came out with, or the latest in Under Armour's OverArmour line. His obsession is both a draw for other people who find his brooding intensity fascinating, and a wall that keeps him from getting close to people, which allows for lots of teen angst and tension potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169761/#Comment_169761" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T21:18:11+00:00" title="September 17, 2008  9:18PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Waitwaitwait!
