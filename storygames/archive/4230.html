I'd like to ask a related question, but from a different perspective and posed it to players of said games. But first a little background...<br/><br/>Back in early February my group and I sat down to play Polaris. One of our number wasn't able to make it for our regular PTA game that week and it corresponded perfectly to the four players needed to play Polaris. What unfolded over the course of two sessions (yes we broke the rules!) was a story of family, revenge and tragedy, as the sons and daughter of Al Shain destroyed themselves under the subtle machinations of their fellow Knight Al Athfar. It was full of emotion and revelation as the protagonists uncovered not only the mystery of sins committed by their patriarch, but also each other. Needless to say it all ended in a Jacobean bloodbath, with which we were all very satisfied. <br/><br/>I consider it the most enjoyable role-playing experience I've ever had, to the point that at the time I said to myself and then the rest of the group, "<i>this</i> is why game."<br/><br/>However, the interesting thing is this: all the participants in that game, including myself, have all expressed that they have no desired to play Polaris again. Not because the subject matter was too disturbing or anything like that -- to the contrary. We simply feel that first story was so awesomely epic that we wouldn't be able to help but compare any further play to it.<br/><br/>I personally have a desire to see how the Zeal/Weariness, Novice to Veteran progression plays out as per the rules, but I'm overcome by the sentiments I described above.<br/><br/>Anyone else every have a similar problem with their favorite games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94750/#Comment_94750" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:37:45+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never.

Once the great secrets are revealed, why go back to it? Sure, Kult asks questions rather than gives answers, and you can adjust the answers and have a different setting and a new game experience, but there's still an aversion to go there.<br/><br/>Human drama, on the other hand, never gets old. I can't imagine having this problem with PTA or Sorcerer, for example, because they are both toolkits for telling stories with certain common threads but in potentially completely different contexts and settings. Same with D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I don't know Polaris that well, but from what I gather it is very setting-strong (which is good). For me, I could see that leading to a "we've now told the Ultimate Story" syndrome, where some big questions have been answered and the setting used to its fullest. It doesn't mean it's exhausted, but it means that the participants may not be up to the challenge of trying to tell an <i>even better one</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94775/#Comment_94775" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:15:17+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vasco Brown</cite>Anyone else every have a similar problem with their favorite games?</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.  <br/><br/>And yet, even though I might use words like "never", in truth it's more like "I can see myself never returning to this game again!"<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...cut to 2, 3, 5 years later:<br/><br/>ANDY: "Damn, that Polaris game was a lot of fun.

That shared Fate Aspect really is powerful. It was definitely the linchpin of our story and colored many of the decisions we made on how it unfolded. To overlook the significance of this one rule would really be a shame for any group planning on playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95025/#Comment_95025" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T08:40:51+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  8:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt... just to split hairs... would you play it again with the same guys... and a different seating arrangement?
