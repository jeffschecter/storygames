Interestingly, it also helped me learn to borrow ideas from the best...after all, the OTHER way to invent something is to improve/modify something that already exists.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S.

In the next 2 days I'm going to post a very basic intro to Usability Testing here and go into detail about how to encourage people to Think Out Loud since I know people have issues making that happen and I've have had great success in that area. <br/><br/>I'm excited to see what we can all bring together to share with the rest of Story Games! I truly believe basic Usability Testing is crucial, especially for RPG game text, to help communicate our games to new people. <br/><br/>For example, my cousin was truly confused whether she could play a female Mythender when we made characters. Note: Ryan mentioned elsewhere, part of the problem was that we only had the character creation chapter and missed then introductory text that added needed context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326920/#Comment_326920" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-30T12:10:49+00:00" title="May 30, 2011 12:10PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I come at testing from a different perspective (I worked in microprocessor design, trying to identify design problems, i.e. bugs, before the processors were manufactured in silicon) but I think I come to some similar conclusions about valuing unfiltered responses. When I give people feedback about their games I try to give them my raw reactions first (<a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=463&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">example</a>), because I come from a "file every bug" mindset -- there's no downside to identifying and tracking an issue as soon as it's noticed. A lot of people find it difficult to adapt to this way of doing things (e.g. people who just want "big picture stuff" before hearing about typos, etc.), but I think trying to get the people giving you feedback to self-edit and apply filters is risky (potentially hides issues), misallocates resources (it's hard to get people to read stuff, you have tons of time to analyze their responses), and can encourage people to color their responses in unhelpful ways (such as telling you how <i>they</i> would design something rather than how they're responding to your design). <br/><br/>I think the designer community would benefit if there was more of a culture of this kind of feedback going on. (I also think there are some entrenched ideas about how people in this community develop games in this community that make it hard, but maybe that's outside the scope of the thread).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327127/#Comment_327127" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T15:50:01+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  3:50PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna' weigh in a bit on user personas, which have helped me in both HCI and as a writer.  Creating user personas, which outlines a "typical" user from whatever category you are looking for, has, of late, helped me write to an audience.  For example, if user "Marcus" is an experienced gamer, I have to consider how I will communicated to him versus user "Ellen" who may have no experience with table-top RPGs, but loves things like WoW.  When I think about how I need to craft my text, I always always always have to consider how my target audience will respond to the rules AND the way in which they are written!<br/><br/>One of the great things user personas gives us is a way to predict what people already know.  If Marcus loves D&amp;D (and if I am writing to him specifically), I can easily omit certain elements of common knowledge from my game text (such as "what is an RPG?").  The wider your audience (even if it consists of only two or three personas that you developed), the less you can assume they "already know."<br/><br/>Interestingly, user personas can get very deep.  Consider this: Ellen loves to play WoW, and has always found it somewhat strange that the main rules of D&amp;D omit Goblins as a main race whereas her computer game does not because of expansions!  If I model my game on a specific race of creatures (let's say Goblins in this instance), I can add Ellen to my immediate user "pool" or what-have-you.  But, if I omit the Goblins, but promise them in an expansion, I can still consider Ellen part of my immediate pool because she is already familiar with the concept of expansions in the first place (and, she might even expect them!!!).<br/><br/>All in all, I hope these (disorganized) thoughts are helpful.  I'm doing a pretty bad job of considering my audience in this post, but I think y'all will forgive me...just never assume that your users will!!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327145/#Comment_327145" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T17:25:20+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  5:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 5:26PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is what I do for a living at the moment as well, though I don't have any academic background in usability.

There is a great deal of overlap but I just wanted to be clear what my experience was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Usability Testing, what is it?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nUsability Testing is a technique to assess how easy an interface is to use by testing it on the very users it was built for.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we mean by easy?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow easy it is for users to:<br/>\n&gt; learn basic tasks for the first time<br/>\n&gt; quickly perform these tasks<br/>\n&gt; remember these tasks<br/>\n&gt; perform these tasks without error<br/>\n&gt; recover from errors<br/>\n&gt; enjoy these tasks<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we mean by interface?<br/>\n<br/>\nInterface is a point where two systems or subjects meet and interact. Your RPG rule text is an interface between your players and how the game is played. Other RPGs interfaces include: character sheets, rule references, dice, cards, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we mean by users?<br/>\n<br/>\nAren't they just people? Doesn't users sound dehumanizing? A considerable number of people have a negative reaction to the word user. I think this is perfectly understandable although the intent behind the word isn't a negative one. When we say users, we mean the specific people our interface was designed for. For the sake of time, we don't just want to test an interface with anyone. If your game is a tactical RPG that uses maps and minis, you wouldn't want to test your game on someone who dislikes tactics. Who is your intended audience? Who do you want to play (i.e. use) your game? Those are your "users." Feel free to replace the word with audience or anything else as long as it is clear that you don't want to run a usability test and just any random person.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What\u2019s next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Usability Testing is not!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331715/#Comment_331715" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T13:28:55+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  1:28PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What Usability Testing is not!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nUsability Testing is not:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Gathering Opinions<br/>\n<br/>\nGathering opinions is market research. Usability testing is systematic observation under controlled conditions to determine how well people use an interface. You study and record how people use an interface. You don't draw conclusions by asking people's opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Design<br/>\n<br/>\nUsability Testing will identify problems but doesn't tell you how to fix them. Usability Testing is not a replacement for design. Although once you identify a problem and design a new solution, you can then use Usability Testing to determine how useful the new solution is.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. A Planning Tool<br/>\n<br/>\nUsability Testing can't tell you what your goals are and who your audience is. You need to define these things beforehand for Usability Testing to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How is Usability Testing different than Playtesting?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nUsability Testing is a form of playtesting but using a very specific set of procedures:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; determine what we want to test<br/>\n&gt; identify who\u2019s our audience<br/>\n&gt; identify specific priority tasks to test<br/>\n&gt; create natural scenarios encompassing those tasks<br/>\n&gt; recruit at least 3 uninitiated people<br/>\n&gt; record the test (notes, video / audio recording, capturing hand / eye movement, tracking stress levels)<br/>\n&gt; run people through "talking out loud" exercises<br/>\n&gt; run people through our scenarios<br/>\n&gt; take caution not to influence people\u2019s action (asking leading questions)<br/>\n&gt; create a report identifying problems discovered<br/>\n&gt; have a 3rd party confirm your observations by reviewing your recordings<br/>\n&gt; debrief with your designers<br/>\n&gt; decide what to fix<br/>\n&gt; fix before next round of testing<br/>\n&gt; test again using different people<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What\u2019s next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHow to get started Usability Testing your games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331920/#Comment_331920" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T13:03:32+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  1:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>In the meantime, here is a useful and easy book on Usability Testing:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy--Yourself/dp/0321657292/" rel="nofollow">Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems</a></blockquote>\nI immediately ordered that one on Amazon.

You don\u2019t know who should test your game. You won\u2019t know which test information to take seriously and what to ignore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are these answers important?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If you don\u2019t know what your game does and doesn\u2019t do, how do you know what feedback to listen to? You can\u2019t succeed, if you don\u2019t have goals. You won\u2019t know what direction to walk unless you know where you\u2019re headed. You won\u2019t know when to stop unless you know what your final destination looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If strategy and tactics are important to your game, why send a playtest copy to freeform gamers?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If you don\u2019t know what problem your games solves, how do you know what rules to write?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You can\u2019t please everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, no matter what you do, thousands of people will disagree with you. You can\u2019t please everyone. Fortunately, if you know who you are trying to please\u2026 you don\u2019t have to care what everyone thinks. If you reached 0.25% of people currently playing D&amp;D;\u2026 that\u2019s 15,000 people. A lot of design, not just game design, is about focus and eliminating anything that distracts from that focus. With focus, you know who and who not to listen to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you identify what problem your game solves, you can nail down whose problem you\u2019re solving. This is your audience. This is who you want testing your game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>I Can\u2019t Find Testers!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can\u2019t find anyone to test your game, that might be a warning sign to go back and revise what problem your game solves and for who. If people don\u2019t want to participate, maybe it\u2019s because your game doesn\u2019t solve a problem they have. Or you\u2019ve misidentified your audience and are talking to the wrong people. Or your audience is very busy and needs fair compensation to make testing worth their time. If you can\u2019t compensate them, maybe the project is too small to warrant all the time, energy, and resources dedicated to it as a commercial project and would be better off released non-commercially.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery roadblock you hit is a sign that you may need to rethink your strategy. It\u2019s a gift. It will force you to step back, sharpen your focus, and ultimately learn from your experience to make you even stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you find testers, be realistic about your expectations\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people volunteer to test and never come through.

Think small. Start with the absolute bare minimum rules your game needs to achieve its goals. Identify the top 1-3 things you need tested. Ignore everything else. Create scenarios that will allow testers to focus and test these top priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesign your scenarios so what you\u2019re testing isn\u2019t obvious to the testers. Your scenario might be, \u201ccreate a character\u201d but what you\u2019re specifically testing is \u201chow long does it take\u201d, \u201cis stat allocation frustrating\u201d, \u201cdoes character creation give the GM enough information to design an adventure.\u201d Don\u2019t tell your testers what you are actually testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's common to hand a playtest group an entire game, ask them to play multiple sessions, record everything, and send it to you when they are done. Are you going to listen discernably to 30+ hours of audio? Some designers will but I suspect most of us won't. There will be plenty of fast forwarding, unfocused listening, and many details missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven more importantly, what happens when they misunderstand a crucial rule the first session and then continued to play for 6 sessions under false pretenses? You could end up wasting your and their time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a user testing perspective, you will want to create test scenarios that are short. 1 hour for an RPG would be a good guideline. Focus on testing parts of your game: word creation, character creation, specific conflict or mechanical systems, etc. When Paizo tested the grappling rules for Pathfinder, they grabbed people, handed them the grapple rules, characters, and a map and said go! It's best to focus as much as possible, it will save you time and it will eliminate outside factors in longer play that may affect how your testers use the rules you are testing that have nothing to do with the rules themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Recruiting Testers</b><br/>\n<br/>\nRecruit testers who are the kind of people you want playing your game. If your game is tactical, don't recruit people who dislike tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTest each of your scenarios at least 3 times. Don't test a scenario with 1 person, find a possible problem, and then change the design. Instead, test the same scenario 3 times before changing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecruit uninitiated testers. Don't test a scenario 3 times with the same group of people. Use different people. In the world of Usability Testing, you always want brand new people who haven't tested any part of your design. In RPGs, it may be difficult to find that many people. At the very least, don't test the same scenario with the same people AND try to rotate testers. If you have no choice but to reuse testers, at least space the time between tests. Have group 1 test scenarios 2, 4, and 6 instead. Give them enough time to clear their minds of preconceptions. Especially since your game is going to change frequently. Those preconceptions could create problems that have nothing to do with your existing design.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What's Next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nRunning Tests\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331956/#Comment_331956" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T16:08:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  4:08PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If you can\u2019t find anyone to test your game, that might be a warning sign to go back and revise what problem your game solves and for who.</blockquote>\nI agree with this to an extent, but it can be dangerous to draw conclusions from small sample sizes. "Lack of interest" can be caused by quite a few different factors and diagnosing the true root cause can be really difficult.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>From a user testing perspective, you will want to create test scenarios that are short. 1 hour for an RPG would be a good guideline.

A lot of RPG design elements interact in subtle but important ways. Creating your own character, for example, can build investment in that character and affect how you approach conflicts, etc. "Unit testing" can do things that you can't do with full-system testing, but it also has limitations. With RPG unit testing especially, you're not going to have full controllability over the psychological state that players bring to the subsystem. Trying to test subsystems in isolation always involves tradeoffs, so people should go into the process with their eyes open. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>It's best to focus as much as possible, it will save you time and it will eliminate outside factors in longer play that may affect how your testers use the rules you are testing that have nothing to do with the rules themselves.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure if I agree with this or not. I'm tempted to talk about a coverage-based approach to testing as contrasted to a test-list-based approach, but that might be outside the scope of the thread. A lot of things about appropriate testing strategies are going to change based on what the limiting factors are (e.g. time, people, data analysis, etc.), so I'm still trying to decide whether some of the beliefs I have from another type of testing apply to RPG playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331966/#Comment_331966" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T17:00:22+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  5:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2011 5:01PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>A lot of things about appropriate testing strategies are going to change based on what the limiting factors are (e.g. time, people, data analysis, etc.), so I'm still trying to decide whether some of the beliefs I have from another type of testing apply to RPG playtesting.</blockquote>\nI think regardless of how you build your scenarios, what John says about focus is still important to keep in mind in the sense that you want <i>what you are looking for</i> to be focused, even if your scenarios are built to keep some of that broader, subtle interaction between elements that you identify. The point about trying to review dozens of hours of unstructured audio/video seems crucial to me, but maybe that's because I am used to 60 to 90 minute sessions maximum, for anything, and even then after reviewing 5-8 users going through the exact same things my eyes tend to glaze over. A structure for your analysis is important, and focused scenarios are one good way to achieve that.<br><br>At the same time, the ideal for any scenario is that the tasks involved, while discrete to the observer/test designer, appear to the user to be part of a continuous, natural process. In other words, the closer to "just playing the game" the scenarios feel like, the more likely you are going to get genuine results; artificial-feeling scenarios will produce artificial behaviour, <i>especially</i> in such an analytic-minded population as RPG players. <br><br>John touched on this above: the goal is not to get opinions, and conscious analysis of the game for its own sake, rather than for the sake of continuing play, <i>is an opinion</i>. The more aware the user is that they are in a test the more likely they are going to begin consciously testing the game, and while that is a useful thing to have people do, it's not usability testing. Given that many roleplayers -- especially the kind who are likely to volunteer for this sort of activity -- tend to analyse a game as they play it anyways, it's not really possible (or desireable) to limit this sort of thinking completely, but you want it to come up as part of <i>playing</i> the game.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331977/#Comment_331977" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T18:14:21+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  6:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2011 6:19PM by jenskot.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>A lot of things about appropriate testing strategies are going to change based on what the limiting factors are (e.g. time, people, data analysis, etc.), so I'm still trying to decide whether some of the beliefs I have from another type of testing apply to RPG playtesting.</blockquote>\nI suspect you might run into some conflicts. Not just Usability Testing for RPGs but for websites and other simple applications. Usually time, budgets, and experienced staff are highly constrained to the point that you have to take certain liberties or risk not testing at all. I've worked on projects where we've had million dollar budgets but more often than not budgets are thousands of dollars or less. For RPGs, you are probably talking hundreds of dollars or less. Usability Testing techniques have evolved to be as lean as possible while giving you the most bang for your limited time. <br><br>With most Usability Testing, your sample sizes are going to be tiny and too small to draw large definitive conclusions. But these techniques are reliable for quickly identifying core problems. Often the root causes won't be identified 100% accurately but just enough to make changes and test again in a quick and cheap manner. <br><br>If it\u2019s unclear which fixes will work best we usually perform A/B or Multivariate testing. For those who don't know, with A/B testing, you distribute different versions of a test (including a control test) with a single variable changed to see which change moves you closer to your goals. But for these specific tests to be effective, you need to reach a large enough audience that there is a reasonable chance of detecting meaningful differences between the distributed tests. Unfortunately difficult for a small game with a limited audience but very useful for websites. Even still, you probably won't be able to 100% accurately identify root causes but can learn enough to make positive changes.<br><br>That all said, I suspect some of your experience still applies.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332055/#Comment_332055" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T09:31:43+00:00" title="June 28, 2011  9:31AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Running Usability Tests</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBy now you:<br/>\n&gt; know your game's goal<br/>\n&gt; know your audience<br/>\n&gt; know what you want to test<br/>\n&gt; have a scenario that encompasses the tasks you want to test<br/>\n&gt; recruited at least 3 uninitiated testers or groups of testers<br/>\n<br/>\nNext step is running your testers through your scenarios! This is where you will find the 5 biggest differences between Usability Testing and Playtesting:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You will monitor the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally live in person or via skype (or the equivalent of skype) but if you have to via recordings. But to really get the most out of Usability Testing, I highly stress being able to monitor and interact live with your testers.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You will record the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecord all your tests, even when you are present for the test. In the moment you may miss something and there are times where it is crucial to have your observations double checked by a third party. A recording will make this possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. You won't ask your tester's opinions after the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften in playtesting, people play and then write up a report. There are major problems with this situation that I can go into later if desired.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problem is that people are unreliable self-reporters. Their job is to playtest, not observe themselves playtesting. To complicate things even further, the majority of the feedback people write isn't in real time. Instead after the session they try to remember back and piece together what happened. This produces unreliable results. And finally, the reports playtesters create take them a lot of time to put together so if you aren't going to be able to use them, why waste their time? Your goal is to make observations by studying what people do, not what they say they did. In Usability Testing, actions speak louder than words! Which brings us back to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> above\u2026 you will need to monitor the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. You will run your testers through the test but you won't directly participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won't play in the game and you won't run the game. Instead you will give your testers what they need to run the game themselves. You won't show them how, you won't explain the rules, you won't answer rule questions, you will simply observe and guide them through the test.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. You will guide your testers.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though you won't be running the game, it is still important to guide the test itself. This means keeping the testers focused, setting their expectations, running them through "talking out loud" exercises, and recording the results.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Preparing Yourself</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the test, do you best to\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Be professional and as neutral as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don't joke, be sarcastic, flirt, or distract.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Try to make you presence as small as possible in relationship to your testers. Sit away from them. Sit lower than them. When you take notes, do so in a way that is out of their eyesight.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Spend more time listening than talking. Whenever you talk, your goal is to say the minimum needed to get your testers to do most of the talking.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When you are selecting and interacting with testers before the test itself, study how they respond to your questions. What gets them talking? What confuses them? What tendencies do they exhibit? What makes them confortable?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don't bias the testers. Don't express your own opinions of either the testers or the test itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Keep the focus on the testers. Avoid "I" statements or long explanations. Talk as little as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don't let yourself get impatient!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When testers have a problem, they can often solve it themselves. Don't just in with answers. Part of your goal is to see what problems they find, how they work around them, how long it takes, how frustrating it is, and how it impacts the rest of the test. Only help when they have hit a complete roadblock and can't continue with the test. Even them, count to 20 silently first and then involve yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Doesn\u2019t influence your testers actions. Don\u2019t ask leading questions or make leading statements. If you want to test "how long does this task take", in your scenario, don\u2019t say "character creation is super fast". Don\u2019t influence!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don't lead your testers with the answers you want. For example, statements like "that was easy, wasn't it?" That's an obvious example, but more subtle examples include "was it easy to find what you were looking for" and "was that a problem?"<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Ask neutral questions. Frame your questions as neutral as possible. For example, "how was doing that task for you", "what do you think of this page", or "I noticed when you were doing [X], [Y] happened, what was going on there, how did you feel about it?"<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Never blame the testers! Don't insinuate that testers are stupid or did something wrong. Avoid questions that suggest the tester should have done something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Run through your scenario before you give it to a tester. Make sure it\u2019s clear and error free, otherwise you tests may fail for reasons unrelated to your game. Check your grammar, make sure any jargon is clearly defined, give clarifying examples, and cut out anything that isn\u2019t related to your test that could distract from your goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What's next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nPreparing Your Testers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332062/#Comment_332062" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T10:13:35+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 10:13AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Preparing Your Testers</b><br/>\n<br/>\nExplain the following to your testers\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You will be recording the session. Get all necessary approvals (I recommend having testers sign consent forms).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Describe the scenario or task at hand but not the steps required to complete it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Tell them that you are testing the instructions, not them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If they have any difficulties, it isn't their fault but problems with the design.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They can stop the task at any time if they become uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They may ask questions at any time but there are questions you may not answer, like how to solve problems they may encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You will not tell them when they have completed the task, they must determine this on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You would like them to think aloud as they are run through the scenario. Say what you are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling as you go about each task. You can explain that part of the reason is to make it clear for those later listening to the audio recording. Reassure them that this is a safe space, they can say anything, just be honest. Make sure they know that they aren\u2019t being judged.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If the tester seems uncomfortable with the concept of thinking aloud, you can explain how sometimes it takes a little getting used to and we can run through a few practice examples first before the official scenario begins. You can ask them to read a simple document first and pause to explain what they are thinking and feeling as they are reading. Preferably use a neutral document unrelated to your scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Since RPG tests can involve multiple participants, it easy to get off track as testers comment on each other's thoughts. In general, you would like everyone to stay focused on the tasks at hand instead of commenting on other tester's thoughts. You may at times interrupt and re-focus the conversation on the scenario. It's common in RPGs to have a lot of table talk and tangents but for the purposes of the test, you would like everyone to focus as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know this will sound funny\u2026 but it\u2019s probably best not to tell them you\u2019re the game designer! That alone will bias the test. Probably tough to do for most RPGs, but if you can, get a partner or a neutral party to run the tests. Involve the designer as little as possible. Or make as little references to being the designer as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Running Tests</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally your scenarios are prepared so testers can run through them without your involvement. Your goal is to observe and not interfere. To take note of what the testers do without trying to interpret their actions or words. If your rules are in the pre-alpha state (more ideas than solid procedures), feel free to guide the testers through your scenarios but recruit a third party to observe the test or absolutely make sure to record the test so you can make observations later. Don\u2019t multitask.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the hardest part of running tests is keeping everyone thinking aloud. Here are a few techniques you can use\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Repeat their words back to them as a question, "that message is confusing?" Echo their words to set up and reinforce social expectations. They say something, you repeat it, then they say the next thing because that is what is expected. Do it enough times where it becomes a ritual. Be patient, it takes a few times before it sinks in.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don't put words in their mouths or offer interpretations. Doing so makes them feel that they don't have to explain further, you create an expectation that you will do the thinking for them, and even worse\u2026 often you will be misinterpreting!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Your goal is to listen more than speak but that makes some people feel uncomfortable. Signaling that you are still listening and it is ok to keep talking helps lessen uncomfortable feelings. But try not to signal with words if possible. Nod your head, say "mmm" or "hmmm" to signal you are fully engaged and expect them to keep talking if they have more to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When we ask questions, we often end our statements in an upswing. It's partially why sentences that end in vowels sometimes sound like questions when they aren't. Let your statements tail off and end in an upswing to signal to the tester to complete your statement. "And you were expecting\u2026?" "And your goal is\u2026?"<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Speak softly.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Focus on questions, not answers. Focus on tasks, not goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don\u2019t be too quick to assume that the tester is lost or having a problem. Some people take longer than others. Be patient. Give testers time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If they do seem lost, prompt them for feedback in a neutral way. "What are you thinking you should do here?"<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don't allow your emphasis, vocal tones, body language, or facial expressions to betray your own interests or bias. It is natural for some testers to look for approval, stay neutral. Testers can easily read between the lines so be mindful of all your communication, not just verbal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Use questions to prompt testers to think aloud:<br/>\n- What is your goal?<br/>\n- What did you expect when you did that?<br/>\n- How did you expect that to work?<br/>\n- Can you tell me what you were thinking?<br/>\n- What do you want to accomplish here?<br/>\n- Describe the steps you are going through here.<br/>\n- How did you feel about that process?<br/>\n- Tell me about your thinking here.<br/>\n- What did you expect to happen when you . . . .?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When the test reveals something new that is key to understanding your design, briefly summarize the event and the thinking the tester expressed, then pause to allow the tester time to add more details or express any unspoken thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Keep the recorder on after the scenario is finished. Testers will often make useful statements after the pressure of the scenario is off or sometimes it just takes extra time for certain thoughts to formulate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What's Next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTaking Notes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332070/#Comment_332070" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T10:57:04+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 10:57AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Taking Notes</b><br/>\n<br/>\nYou won't have to take too many notes during the scenario. By having testers think aloud and repeating their findings, your recording will capture most of what you need to write notes later. Another reason to keep scenarios and recordings short!<br/>\n<br/>\nUse notes during the scenario to:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Write down anything you don't think your recording will clearly capture.<br/>\n&gt; Self-reminders if you think of a question you want to ask later.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of your note taking will happen after the scenario. Once you've had a chance to review your recording, take notes on the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Scenario tasks<br/>\n&gt; Scenario goals<br/>\n&gt; Scenario time and date<br/>\n&gt; Tester name<br/>\n<br/>\nFor each task:<br/>\n&gt; How long it took to learn<br/>\n&gt; How long it took to perform<br/>\n&gt; How easy was it to remember<br/>\n&gt; What was the tester feeling when performing these tasks<br/>\n&gt; What errors occurred<br/>\n&gt; Was the tester able to recover from these errors<br/>\n&gt; How long did it take to recover from these errors<br/>\n&gt; How did they recover from these errors<br/>\n&gt; What did the tester think of these tasks<br/>\n&gt; What time in the recording did the above occur<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Identify Problems</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI like to wait till I've completed a scenario with 3 groups of testers before moving on to the next steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nReview your notes and identify all of the problems (even if you don't think they are actual problems).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can, get a second person to create a report by reviewing the recordings and identifying the problems independently of your observations. Compare the two reports.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake special note of any problems or unusual behavior that happen more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare these problems to your game's goals. Decide which problems need to be solved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Fixing Problems</b><br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is time to put Usability Testing aside and go back to design!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've identified the problems you want to solve that are important to your game's goals, possibly have a few hints at what caused them, and are ready to move forward. Since this thread isn't about design, I won't go into too much detail here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I highly recommend keeping a record of the changes you make. When you make a change to your design, save an older version of the design and date it. It is also helpful to keep notes on what has changed and why. Especially why. Always go back to your game's goals when deciding how to prioritize your time. It will help keep you focused.<br/>\n<br/>\nVersioning is also important because you may find that your fixes create new problems or aren't the solutions you need. Sometimes you will need to go back to an older design. Versioning also means you can keep your documents clean and delete any unneeded text knowing you safely have a backup.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe merciless when fixing problems. Kill your sacred cows! What do you have to lose? You can always go back. What do you have to gain? Everything! So be relentless! Be bold!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Confirming Solutions</b><br/>\n<br/>\nNow that you have your fixes, it is time to confirm they actually solve your problems and don't create new problems. How do you confirm? Back to Usability Testing!<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate new scenarios to test your new solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun these scenarios with new, uninitiated testers. Don't use the testers who found the problems you are trying to solve. If you absolutely have to, you can reuse these testers on future scenarios but keep them away from the scenarios that try to fix the problems they experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's the basics of Usability Testing! Keep iterating through this process till your design has met your goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even though that's the end of Usability Testing basics, we're not done yet!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What's Next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTesting your text is more important than testing your rules!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332071/#Comment_332071" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T11:10:36+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 11:10AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Testing your text is more important than testing your rules!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone buys your game\u2026 all your rules become guidelines (even when they aren't guidelines) to be followed or discarded at the whim of your audience. Sometimes knowingly, sometimes accidentally.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even if they decide to follow your guidelines, the rules don\u2019t matter unless they understand what the rules are, how to use them, why they are important, when to use them, what will happen if you don\u2019t use them\u2026 and then actually remember all this when it is time to play!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where your game text comes in and why testing text is more important than testing rules. Your rules have no power at anyone\u2019s gaming table. You must persuade players to use them (this is true even in boardgames). Your text is your only tool of persuasion. Use it wisely!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour text needs to do more than teach. Your text needs to turn its advocates into teachers to spread its message. Your text has to arm its readers with the tools to teach other people who will never bother to read your text! This is where handouts, character sheets, and reference sheets all come in. They not only help people who haven\u2019t read the rules to learn\u2026 but also remind everyone what the rules are, when, and how to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>I don\u2019t know how to write my rules\u2026</b><br/>\n<br/>\nBut you probably know how to verbally teach others how to play them. So do that and record yourself. Then listen to the recording and create an outline. What order did you explain things? What questions did people ask? What rules needed extra explanation? What examples really helped people understand how to play? What confused people?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then do it again but this time, as scary as it might sound, video tape yourself doing it! Why? Because when you\u2019re teaching people how to play, you\u2019re probably using body language and visual cues (pointing to specific rule pages, charts, character sheets, rolling dice) to help people understand what you\u2019re talking about. And your text can do the same thing with the help of images.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend having someone who doesn't know how to play your game with you when you make these recordings. Have them interrupt you every time they don\u2019t understand something you've said (I know that sounds annoying). If you ask them to make a choice whose consequences they don't understand because you've left out relevant information, encourage them to speak up. This is all vital to know when writing your rules text.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just did this for 2 boardgame designers and the results were exactly what we needed. It's amazing how much clarity and enthusiasm we lose when writing rules text that we naturally have when explaining the rules in person. It helps you zero in on what is important and what is a distraction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>And hire an editor!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nEditing isn\u2019t just fixing grammar and spelling mistakes!<br/>\n<br/>\nEditing is also about content. What\u2019s the best way to express an idea? What order is the clearest and most effective way to express your ideas? Which ideas need to be reinforced with examples? Which ideas aren\u2019t important and need to be cut out?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Editing is not enough! </b><br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to test your editing just like you would test any rule changes. Grab someone and watch them read your rules out loud. If its\u2019 painful, don\u2019t turn away\u2026 find out why it hurts and fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>If I do all this, will my game sell?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDoes a contract protect your rights? Not absolutely. My friend Chris who\u2019s an IP lawyer once described contracts as a +2 circumstance bonus in a d20 law roll. Nothing is guaranteed but just like in D&amp;D; when you\u2019re facing a red dragon, you\u2019re going to want every bonus you can get! You might attack unprepared and get lucky rolling a natural 20! Or watch in despair when that die reveals that cruel critical miss\u2026 a natural 1! But the game isn\u2019t about just 1 roll. It\u2019s about trying again and again. Learning from mistakes. And arming yourself as best you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>I hope that helps!</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIt all sounds harder than it actually is. And even if you can only do 25% of the above\u2026 you\u2019re ahead of most game designers! Hell, if you just clearly know what problem your game solves and who your audience is\u2026 that alone puts you way ahead. Focus on doing what you can. Be honest with yourself. Remember that getting started is the hardest part. And doing the first 10% is the first step in doing the next 10%.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What's Next?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nShould your testers try to break your rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332081/#Comment_332081" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-28T11:54:13+00:00" title="June 28, 2011 11:54AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2011 12:20PM by jenskot.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Should testers try to break your rules? </b><br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on your goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is important to run your game through a stress test. Set up a scenario where the task at hand is breaking your game. Recruit people who enjoy breaking games, unlocking unbalanced winning combos, or discovering optimization min maxing techniques that once found\u2026 why choose anything else? All useful!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this can be a problem if you aren't running a stress test. Sometimes when people focus on breaking games, they are ignoring other parts of the game (possibly the parts that you are currently testing). Or they are allowing preconceptions and agendas to bias the test. All of these can be problems in Usability Testing but it is even a bigger problem in RPGs. Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause often in RPGs your test involves multiple testers. 1 person with a preconceived agenda of breaking your game can end up biasing the rest of the testers. Additionally, since RPGs are social activities, this behavior may negatively impact the other players who don't share this agenda and throw the entire test off and end up wasting everyone's time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen this happen frequently. Because this is a common occurrence, when preparing your testers you should be clear what you expect from them. If you don't want them to try to break the game, tell them. It is possible they may be disappointed. Some people love breaking games. You can assuage some of that disappointment by telling them you will run future stress tests where the goal will be to break the game. Depending on how today goes, you might invite them back for those tests. This can also be dangerous because they may then try to play nice during your scenario. The goal isn't to play nice, it is to be honest. So be careful how you deal with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, during the test, don't blame the testers! It is possible that the impulse to try to break a mechanic wasn't an agenda the tester had coming in. Maybe something in your game is inspiring this urge? Ask questions, listen, try to find out what they are feeling and once the test begins, try to interfere as little as possible. If this becomes a pattern, something in your game may be inspiring this behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Game Designers as Testers</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSome game designers are always designing, even when they are testing. They may be thinking 3 steps ahead instead of focusing on the task at hand. Their natural problem solving abilities may have them looking for problems to fix before they've encountered any problems at all. If they designed a similar game (or designing one), there may be a conflict of interest that causes unforeseen problems. Or they could be a huge help, especially if they are part of your game's audience.

Now, while shyness is nice, it can definitely stop you dead in your tracks when you are looking for people to test with.  Truth be told, my social anxiety gets the better of me far too often, so I looked to my immediate circle of friends for help testing my game.  Interestingly, only one of these folks had any substantial RPG experience, and most had none at all!<br><br>Our first few sessions revolved around wringing out the game text so that someone who barely understands what we mean by RPG (let alone Story Game) could sit down, read the text, and get a feel for the game right away.  I did my undergrad work in Technical Writing, but I was amazed at how poorly my first draft really read.  It was hard for people to grasp, and, perhaps more importantly, it was somewhat unapproachable - it wasn't friendly at all!!!  After taking suggestions from my friends, I was able to revise revise revise and get to a point where the text was both informative and inviting.  However, none of this would have been possible without the usability edge.  Each question I asked discovered elements of the text that I would have otherwise glossed over.  In fact, when we did our first "character creation session," I learned more about the rules than I did the character creation process!<br><br>I guess the moral of this story is that by diversifying my player pool, understanding my audience (user) needs, and tailoring the text toward this aim really made the difference.  It really was that simple.  I mean, if I was writing a text in English for a French audience, it already makes no sense!  Likewise, writing a game text for a strictly story game audience (which was not my target audience) forced me to think about how I could invite new people into the world I had crafted and how I could ensure that they had fun!<br><br>~Klaus                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332565/#Comment_332565" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-30T15:50:47+00:00" title="June 30, 2011  3:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>A lot of things about appropriate testing strategies are going to change based on what the limiting factors are (e.g. time, people, data analysis, etc.), so I'm still trying to decide whether some of the beliefs I have from another type of testing apply to RPG playtesting.</blockquote>\nI suspect you might run into some conflicts. Not just Usability Testing for RPGs but for websites and other simple applications. Usually time, budgets, and experienced staff are highly constrained to the point that you have to take certain liberties or risk not testing at all. I've worked on projects where we've had million dollar budgets but more often than not budgets are thousands of dollars or less. For RPGs, you are probably talking hundreds of dollars or less. Usability Testing techniques have evolved to be as lean as possible while giving you the most bang for your limited time.<br>The point I was trying to make is that things like "most bang" and "limited time" have assumptions cooked into them, just like the default "best practices" that I recall from my testing experience. My most successful project in the microprocessor validation world was under a schedule crunch so we had to re-examine our base assumptions and we realized that they had been optimized for a set of limiting factors that were different from the limiting factors we were facing on that particular project. But I fear I'm getting too philosophical for your thread, since I tend to be approaching it from an "are these practices the best ROI for driving quality into your game?" POV rather than "are these practices the way you would use this type of testing in RPGs?".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Please feel free to ask questions</blockquote>\nDo you have more thoughts about how to apply these ideas to RPGs specifically?

Have you tried it?</blockquote>\nI've mostly applied Usability Testing to board and online games but I've Usability Tested a few RPGs. RPGs are a bit tough because I find the traditional 4+ hour session to be long for what needs to be done. I usually break down the session into 1 hour chunks and focus on testing very specific elements (character creation, word creation, specific mechanics). That said, some RPGs have interconnected reward cycles that require several mechanics to be played out to truly test them as they are codependent. In those cases, I make sure to test out the smaller parts first and then play a longer session with testers who have the basics of the game already down. But I will only go there once everything else is rock solid. Often playtests start off with the full game right away which can be problematic. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>Here's an interesting testing situation I just ran into.

As a moderator, I would have the GM take me aside and think aloud away from the players. In general, I also try to create scenarios that don't test GM tasks and player tasks at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
