Any and all comments and feedback would be most welcome.<br/><br/>!UNNATURAL DISASTER! Copy_Left 2012 by Snake_Eyes<br/><br/>CONCEPT<br/><br/>You play Immortals that create natural disasters to punish other faiths, and therefore increase loyalty with your own faith.<br/><br/>During play you narrate how you divinely intervene upon the faith of other players, through a natural disaster or warfare, to win the war between Gods.<br/><br/>SET UP<br/><br/>Each player starts with three of each kind of common (3d4, 3d6, 3d8, 3d10, 3d12, 3d20, 3d30) gaming dice, for a total pool of twenty-one dice. (Other dice may be substituted as long as each player has the same pool of dice, and it is preferable to be consisted of sets of three for determining the Victory Condition, but any combination of dice is possible without needing the restructuring of any of the rules.)<br/><br/>Each player will need a sheet of paper or two, (the blank side of this printed document would be ideal) and a pen.<br/><br/>BEFORE PLAY<br/><br/>The order of play (and seating order) is determined at the start of the game by whomever rolls the highest combined number of their twenty-one dice pool.<br/><br/>ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT<br/><br/>On your turn you may initiate a Challenge to any other single player. This is done by writing down your intended action, in simple language, or narrating your intention.<br/><br/>This represents a spiritual contest of a disaster or war. It can be anything from a biblical plague to modern unconventional biological or chemical warfare, even something such as a political uprising or act of religious extremism. That the action could range from a localised hate-crime against a church, the assassination of a pontiff, or a one of the military super-powers declares nuclear war to commit an act of genocide does dot bear any correlation to the effects of the outcome. A small act can have dramatic repercussions, and likewise a significant event may only have a moderate effect on the faith of your believers.<br/><br/>PASSIVE ENGAGEMENT<br/><br/>If your faith is under the effects of a natural disaster you *may* bring any one other player into the resolution. This player must bid at least 3 dice, and participate in the resolution as normal.<br/><br/>You should simply narrate your intention in a clear language. Again you may take any reactive position that could fit within the narrative framework of the scene.<br/><br/>BETTING<br/><br/>Choose how many dice you want bet, each player can have different value bets of both amount and kind of dice.<br/><br/>The only conditions are that the minimum ante is three dice, and the maximum ante is two thirds of your remaining pool of dice, roll them against each other.<br/><br/>RESOLUTION<br/><br/>If you roll the maximum number possible on any of the dice, you must raise your bet pick an equal-sided lower-sided dice, or two higher-sided dice (if you have any dice left) from your pool for each dice that show the maximum result, and roll them as normal as part of the resolution.<br/><br/>If you roll a 1, your opponent gets to add those dice to his unused pool immediately, they are not counted towards your roll.<br/><br/>If you rolled any multiples of the same number the amount of dice showing the same number is called \u201cMagnitude\u201d where as the number on the dice is called \u201cStrength\u201d.<br/><br/>i.e. rolling 2,3,5,5,5,6,6,7 gives your choice of either a Magnitude 3 Strength 5 (by using the three 5s) or Magnitude 2 Strength 6 (by using the two 6s).<br/><br/>The highest Magnitude wins, and the Strength determines the dice you \u201cCapture\u201d.<br/><br/>If the Magnitude is tied, then Strength is the tie-breaker.<br/><br/>If both Magnitude and Strength are tied, then each player takes back any remaining dice they ante that did not roll a 1 (as these should not be in the ante at this stage).<br/><br/>CAPTURE<br/><br/>The winning player takes all of the participating opponents dice they bet with, that showed results of less than the Strength of success.<br/><br/>i.e. if you have won the Challenge with a Magnitude 2 Strength 5 result, you take all the losers dice that rolled 4 or less.<br/><br/>If you have two or less dice left in your pool at the end of a resolution you participated in, take one dice from each other player.<br/><br/>OUTCOME<br/><br/>Winning and the Capture of dice (or as the active player by simply having your action not suffer a Capture of your own dice as an outcome) also allows you to finish the narrative of the scene regardless of whom was the active player in the scene.<br/><br/>The narrative again is only bound by continuity, and staying within the agreed frame-work of the scene, using the actions of the participants.<br/><br/>VICTORY CONDITION<br/><br/>You may narrate the outcome of the session if you have more than two thirds of the total dice in the game (equal to fourteen dice times the number of players).<br/><br/>SUGGESTION FOR PLAY<br/><br/>By writing down your intended action, and the reaction of other players you can form a time-log of the course of your game story.<br/><br/>It is ideal that it is not left up to one player to assume to responsibility of writing down everyone's intentions and outcomes.<br/><br/>You should give a brief description of the persona of your character before play begins.<br/><br/>ADVANCED RULES<br/><br/>You may randomly give a characteristic to your persona from the following list of four or make up your own and have each player pick one blind before play:<br/><br/>Enyo, Goddess of Warfare: The minimum bid for any other player participating in a Challenge with you, that they must ante is four dice.<br/><br/>Eos, Personification of Dawn: At any time if you have no dice left after any action you may take two dice from each other player instead of only one.<br/><br/>Eris, Goddess of Discord and Strife: Once each game you may ask each player to hold a dice in there hand, you reveal one of your dice and if any player is holding a dice of the same kind you may take it and add it to your pool. You do not have to tell any other player what kind of dice you have left in your pool.<br/><br/>Tyche, Goddess of Fate: When you roll a 1 in a Challenge you may add one dice of any kind to the ante, if the dice you ante is higher you do not have to ante two as per the normal ruling.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance,<br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403135/#Comment_403135" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T22:38:30+00:00" title="January  8, 2013 10:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *necromancy*<br/><br/>/o\\ Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
