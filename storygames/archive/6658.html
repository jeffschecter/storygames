We played <i>Battlefield 2</i>, which is now an old game, because that's how we roll - by staying a few years behind the curve, we save a lot of money and heartache.  Anyway, some cool features of <i>Battlefield 2:</i><br/><br/>The Commander - one player can unplug from the FPS paradigm and oversee the battle with UAVs, dropping supplies and (most importantly) artillery.  You can chat up the commander and direct fire and supplies down on your position.  Utterly great.  <br/><br/>Squads - join a fire team, and instead of respawning after death at a fixed point in the rear, you respawn next to your squad leader.  This is brilliant - there's a direct incentive for teamwork and keeping your squad leader alive.  <br/><br/>Artillery - Basically death from a clear blue sky, utterly disorienting and terrifying and the closest thing I've seen in a game to what survivors of artillery barrages describe.  Very well done.  Every time it came down I wanted to find a hole to crawl in.<br/><br/>Kits - Yeah, you've got classes, and each class has a job that transcends being fighty.  Several support other players, two directly deny resources to the enemy, they are well balanced and all of them are engaging and fun.  Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Maps - Objectives are clear and absurdly well balanced.  Every map has interesting bits of color, like incidental ramps for the fast attack dune buggies, TOW positions anybody can use, and deformable terrain at key spots.  You can also blind and defang the enemy commander by taking out his UAV and radar facilities and artillery.  Blowing up bridges to channel enemy attacks is very satisfying.<br/><br/>Vehicles - Armor is pretty terrifying to infantry, again true to form.  APCs and those dune buggies trade off speed for vulnerability - you are a big target for ATGM gunners, who are plentiful, but you get there fast and pack a punch on the way.  Some maps have helos, which are amazingly bad-ass.  <br/><br/>So I'm basically delighted with the game and it totally delivers for me and my friends in a LAN setting.  The big take-away for me for tabletop design is the idea of disparate roles - why not have a Commander?  Why not provide concrete benefits for specific modes of teamwork, or for privileging a particular character?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147560/#Comment_147560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T06:35:33+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  6:35AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 6:37AM by Bent.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas<br/><br/>I started playing this on the PS2 about a month ago, having never played any of the games in the series before. There's plenty to be said about the game, but one thing I've liked is how the main story remains engaging despite its ridiculous length. (broad spoilers follow) You start out as a fellow returning home to an LA surrogate riddled with gang warfare. You decide to stick around and help rebuild your brother's gang, going from being distrusted and relegated to shit jobs, to eventually working your way up to being your brother's right hand man and initiating turf wars with rival gangs. There's even a 'respect' stat that the higher it gets, the more NPC gang members you can recruit to help you in turf wars.<br/><br/>This is interesting in and of itself but eventually a big twist in the story occurs and you end up in hiding/exile and whatever gains your gang made are wiped out. A new city on the big world map is unlocked and you have a new base of operations in a San Francisco analogue. On the one hand you're gangless and virtually on your own, but on the other, you're a more powerful criminal and you're acquiring property to keep trying to move up the underworld social ladder, networking with different people with different interests.<br/><br/>And that's where I am in the game. There's still a whole other city to be unlocked for me and I have no idea when that'll happen or what's in store. That's pretty awesome.<br/><br/>Aaaaanyhow, the thing that's interesting is how the game deals with its own massiveness and keeping gameplay fresh throughout. The same thread of stealing cars, enjoying the sandbox and playing gravy side missions is always there, but the main story arc carries you through to different tiers. Ever since I was kid playing DnD the rules about keeps and followers and henchmen intrigued me but rarely came up in play effectively. I'd like to see games with long-term play in mind codify different life-stages.<br/><br/>To use DnD as an obvious example, the way it's set up in 3.5 is that you're pretty much playing the same game whether you're level 1 or level 20. It'd be cool if, say, when you reach level 6, the game starts to change. You get land and/or followers and some income. The rules change so that you can get your followers to complete tasks for you on a macro level while you're still doing your thing with your party. The followers will have needs you'll have to meet as part of maintaining them, growing them and gaining more. Then when you hit level 14 or so, the game changes again. You're a Count, or a master druid, or head of the Thieves Guild and you've got a shitload of followers and land and your people do almost as much to accomplish your goals as you do directly. Their successes net you experience points.<br/><br/>I'd just like to see a game that recognises and pounces on these big shifts in characters' lives as they grow up and their fortunes change. In a more abstract and major way, I think Spore is another example of a video game that does this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147566/#Comment_147566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T06:58:22+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  6:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grand Theft Auto IV<br/><br/>Even NPR gave this game positively orgasmic reviews, and I can see why.  The main character is Niko Bellic, recent immigrant from an unnamed Eastern European country (Serbia is a good guess.)  Gameplay is smooth, keeping the look and feel of the GTA 3 family (3, Vice City, San Andreas) but changing the nuts, bolts and controls to the same core as Gears of War.<br/><br/>I love the depth of gameplay and story.  The story is intriguing, Niko comes to this country in part because he fell in with a bad crowd back home, but explains that he really didn't have a choice.  When he arrives here, he becomes involved with organized crime to save his cousin, and again, says that he has no choice.  There is some great dialogue and character development as Niko builds friendships and romances.  Building a friendship is more than playing through thier mission tree, you've also got to spend time with them.  If you're a good friend, they'll help you out, too.  Each friend and lover has different things they enjoy, and the system is fairly complex (keep doing the same thing or similar things and they'll get bored.)  But of course everyone enjoys going to see Katt Williams.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147569/#Comment_147569" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T07:06:08+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  7:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Turnip, so what can we learn from GTA4?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147709/#Comment_147709" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T13:40:59+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  1:40PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 1:41PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Animal Crossing - I find it kinda calming, except for the looming debt.

I think there's aspects of therapy in tabletop role play, but I'm unaware of any so typically low-key, soothing, but still quite enjoyable.

Okay, there's the design, but there's no goal oriented play there.  It's basically painting with pixels, and I don't see a way to make that into a roleplaying mechanic (although people were throwing around ideas that might work in the "drawing mechanic" thread from a few months ago, but my sense of that thread was "Yeah, there's not a real good way to incorporate this we can think of"). But you clearly enjoy the design aspect more than I do, so maybe you have an idea?<br/><br/>But beyond that, there's lots of conflict. I need bells to pay off my house (and get a bigger house). I need to plant and care for trees and flowers and remove weeds - either to raise fruit (for bells or asthetics) or to get a good environment score (for the golden watering can) or to breed rare flowers. There's trying to catch all the fish. Trying to catch all the bugs. My personal favorite of finding all the fossils. There's getting matching furniture, either matching sets or just personal taste, and to decorate your increasing number of rooms. There's matching sets of 'oids to collect. Rare clothes, wall papers, and carpets to get. Another favorite of mine, collecting pictures of your neighbors (by befriending them, which means being nice, sending them letters, and not upsetting them) - which is interesting because, it's the opposite tact of conflict in most games; instead of being an agent of strife and violence, you need to avoid strife and violence (which exists, but is nothing more than hitting them on the head with a bug catching net, and gains you nothing by doing it, unlike the majority of games).  And, well, a bunch of other things. It all amounts pretty much to collecting certains things, which you can cherry pick from among the options.  <br/><br/>I could see a RPG that's about collecting the right things, maybe it's called "Keeping Up With the Jones'", where a player's game power is determined by the amount of cool things one has.  "Cool" might be defined by matching styles, value, rarity, or even a measure of austerity (to mitigate a materialistic message) that influence the PCs personal stories. But you still have conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148138/#Comment_148138" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T14:06:41+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  2:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, one idea that we have where I work is called the "gameplay onion." It's something that could be applied to tabletop rpgs.<br/><br/>Basically, it forces you to list out what the gameplay is over different time scales. Second-to-second gameplay, minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and beginning-to-end. Some games have additional scales that they list in their onions that are particular to their own design. The general rule is that the smaller time scales at the core of the onion need to be fun in order to expose the fun in the larger scales (because otherwise the player gets bored/frustrated and stops playing).<br/><br/>It would be interesting to see a tabletop rpg try to take on the problem of keeping all the players engaged in an activity (that is, not kibitzing, unless kibitzing was somehow mechanically significant) on a second-to-second level. On the larger end of the scale, Burning Empires' infection mechanics are a good example of mechanically drawing fun out of the sum of smaller scale sessions/maneuvers/scenes/actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148205/#Comment_148205" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T17:36:25+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin, I don't really do any of that, but I still enjoy the game.<br/>\nIn the gamecube version, you don't have to water anything.<br/>\nI think you COULD approach it trying to "win", but I'm not sure you HAVE to?<br/>\nI could've been happy with a smaller house.<br/>\nFor there to be conflict, there has to be resistance.<br/>\nI just don't see a whole lot of that resistance.<br/>\nYes, the museum needs artwork, but they're not really bugging me.<br/>\nIf they started sending me letters, maybe it would force a direct action<br/>\nIt's not a difficult chore to dig a hole, or pick up seashells.<br/>\nI coulda been very happy just selling seashells and living in a shack.  <br/>\nIt just would've taken a bit longer to buy a fishing pole.<br/>\nThere's a bunch of things I wish it would do, but it is what it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148294/#Comment_148294" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T04:37:46+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  4:37AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite>the "gameplay onion."</blockquote>\nThat is really interesting, and it's easy to see how that is a useful tool for keeping video game development from getting off in the weeds.
