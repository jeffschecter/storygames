One thing, which is a bit hazy for me yet is Playing to find out what happens, and the MCs role in the whole process. <br/>This is how I see it now - it would be very helpful if someone with more experience with the game could comment on this:<br/><br/>As a preparation the MC dreams up some apocalyptic imagery, but doesn't commit to any storyline yet, and especially, doesn't create threats. That's fine, I suppose such images may come handy, when the characters visit new places/people in the world or some creative input is needed (i.e. a character gives a vague answer to a question, the MC may offer some specifics). The role of this kind of preparation is not to come up with threats the MC could pull out of her ass when the game loses momentum. MC moves must always be based on already established fiction ("Make your move but misdirect")<br/><br/>During the first session we follow through the characters on an "average" day and the MC asks questions like crazy. As I see the aim of this mechanic is to get the players invested in the world itself, and basically letting them arrange their own doom, and finding weak spots. All the MC does with the input provided by the player is:<br/>- Barfing apocalyptica on it. (making it rotten, decaying, unstable, desparate)<br/>- Making it real/making it move (integrating it in the world, letting it affect PCs and NPCs, making it act/progress based on already established fiction, etc.)<br/><br/>As I see, the MC herself rarely comes up with brand new details of the world, which wouldn't be already established by the players themselves. The whole mindset of the game seems to be that the players <i>are</i> the characters, so <i>they</i> know what the world looks like, and the MC has all the rights to ask them about it. So it's the players, who provide the building blocks for the world, the MC only provides color, and keeps the things on the table in motion in interesting ways. <br/><br/>Places, and even NPCs seem to be emergent things in Apocalypse World. Their existence is being established on demand by the players' answers. The MC may come up with drives for the NPCs and details for the places, the existence of which is already established, but generally speaking she doesn't "inject" stuff into the fiction which is not already established somehow. I guess this all comes down to the "Yes, and..."/"Yes, but..." rule of improvisation. The MC asks questions, the player establishes fiction, the MC uses it to make moves. <br/><br/>Is this the way its supposed to work, or am I on a wrong track?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466662/#Comment_466662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T14:25:50+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  2:25PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, the MC is just as valid a source of detail as the players. Yes, you should absolutely engage the players by asking questions like crazy, but the MC is a player in the game as well and can and should suggest ideas/details (from their own apocalyptica, etc).<br/><br/>Further, I've found in A* games that the strongest lever the MC has is in the form of Threats and NPCs. You're aware of stuff that the players are not and can introduce those details (Announce Future Badness) into your descriptions/roll resolutions. You're aware of NPCs goals and actions and I feel like those are the parts the MC has the most direct control over. Which is as it should be.<br/><br/>Of course, you're not supposed to be in love with those characters. As MC, you're the biggest fan of the PCs, and as such you're to look at everything (threats, resources, badness in the background) through the crosshairs. "Play to Find Out" means having no investment in the status quo. Everything can break. Anyone can die. And thus, you have no "plotline" to break. Just forces and people with desires and goals that produce story when they intersect with the player character's desires and goal.<br/><br/>That's my $0.02, anyway. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novbert" title="Novbert"><img alt="Novbert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novbert">Novbert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466674/#Comment_466674" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T19:13:05+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  7:13PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2017 7:13PM by Novbert.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            peccable: Okay, let me put it that way: Based on what you say, the MC may come up with an entire section of the world before the first session, full of NPCs, NPC relationships, power structures, insane cult leaders and whatnot, and still "Play to find out what happens" (Dogs in the Vineyard style).

There was an entire age of rpg design (in the late '80s and throughout the '90s) that attempted to basically ignore this difference, but most people seem to generally acknowledge that it doesn't quite work: the GM is a flawed human being who is ultimately influenced by their own prep, and this influence may at times have negative influence on their play.<br/><br/>The specific concern that Vincent probably has in AW is that a GM who preps will generally also create preconceptions and personal bias regarding the material they prep. GMs in certain styles specifically train to avoid preconceptions, but even if you're committed to "playing to find out what happens", you'll still be inescapably entrapped by subtle biases such as wanting to present your material and not wanting your material to be ignored: if you've prepped it, you want to present it, and you want the other players to acknowledge its validity, and you'll have difficulty seeing how the same material can be repurposed and reinterpreted in creative ways, because you're already stuck with your own interpretation of it. There are all sorts of biases you can have in this regard, and they're all conquerable in isolation, but it is quite difficult to be hygienic about them all, all the time. (Some games that require both extensive prior prep and absolute hygienic commitment to unbiased play make quite a big deal about this sort of thing.)<br/><br/>My personal answer to your question is that games similar to AW generally encourage the GM to prep in carefully constrained ways that specifically discourage them from creating poisonous preconceptions, such as pre-designed plot arcs that entrap the players in the GM's plans. You've reviewed the way AW attempts to achieve the same thing, and we could rephrase that advice in various ways, but basically it boils down to creating your prep in a fractured manner, without committing yourself psychologically to anything, focusing on prepping useful content rather than sequential plans of presentation. Rather create an interesting NPC in advance, but don't decide whether they should be a friend or foe, and where they'll be encountered, or anything of the sort.<br/><br/>It should probably be noted that all this makes much more sense to people who've played traditional rpgs, against which the AW's way of prepping adventures contrasts. For all I know that entire part of the GMing advice in the book might be meaningless for you. AW is also not particularly frail in this part, and people usually have their own preferences about how specifically they GM things, so it's fine to experiment, I think. Make the game your own by doing things the way you think they should be done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466687/#Comment_466687" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T21:58:43+00:00" title="September 29, 2017  9:58PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Novbert" rel="nofollow">Novbert</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>peccable: Okay, let me put it that way: Based on what you say, the MC may come up with an entire section of the world before the first session, full of NPCs, NPC relationships, power structures, insane cult leaders and whatnot, and still "Play to find out what happens" (Dogs in the Vineyard style).

For example, if you planned a certain situation, plot, or landscape before you started the game, what happens when a player decides to be the Hardholder, and creates a whole settlement which is at odds with your own ideas? What if you had decided something about the nature of the apocalypse, but a player chooses to play the Quarantine, which will redefine that idea completely, session by session?<br/><br/>However, the idea of "playing to find out" is somewhat orthogonal to this approach to prep for the game: it's entirely possible to prep content as the MC and still play to find out (as others have pointed out).<br/><br/>I think that, in practice, each group finds its own balance of how much of the world-building falls on the MC and how much on the players. Your idea of having the players do most of it (guided by questions from the MC) is good, but it's not the only way. In a group with a very motivated MC and timid or uninspired players, more of the world-building prep falls quite naturally into the hands of the MC, and that's OK. So long as the MC limits herself to prepping locations, NPCs, details about the world and its past, and so forth, you can still "play to find out". Even some planning for the future is possible, so long as the MC maintains an iron discipline about all her ideas being entirely mutable based on the interests and decisions of the players. (For example, she might prep an attack by a warlord on a holding... but should the players do something which changes the political landscape of the warlord's gang vis-a-vis the holding, she should be prepared to play the NPCs in the moment and select a more suitable or more interesting turn of events.)<br/><br/>Following the instructions for prep pretty much by the book will accomplish this well.<br/><br/>A basic principle is that the dramatic interests of the characters and their players determine the focus of play: perhaps the Gunlugger really cares about the safety of a certain little girl, for instance. In that case, your job as the MC is to make efforts to highlight (and perhaps compicate) that aspect of the story, even if it means ignoring some of your other prep.<br/><br/>In terms of the MC's role in prep and world-building in the first session, I'd recommend the point of view that the MC is an equal participant in the process, rather than a bystander. It's totally cool (and very welcome) for you to jump in with ideas and details ("there's a slaver cult just North of the settlement") so long as you remember to stick to details and ideas which interact dramatically and in interesting ways with the PCs. Ultimately, the "show" is about these characters. So long as you remember to keep your prep to things which make Apocalypse World "feel real" and "keep their lives interesting", you should be good. Seeing the world-building phase as just as much of "conversation" as the rest of play, with yourself as an equal participant (or, in reality, sometimes more and sometimes less than equal, as in any conversation) is the key here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466694/#Comment_466694" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T23:45:09+00:00" title="September 29, 2017 11:45PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Novbert" rel="nofollow">Novbert</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>peccable: Okay, let me put it that way: Based on what you say, the MC may come up with an entire section of the world before the first session, full of NPCs, NPC relationships, power structures, insane cult leaders and whatnot, and still "Play to find out what happens" (Dogs in the Vineyard style).

After the first session, though, you start to get an idea. This means that your prep is much more likely to be relevant to the "stars" of the hypothetical story. <br/><br/>In <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, we know to some extent what the characters are interested in before we even start playing, because the game lays out its premise, themes, and character expectations so clearly. In <i>Apocalypse World</i>, we have a slightly more open palette, so doing things in the way described in the book leads the group and the MC to much more naturally focus on the interests of the PCs/players.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
