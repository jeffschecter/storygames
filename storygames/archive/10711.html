There have been years with lots of good movies \u2014 and years with lots of bad movies, every year, since the start of movies. (In other news, people are convinced crimes in the US is getting worse every year -- even though it isn't: <a href="http://trueslant.com/ryansager/2009/10/15/crime-perception/" rel="nofollow">Crime &amp; Perception</a>.  But people see things that way all the time.)<br/><br/><br/>But I want to stay with the social thing:<br/><br/>The problem isn\u2019t lots of people. Shakespeare was a producer and company member for his plays. He knew what actors he had available and wrote to give them parts to suit them best. Same with Moliere. And so on.<br/><br/>Theater. Movies. Bands. Studios run by name painters and helped by lots of assistants. Novelists working with editors.  Broadway shows are shaped on the road by the writer, director and the on-the-spot talent of the actors.<br/><br/>The trick is, is everyone at the top of their game and is everyone watching everyone else\u2019s back in different capacities.  The issue is, who has gathered socially to make the movie?<br/><br/>Shane Acker is an animator, not a writer. Like a lot of visually focused directors, he can let his love of the visuals run the movie \u2014 even if it means the script is lacking. Terry Giliam, Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov are examples of directors who do this. With a strong producer overseeing the show there will be a strong script, and no one is going to think that the visuals will carry the day.<br/><br/>So, let\u2019s see who was producing for Shane Acker:<br/><br/>Timur Bekmambetov and Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah. That\u2019s going to be a problem.  The problem isn't that there were too many people. It's that there wasn't anyone at the wheel who really knows his shit about shaping story.<br/><br/>The myth that art is done by one cool guy is pernicious, but I find it strange promulgated by folks who love the artistic expression of RPGs. <br/><br/>Some work is done by lone creator. But not all of it. And there's no correlations by work created socially and quality as far as I've ever been able to tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237761/#Comment_237761" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T15:08:44+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  3:08PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even the novel, that much vaunted fortress of the single visionary pursuing the deathless truth of their immaculate prose, is often less a solitary pursuit than you might think.

More people should go see movies as a group, then play it as an rpg after, either instead of, or in addition to, the normal chit-chat.<br/><br/>Also, when people say "art by committee" I think they usually mean assembly line: producer hires writer, director, editor, but those three don't speak to each other or know what the others are doing at all, so the end product is a mess. It's a disconnect between the person responsible for the completion of the final product, and the people actually doing the creative work. Anyway, that's usually what I see when people make that specific complaint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237775/#Comment_237775" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-15T17:25:19+00:00" title="October 15, 2009  5:25PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I commented in Joel's thread, I think "art by committee" means less "art made by a group," than the <em>system</em> that group plays under. "Committees" play with a system that calls for them to find the faults in each idea. So, you break down the energy in the room. You find the lowest common denominator.

I think it's important to point out that Judd's post and my post and Mick's post are not the same, and the many awesome things that Judd says are not equivalent to the many awesome things that Mick says are not equivalent to the (awesome, one hopes) things that I say. Mine was the original seed, but Mick expanded on that at somewhat of a right angle and Judd took off in that new direction full tilt.<br/><br/>But the common thread is indeed that we're passionate about story-making as a human activity! So there you go.<br/><br/>Graham, it may (or may not) be helpful to know that I'm speaking of "integrity" and such in terms of a story "ringing true" or being <i>true to itself.</i> I avoided using the word "truth," though, because Capital-T-Truth is, I believe, a phantasmal pursuit philosophically and often a detrimental priority to art. But in any case I <i>certainly</i> wasn't using "integrity" the way, say, politicians and televangelists use it--as a moral imperative and a label for people.<br/><br/>And everyone: I can't stress enough that I'm NOT down on collaboration. At all. Not one teeny bit. When I talked about story by committee I was referring to a particular process that is, or so I posited, an impediment to expressing real human-ness. My blog post does, in fact, suggest an <i>alternate</i> collaboration process, to wit, <i>the kind we practice around here.</i> And Judd's post seems to me to be, similarly, pointing to a way of collaborating that promotes life in stories, as contrasted with another process that stifles it. But it's all collaboration, right?<br/><br/>Also, I think that we'll go far in this conversation if we stick to telling our own stories. For instance, Christipher's offered some strong dissent toward my ideas, which seems to stem in part from my first relating my experience but then expanding that experience to make bold claims that overlap <i>his</i> experience from the <i>inside</i> of the Hollywood creative process. So recognizing that, I want to scale back to say that this isn't about all movies, now or ever, or about everyone's experience with movies, but rather, an experience that I had and reflected on. I also don't want to bite the hand that feeds me--I HAVE been nourished by many, many movies that came out of the Hollywood system, and I'm grateful for that.<br/><br/>And in the meantime, in addition to drinking from the wells of film and novels and comics, I have the power to <i>make stories myself, with my friends!</i> I can't <i>not</i> be passionate about that!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237801/#Comment_237801" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T00:25:19+00:00" title="October 16, 2009 12:25AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a while back in high school, my criteria for a "good movie" was a movie that left my head busy and eager to craft fiction.

Since then, though, I've seen plenty of busy-head-making movies that I thought were <i>shitty</i> movies.  In those cases, it's often been true that a great premise was so <i>poorly</i> explored that I just wanted to do it right myself.<br/><br/>Example: up through the scene where the rogue army guys blow away the hopelessly outgunned loyal army guys, I really thought The Rock was shaping up to be a fearless look at honesty and accountability between government and the military.  Oh well.<br/><br/>In a story-game RPG, I never know whether I'm going to wreck someone else's great premise or deftly address it, or whether they'll wreck my great premise or deftly address it.  I do think I can tell when a great premise comes together, though, and I think the majority of those games have turned out well.<br/><br/>Hope that was on-topic...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237814/#Comment_237814" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T03:05:52+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  3:05AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Barely on topic here, but I adored the movie 9.

Let me rephrase.<br/><br/>I agree one should focus on immediate choices, not planning ahead. But there are times when I do plan ahead: I think "Let's leave this guy alive, to make things interesting later" or "It looks like we're heading for a climax, let's work towards that".<br/><br/>How does that fit in with your not worrying about the story?

I think my \u2018default\u2019 stance is author stance, but I enjoy shading to actor stance and director stance, too.   I may drift into director stance too much\u2013being used to running games, <b>I sometimes devote more effort to thinking about the overall story and connections rather than concentrating on playing my character.</b>  I\u2019m going to be paying more attention to stance in the future, particularly my own, in an effort to see if there is a link between a particular stance and a particularly enjoyable gaming experience.   The excerpts in this episode are from Giants, Primetime Adventures, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

The first session is invariably over the top, totally gonzo, turned up to eleven.  It happens consistently - there's a warning about it in Universalis, for Pete's sake.<br/><br/>This strikes me as a place where maybe people are not worrying about the story, because they have their hands full with something new and there's no one to tell them to cool it.  Does that seems like a fair assessment?  <br/><br/>I guess I really like to keep an eye on "story" at the table, and make decisions that are informed by it occasionally.  I think the guys I play with are happy to break out in a meta discussion, maybe caution someone not to kill a guy who would be way more interesting later as an adversary, that sort of thing.

Don't follow a story structure, because it'll constrain you. Don't think that, in the next scene, you're going to murder someone, because everything might have changed by then. Just make interesting choices and see where the scene takes you.<br/><br/>However, it comes with a caveat, which is that an <i>awareness</i> of where the story is going is good. For example, it's good to have a sense that everything is building to a climax. Similarly, it's good to have a sense that, although this is a quiet scene, everything <i>seriously</i> needs to kick off in the next. None of that is set in stone, but a general awareness can be helpful.<br/><br/>Not the same thing you're saying, but related, I think.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237867/#Comment_237867" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T08:39:18+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  8:39AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Story </i>is definitely a tar pit.

But even so, more and more that is becoming a gut-reaction thing and not a think-five-steps-ahead thing.<br/><br/>Actual play example - All through the first session of Star Wars PTA that I played with Judd, Paul, Rich, and Daniel at GenCon 07, I was that jammed-up deer-in-headlights guy. It hindered my fun, it hindered everyone else's fun, and it made things less organic. I'm not being a martyr, it's a simple fact. These sessions are all recorded and released at Canon Puncture and it is right there for all to hear.<br/><br/>At the second SW-PTA session in 2008, I had more PTA experience, I understood more, and I was able to do what Judd is suggesting as the better alternative, and it made a million miles of difference. Things happened in '08 that were just outright incredible. Moments that I'll never forget, choices that drove us all deeper and deeper into the premise and surprised all of us. Glorious. Hell YES I'm passionate about this.<br/><br/>We did not get to play the next episode at GenCon 09 because most of us weren't there - but we hold out hope for next year and in the mean time I REFUSE to try to plan out what I might do, where things might go, and what would be the coolest story. You can't imagine how difficult that is for me because my very nature is to try to do what is best to craft a great, epic, perfect story. But no. I shall not do it. I will wait until we're at the table and I will allow the rules and our communal creative energy to set the course in the moment, in play. I have no idea what's going to happen. NONE of us does, and if my instincts about my pals are correct, we are all very happy with that state.<br/><br/>Do I think about what my character wants? Sure. Do I wonder about what I think the other characters want? Yep. Do I daydream about how the fiction might play out if this or that were to happen? Yes, but I try to limit that because it is simply too worthwhile to let this thing ride forward and let the story take care of itself.<br/><br/>Is it possible that because of this, we'll end up looking back after it is done and saying, "oh, if we'd done this it would've been more dramatic, or more mythic, or more story-like?" Sure. But you can do that until the cows come home - and to be honest, I think I've come to realize in spite of myself that even if you DO shepherd the fiction along in terms of what's good for the story, you might still end up with something less-than.<br/><br/>I also accept that your mileage might vary on this. As with most other things we discuss, it comes down to what works for you and your group. But for me, my play is much more enjoyable and much more meaningful now that I'm focused on making meaningful choices in the moment rather than worrying about what makes the best story. And the stories that emerge from the type of play I tend toward now - the type that Judd is talking about - are invariably very thematically rich stories - because I now believe that "story" is not this flimsy delicate thing that can be ruined or crushed if it isn't shepherded by a firm hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237877/#Comment_237877" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T09:10:55+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  9:10AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The goal is a night of people making meaningful choices at the table.

There's no need to refer to me in the third person. I'm right here, posting in the thread.<br/><br/>I'm a little perplexed by your conjecture about me. I don't feel like that's the most generous interpretation of my statements. Let me assure you that I'm not just roleplaying out of desperation, 'cuz I can't get it anywhere else. I love this form of storytelling deeply, and I think it alchemizes group creativity in a unique way. I was just expressing why the activity is <i>as</i> important as it is to me. In a world where all stories have integrity, I would be <i>slightly less</i> passionate about this form. It's urgency is just amplified by the state of mass media, is all.<br/><br/>It sounds like you agree with me about authentic stories being relatively rare out there in consumer-entertainment-land, so it's somewhat disconcerting to recieve this kind of criticism from you. Hiopefully I've cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about my message.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>It reminds me of an improvisation tenet, which is "Don't plan ahead".</blockquote>\nYes, Graham, exactly.

I had set up this great NPC (a charming, amoral bandit king named Bad Fang, who was inadvertently saved from the headman's block by the PCs and was travling with them under duress), with plans to have him bcome a recurring character. <br/><br/>But one of the players killed him. <br/><br/>The scene where this NPC got killed wasn't particularly dramatic or awesome, and the other players expressed varying degrees of the sentiment Jason is alluding to ("Way to kill the main, NPC, dude"). James, the player who'd done it, said afterwards that he wished he hadn't, and we should retcon the NPC back to life for the next game. <br/><br/>We let it be, however, and instead added "Bad Fang's Ghost" as a magical item in the possession of James' character (it lets him re-roll failed dice once per game, but also saps his endurance). Which turned out to be awesome, and everyone likes it, and James plays up his character's guilt over the murder and relationship to the ghost.<br/><br/>So ... there's an AP example of people looking out for "the story", but when we chose not to, a better and more organic story was created.<br/><br/>Note: This is not to disagree with Jason's, or anyone's, post, just an anecdote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239380/#Comment_239380" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T06:18:13+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  6:18AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To whom it may concern: <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/reinventing-us/" rel="nofollow">I'm at it again, folks.</a> This time I'm exploring <i>what's so important about making our own stories, anyway?</i><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
