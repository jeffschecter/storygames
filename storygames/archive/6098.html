Most of the information was based on growing up there and thinking/googling for key local events and locations with an eye for the ghost/supernatural twist.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>"The Magic City" (a safe haven for the supernatural in a cold dark world) <br/><br/>Birmingham Alabama <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama</a><br/><br/>City Aspects (NOTE: These aspects are specifically made for a one-shot convention game listed below. They are probably more specific than I would use for a long term game):<br/><br/>New Mt Olympus <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/ALBIRvulcan.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/ALBIRvulcan.html</a>:  City grew up at an incredible pace after Vulcan and the remaining Roman/Greek gods moved their home to Birmingham.  Steps from the top of Vulcan's statue lead to the halls of the gods.  As such, the city is under a special ban of the Accords.<br/><br/>Red Mountain (AKA Iron Mountain, AKA The Mountain of Blood) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Mountain,_Birmingham,_Alabama" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Mountain,_Birmingham,_Alabama</a>:  The mountain spitting Birmingham in half is a haunt of black magic and demons.  The storms that break on its face bespeak the wrath contained within.  On the new moons, moans and dripping blood comes from the great cut face of the mountain.  No one knows what is contained within. What 'bleeds' out on dark nights seems to be a warning. This comes through a V shaped cut in the mountain made for an expressway that was completed in 1970.  Several sorcerers have been put down by the council for attepting to tap this power. The White Council has tapped a local wizard to keep an eye on this but he just died. His apprentice will be a part of the game either as a PC or NPC.  Of note, the Vulcan statue overlooks this area and rarely the gods send Invidia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invidia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invidia</a> to punish those who disturb the mountain.<br/><br/>White Court feeding ground <a href="http://www.800alabama.com/things-to-do/activities/alabama-history/civil-rights.cfm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.800alabama.com/things-to-do/activities/alabama-history/civil-rights.cfm</a>:  Birmingham had an influx of White Court vampires during the height of the civil rights struggle.  Many have moved on but a strong contingent remains stirring up hatred and violence to slake their thirst.<br/><br/>Summer and Winter battleground: <a href="http://geology.com/news/2007/severe-drought-in-alabama-and-georgia.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://geology.com/news/2007/severe-drought-in-alabama-and-georgia.shtml</a> Winter is attacking this Summer stronghold.  The Accords are no protection beyond the city limits as both sides have claimed to be agrieved.  Any Faeries may be challenge or attack if judged to have been a part of the breach.<br/><br/>Science! will not save you <a href="http://main.uab.edu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://main.uab.edu/</a> The scientists at UAB are delving into the dark frontiers of science.  Pushing the envelope to secure that next grant.  They have tapped into forces they do not understand and can not control.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other important locations include "Druid City" to the south in Tusacloosa, home to an very old and powerful non-White Council wizard organization.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>More information about Birmingham:<br/><br/>Who cares about this city?<br/>There was a wizard, Philip McGee, who watched over the city and tried to keep Red Mountain from being used for mischief but he died yesterday.  The Summer Court claims this region under it protection since time <br/>immemorial.  A special group of non-White Council wizards (Druids) live a few mile to the south and are interested in any supernatural activities.  The White Court (House Malvora) are throughout the upper escheons of Birmingham Society and take their continued freedom to feed very seriously.  <br/><br/>Who keeps the peace?<br/>Well, thats a funny question.  Within the city no one dares openly attack others due to the special ban of the Accords.  You see, this is the new home of the Roman Gods and they don't take kindly to anyone screwing around.  Any open attack within the city limits between two different groups will be met with swift reprisal.  This usually means Invidia destroys you but individual gods (cruel and capricious as ever) may develop an interest in what is going on.  This as a practical matter means that the letter and spirit of the Accords is give great weight in the city.  This has made Birmingham an unlikely but viable spot for negotiations and meetings between supernatural entities.  <br/><br/>How do mortals cope?<br/>Mortals have their police and others to help them.  Although not protected by the ban the supernatural is very careful to stay 'behind the scenes' making most attacks and disturbances easier to explain away.<br/><br/>What kind of supernatural community is there is town?<br/>The White Court vampires sow dissent and anger throughout town.  The race issues have never fully healed and there are serious corruption and drug sub-cultures.  There was only one White Court wizard and his appentice who kept to themselves at a small farm north of town.  There are a few people who believe they have some real power (witches, vamp/goth groups etc) but these are just lunch if they run into a real entity.<br/><br/>What interests the supernatural tourist?<br/>Seeing the gods, while not healthy, is an opportunity some can not pass up.  There is a stable group of ghosts that live in and around the Tutwiler Hotel ranging from Indian medicine men, to civil war generals, to racial protesters. The "Devil Fountain"  <a href="http://www.bhamonline.com/Storyteller/TheStoryteller.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bhamonline.com/Storyteller/TheStoryteller.htm</a>  is a connection to a faerie spirit that will bargain with supernatural and 'aware' mortals (often under the influence of drugs).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136147/#Comment_136147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T11:54:53+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 11:54AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2008 12:20PM by Scott.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/bleeder-badge.png"/><br/><br/>Information will be trickling out on my livejournal.<br/><br/><a href="http://johnpaul613.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://johnpaul613.livejournal.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136148/#Comment_136148" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T11:57:36+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 11:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DFRPG Characters<br/><br/>Name: Michael Stutts                                                 <br/>High Concept: Special Cases Detective                      <br/>Personal Struggle: Personal Recognition Vs.

I don't always get the recognition I deserve because the cases I deal with are just so freakin unbelievable.  <br/><br/>(Convention senario question.  Replaces second guest starring role) Why do you want to know the answer to Philip McGee's death?  The local wizard and I have scuffled over territory and infomation many times.  He was a hard guy to get to know but I think he's been on the right side of things as long as I've known him.  Once I was in deep in an early Red Court incursion...I would've died but he had been watching out for me and took them out.  That's when I realized he wanted to make this city a better place, he just had a hard time showing it.<br/><br/>What was your first story?  "The Case of the Missing Day"  My first case in special investigations and my sister goes missing, I lose a day, my captain thinks I've gone crazy and I start seeing death people.  By the end I've had a hand in kicking some Red Court butt and lost my sister.  She talks to me from beyond the grave from time to time trying to get me to solve her murder.  <br/><br/>(Filled in at the convention) Who's story did you guest star in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136149/#Comment_136149" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T11:59:00+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 11:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DFRPG Characters<br/><br/>Name: Grace Chandler                                               <br/>High Concept: Supernatural Reporter                         <br/>Personal Struggle: The Story Vs.

I'm the only child of Raymond and Elizabeth Chandler heirs to the vast US Steel holdings in Alabama.  We lived on a small 250 acre compound east of Birmingham.  I was tutored and toured the world while growing up.  My parents were into the occult and died in a summoning went wrong when I was 20 years old.<br/><br/>What shaped you?  Well, the death of my parents came as a shock.  I never knew about their indulging in occult practices.  Family servants and friends tried to cover it up but I had to know what happened.  Learning about the depths of depravity and shadow they kept private from me hurt...a lot.  For the next 10 years I drifted until I fell into my current 'hobby' of reporting.  It seems I have a knack of being in the right place at the right time.  Now, I just need to get my editor to believe me.  <br/><br/>(Convention scenario question.  Replaces second guest starring role) Why do you want to know the answer to Philip McGee's death?  The wizard kept showing up at some of the most bizarre settings.  I know he's in deep with the problems around town.  I just am not sure if he's the problem or the solution.<br/><br/>What was your first story?  "High Society"  After my first few unusual cases my editor tried to get me to look into society reporting.  I guess he thought that with my background I would be a natural.  After a war between the White Court Vampires and Ghouls over the rod of Amun-Set  at the museum of art he put me back on my regular beat.  <br/><br/>(Filled in at the convention) Who's story did you guest star in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136150/#Comment_136150" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T12:00:09+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 12:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2008 12:00PM by Scott.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DFRPG Characters<br/><br/>Name: Brother Gabriel                                               <br/>High Concept: Evangelist Friar with a line to God     <br/>Personal Struggle: Family Vs.

I was born Jason Gabriel Buckwald III a spoiled and lazy only child of a workaholic doctor and his spoiled and lazy wife.  I grew up in Mountain Brook and had a few friends in common with Grace.  She was way out of my league though.  <br/><br/>What shaped you?  After graduating high school I received a basketball scholarship to Alabama.  We had a pretty deep run into the NCAA tournament but got cut off at the knees by Duke in the final four.  That game changed my life when a pile up ended with me tearing my ACL.  Left school and was pretty depressed, got into drugs and spent some time on the streets.  Finally I was found by a homeless shelter founded by the Francican friars at EWTN.  Right after this I started having visions of angels, Jesus, Mary and the celestial choir.  Sometimes they told me to do stuff.  I eventually joined the friars for a while but never took my final vows...my 'visions' and divine direction talk never fit in well.  <br/><br/>(Convention scenario question.  Replaces second guest starring role) Why do you want to know the answer to Philip McGee's death?    He was a confused and nearly lost soul.  I had taken to giving him spiritual direction and learned about his troubles keeping the city safe.  He deserved better.  Also, whoever killed him surely has bad intentions for this city.  <br/><br/>What was your first story?  "The Hand of God"  My first vision told me to look into a string of suicides downtown.  What I found was a Sorcerer cult with a nasty spell on its members forcing them to kill themselves if trying to leave.  I managed to help three escape and laid a lick on the Coven leader but he got away.  I learned to not hold back when fighting evil.<br/><br/>(Filled in at the convention) Who's story did you guest star in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136152/#Comment_136152" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T12:15:06+00:00" title="March 24, 2008 12:15PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DFRPG Characters<br/><br/>Name: Seth <br/>High Concept: Changeling Gargoyle <br/>Personal Struggle: Protecting others Vs.

I was born to a visionary young mother who inherited a knack for finding ways into the Nevernever.  Her travels led her to a Summer Court faerie named Thorn.  He loved her so much he left the Nevernever and tied himself to her city.  As long as she stayed there he would remain with her.  They had one child, me, a Changeling who never got to know his father.  When I was 3 my father, tried to stop the Winter Queen from destroying the priest that married my parents.  My father died but exposed the Winter Knight to the full brunt of Invidia (Roman God of Divine Retribution).  This blocked the Winter Court from attacking the Southn U.S. for half a generation.<br/><br/>What shaped you?  With my parents dead I was raised by Father Patrick at the Cathedral of St Paul.  I was quiet and introverted but no one ever messed with me cause I grew into a muscle bound freak.  Well, that's how I saw myself in the mirror.  I tried to go to college but I was not the sharpest tool in the shed.   Until I met Phil McGee I was a landscaper, gaming on the weekends.  He introduced me to my relatives in the Summer Court and put in a good word for me with the Summer Knight.  The Summer Knight trained me in combat and showed me where my birthright may lead.<br/><br/>(Convention scenario question.  Replaces second guest starring role) Why do you want to know the answer to Philip McGee's death?    Phil showed me who I was, what I could do and what I could become.  He saved me from selling my soul to the Winter Queen and helped me take control of my life.  He was like a father to me.<br/><br/>What was your first story?  "Stone Cold"  What do you do when you learn your girlfriend is a Banshee and your Catholic school is about to be cursed by Nichodemos?  How do you save your friends without letting them know you look suspiciously like a demon yourself.  <br/><br/>(Filled in at the convention) Who's story did you guest star in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
