Roughly speaking, I'm talking about the design and play traditions that fed into <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a>, were created on it, or came out of it by one or more generations' distance from it (in other words, games influenced by games influenced by (etc.) games developed on The Forge).<br/><br/>What features do these games tend to have? What kinds of things make you look at a game and go, "Yep, it's one of those?"<br/><br/>I realize that this may be a difficult-to-parse question, so maybe my personal examples will help illuminate it:<br/><br/>* Emphasis on what's interesting rather than what's physically possible<br/>* De-emphasized combat, as compared to most games in RPG history<br/>* All players have roughly the same level of power at the table (this doesn't mean identical power, it just means roughly equal)<br/>* Structured play, especially structures around scenes, stories, and plots<br/>* Short-run, lower-session-count games, as compared to....<br/>* Design that focuses on what the game is about<br/>* Exclusive design rather than all-encompassing design; that is to say design where the mechanics touch the things that the game cares about, rather than attempting to encompass everything that might happen during a game<br/>* Shorter pre-game prep time<br/>* Lack of a GM<br/>* De-emphasis or lack of pre-planning of a session's material (e.g., "GM plot")<br/>* De-emphasis or lack of secrets between players of the game<br/><br/>(There are many more I think.)<br/><br/>A few disclaimers/notes/thread mod thingies:<br/><br/>* Identity politics are not welcome here. I'm not talking about a litmus test of what is and what is not ideologically pure. I'm looking for a description of common elements, trends, themes that you see in these games.<br/>* I don't want to argue about whether this design area exists. I think it does, and it seems like an entirely uncontroversial statement to me.<br/>* These things don't need to be present in every game.<br/>* I'm not looking for a grand unified theory, the common denominator, I'm looking for recurrent features.<br/>* This is descriptive, not proscriptive.<br/>* I don't want to argue about what the games should be called. Forge-derived? Indie? Hippy? Swine? Fligleflorp? I don't care and if you want to argue about that, as Swamp Thing said, "Do not bring your evil here."<br/>* If someone says "this makes it one of those" don't argue with them. I want their opinions, not Truth.<br/>* That said, if someone offers something and you don't understand it, asking for clarification is totally in-bounds                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234127/#Comment_234127" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-24T15:04:18+00:00" title="September 24, 2009  3:04PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see a lot more of what they call "conflict resolution" as opposed to "task resolution."

If they have one, the GM can have any kind of different powers in the game rules, but never power on the social level, above the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) ...don't <i>demand</i> that one player at the table assume the role of the entertainer for the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) (corollary and consequence of 1,2,6,7) Are really fun to GM: if you GM you are still playing, not fulfilling a role that is "work". Also, they are easier and less scary to GM: people who would have never GMed try, and sometimes discover they are very good GMs!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there is more, but it's a start.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Disclaimer:</i> I know some of my points are potentially inflamatory, but please don't litter this thread: open a new one if you (generic, internet-you) feel like flaming on them: I wont follow you there, though <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234193/#Comment_234193" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T00:06:53+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 12:06AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of these "greater emphasis" ones sound a bit wishy-washy to me when it seems like we can track specific techniques to specific disseminating games.

In my experience this is the lowest common denominator for Forge games vs. traditional design, the one from which all other differences accrue.

I'll actually engage with the thread and maybe you'll see why I'm so annoyed.<br/><br/>Just as an example: the GM.  Anyone who says Forge games are down on GMs in any way has not read very many and this apparently very common and standard conclusion is baffling to me.<br/><br/>Sorcerer has a normal GM.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age fails and fails hard without an active, forward-looking GM advocating for NPCs and setting up adversity and situations and doing exactly everything a D&amp;D GM does, including preparing stat blocks.<br/><br/>Dogs In The Vineyard is that times one thousand billion, forever.<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures has a GM.  Narration rights only pass once per conflict, significantly less than, say, Feng Shui or Adventure!<br/><br/>The Burning games have a GM. (At least the ones I've read do.)<br/><br/>With Great Power has a very, very important GM.<br/><br/>The only ones I can think of right off the bat that don't have anything like a GM are Capes, Universalis and Polaris.  (Penny For My Thoughts doesn't have a GM, but it does have a "teach the game" position, the Reader, so it can fit in here too.)  Of course I haven't read all Forge games, but those are the ones that jump to mind.<br/><br/>So here is the correct generalization about Forge games:<br/><br/><i>They are pretty much like all the other games out there: extremely varied and meant to be fun.</i><br/><br/>"Indie" is a term of financial arrangements and has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the content of games, so pretty much that's a bust.<br/><br/>And story games are games that consider story one of the goals, either as by-product or in-the-moment consideration, so vast swathes of what I absolutely refuse to call "traditional" RPGs are story games.<br/><br/>That leaves "whatever", which is basically my response to the whole thread. Whatever.<br/><br/>Except that this claimed distinction deserves to be enshrined forever in a marble monument at the Wrong Memorial in the city of Wrongtropolis, capital of Wrongtopia, motto, "We're Wrong All The Time", celebrated by parades and laying of wreaths every year while children salute the Wrongtopia flag and the Wrongtopian Air Force flies overhead:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>These games...1) ...are actually designed to work as written.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234363/#Comment_234363" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T11:11:06+00:00" title="September 26, 2009 11:11AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><i>They are pretty much like all the other games out there: extremely varied and meant to be fun.</i></blockquote>\nI disagree with that\u2014pretty much all the other RPG's out there look like clones of D&amp;D to me. They all have a GM who comes to the table with the plot in mind. They all have players who have only their own character. They all have mechanics that involve rolling some dice and adding your modifiers, then comparing the result to a target set by the GM. They all define characters in terms of attributes and statistics. So, maybe the best definition for these ill-defined games actually defines them negatively: just everything that <em>doesn't</em> work just like D&amp;D.

"What's in a (.....story..) game?" Why did you only pick out the word "Forge" from the list of descriptors? Did you read the list as hierarchical? To me it just seemed more like groping around for the right word, and trying to be as inclusive as possible. <br/><br/>And the way I read your comment was that it was about liking the games discussed here way more than those "other" games discussed on other forums. To the point of making hyperbolic pronouncements. I mean it's not like that's a particularly strange way for roleplaying geeks to post on forums. <br/><br/>So is your main beef with this thread, that there's too much emphasis on Forge games here? Or that people are drawing an arbitrary distinction between roleplaying games. Because if it's the latter, I'm afraid, that battle has been lost. Most people do distinguish between "traditional" RPGs and story games. Whether this distinction is justified, useful or even sensible... is up to debate. But the distinction is there, and one might as well try to deal with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234370/#Comment_234370" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T13:01:05+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  1:01PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2009 1:03PM by jason.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>Like, say, Dogs in the Vineyard, which has a GM who comes up with a town via the rules, the players only have their own character, the mechanics involve rolling some dice and comparing the result to the GM's dice and the characters are defined in terms of attributes and statistics?</blockquote>\nLike I said, if you do anything different, you fall into this "other" category\u2014you don't have to break all those rules to do so, just some of them. In Dogs, the GM does not come to the table with the plot already in mind. He has a town, but he doesn't really know where the story might go. As opposed to D&amp;D, where a GM might not know how you'll get there, but he has a clear idea of how the story will progress, regardless. You don't compare what you've rolled to a target set by the GM\u2014you compare it to what the GM rolls. So, he can't just make things arbitrarily difficult. Yes, D&amp;D has opposed checks, but those happen relatively infrequently. And the characters are not defined by attributes and statistics--at least, not by the same definition of "attributes" and "statistics" as in so-called "traditional" RPG's. You'll never find anything like "I love my boy 2d4" on a D&amp;D character sheet.<br/><br/>By comparison (to test if this seems like a legitimately significant difference), compare World of Darkness and D&amp;D. There, the GM <em>does</em> come to the table with the plot in mind. You roll against a number set by the GM. You don't have an open-ended set of attributes, as in Dogs; in both, you have a small number of attributes, and a set skill list, both of which you define with a number. For reasons like this, I don't distinguish much between these two games\u2014or between D&amp;D and Shadowrun, or D&amp;D and Legend of the Five Rings, etc. They all seem like clones of each to me, all closer to one another than any two of these "other" games I could think of.<br/><br/>Not to derail, but people around here seem a bit overly sensitive to the looming threat of identity politics. A learned response from many past encounters, no doubt, but the ability to <em>distinguish</em> between two different things does not automatically entail a judgment about one's superiority over the other. Frankly, I can think of few real examples of one thing superior to another thing: just different things adapted to different circumstances, so "better" always has to come with the assumed qualifier "at _____." Anyway, it seems to me that some folks need to calm down, and wait until some identity politics <em>have actually appeared</em> before jumping on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234371/#Comment_234371" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T13:30:53+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  1:30PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand what JDCorley is saying.  It's just as easy to argue that all the games in the hobby are spread out in a giant multi-armed gradient of factors.  This thread seems to be trying to say that there are two distinct types of games in the hobby, those that are this one thing and those that are not.  Looking at the long list of examples in JDCorley's post makes that distinction seem very flawed.  What is the single factor or grouping of factors that make all these games this one thing?  It seems that it's community more than anything inherent in the games themselves.  Some will argue that there is a certain theory behind them that they all share, but that seems as multi-faceted and varied in its development as all the games themselves.  Furthermore, the theories that have arisen in gaming in the last 10 years have touched many sectors of design in the hobby in many different ways.  From the tone of this thread, it sounds like there is also an instinct to do something different that is shared by these designs.  But you can say that for the wave of new rules-light to medium genre-emulating designers out there such as Simon Washburne, Cynthia Celeste Miller and Chris Rutkowsky to name a few who don't seem to be considered part of this one thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresciptively speaking, I think it's better for our hobby to not impose these kind of self-isolating and separating labels.  the more dynamic interplay between schools of thought and design, the richer and more interesting the designs become.  I do think the Forge-inspired and story games contributed a lot to the hobby, but it is fracturing and spreading out as well as opening itself up to outside influence to such a point that I don't think you can define an integral form any more.  And that's a good thing.

It just means you can identify similarities. That helps you understand the relationships, allowing for more of that dynamic interplay, and helps you understand what that fully entails. Can you imagine trying to study biology without any concept of species? Yes, you can find cases where those definitions become fuzzy, but without them, we'd have a very hard time understanding anything like evolution.<br><br>Finding the right way to distinguish different types of games helps us understand games, which in turn helps us understand what we design better, and gives us better games. Heck, look how many games just came from the elementary understanding that different people get different things from different games, so rather than trying to satisfy all of those agendas at once, you should design to support one.<br/><br/>As I said in my last comment, I think we can make distinctions without falling into identity politics. Identity politics needs distinctions, but the reverse does not hold.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234375/#Comment_234375" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T14:43:46+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  2:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think anyone is arguing that categorizing or labelling is inherently bad.

Or "the golden rule": : "the GM is above the rules".  This is true in almost every "traditional" rpg (with very few exceptions like the James Bond RPG). And it's NOT true in every Forge game I know. This is the BIG difference, that you are willfully ignoring.<br/><br/>The GM in dogs is a "normal" GM? Really?<br/>Tell me, in "traditional" rpgs, the GM is FORCED, by RULES, to "say yes or roll the dice"?  Has a LIMITED pool of resources for conflicts? Has RULES about NPC creation that he has to follow? has RULES about scenario (town) creation?<br/>Do you know that, in Italian forums, where they were not "prepared" by the previous Forge rpgs to accept these things, the initial general reaction was "this is NOT a RPG", and "it's impossible to GM a game in this way", and "who wrote this game really hate GMs"?<br/><br/>Let's call some rules for this discussion.<br/><br/>1) "what is a game system?".  I consider a game's system the one given by the lumpley principle: the procedure really utilized to change the SIS. No matter what the game manual says.<br/><br/>2) with very few exceptions, the procedure utilized by EVERY "traditional" rpg is ALWAYS THE SAME: "ask the GM, and the GM will tell you". We can call this single game "mother may I". The so-called "rules" inside the game manual aren't real rules at all, they are "suggestions": the proof is that the player can't use them without the GM' permission.<br/><br/>Talking about systems, and single rules, we have not the "rule zero", but the "system zero", the system of Mother-May-I<br/><br/>This system has the following characteristic:<br/>1) the world is always descripted by the GM, even to the littlest scenographic elements: the player can't say "I grab a horse outside the saloon", he has to ask the GM before: "GM, there is a horse outside the saloon?". The player can't add nothing to the game world, he has to ask the GM first.<br/>2) The results from the rolls (or the resolution system in general) are always narrated by the GM<br/>3) The players can use the resolution system to do something, but not to achieve something or get a specific result. It's always at the GM's whim and discretion what happen as a result or achievement after the player do (or fail to do) his action (task resolution)<br/>4) It's always the GM that say when the player can roll the dice (or use the game specific resolution system), or the action is impossible, and it's the GM who say WHEN you roll, TO DO WHAT and say to you if you CAN use your traits or what you have on the character sheet.<br/>5) The GM can change any rule, anytime, anywhere, at whim, without having to tell anybody about it.<br/>6) The resolution system is at least in part "secret", allowing the GM to ignore the real results and choose the results that he want instead. This is NOT considered "cheating" in system-zero, but it's considered "good GM-ing" even if the players are not informed about this GM's "power", and even if they would not agree and they would really be enraged if they will know. (the adherence to an abstract "good way to GMing" is considered better than reaching an agreement among the players about the rules, in "system-zero". It's not only allowed, but even told as an advice, in "traditional" rpg books, to lie to players about the real rules used)<br/><br/>Now, the real problem in determining the common characteristics of Forge games, is that it's "traditional" rpgs that have this COMMON system, not Forge games. How can you define "every other game system apart from this single one?"<br/><br/>Like that: Forge games are not system zero. Almost every single "traditional" rpg in commerce IS. They are, almost all, exactly always the same exact game system (system zero), with the same experience of play ("Mother-may-I")<br/><br/>This has a problem: give little credit to the few games that, even when everybody else jumped on the bandwagon, refused to go to system-zero-land, as James Bond RPGs, or even, for clear historical reasons, OD&amp;D (but AD&amp;D 1st was already system-zero, the DMG is really clear on this. Vampire really only went a little further on Gygax's path). And to games are not "traditional" but not "forge" either.<br/><br/>The first ones can be considered a more limited subset of system-zero, they usually only have the first 4 characteristics, and a more limited form of the 5th that allow the GM to make on-the-spot rulings, but not in secret. They could be called "old school" and we could leave it at that.<br/><br/>About new games that are not tied to the forge... it's becoming difficult to say exactly what it's forge-influenced these days or not. once upon a time, if you were forge-influenced, you were on the forge, period. Now, someone could not even know that the forge exist, but could have played some game of Dogs in the Vinweyard, and be inspired to write a game of his own, with conflict resolution, fortune in the middle, shared narrational authority, limited reasources for the GM, and the game could be at the end a coherent narrativist design... what we could call this game? It's a forge game? Even if the designer don't even know that the forge exist? It's not? Even if is a compilation of second-hand forge techniques and design philosophies? <br/><br/>Everybody draw the line differently, I suppose. For example, I consider Don't Rest Your Head a Forge game, and Spirit of the Century not, but the line is becoming more and more blurred with time.<br/><br/>Robert, I think that this thread could go one way or the other: if you want to define what forge games ARE, I think we can't do it in any meaningful way without considering what they AREN'T (system-zero), and this could drown this thread in flames.  Or we could consider the evolution of forge games, historically, to see how all this happened, even if this will lead to consider games like D&amp;D4.

I believe it should be read as "the fiction is above the rules". In traditional games the GM takes on the role of the fiction's groundkeeper, lately and especially in story games this responsibility has been spread among all the players. <br/><br/>Which is how you arrive at "The GM can change the rules" with traditional games and "Follow the fiction" with story games. The intent is essentially the same, but looked at through a different lens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234383/#Comment_234383" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T15:35:27+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  3:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's worth it to distinguish between game texts and cultures of play, of course. Texts may be so radically indeterminate of play that no group ever plays the same game as any other group, as some people here have asserted, but there are enough ethnographic and autobiographical accounts of play out there to support the claim that consistencies in styles of play exist even in the face of variations across groups. That being the case, it's worth wondering if there are systematic variations in styles of play, and what the source of those systematic variations is (not the unreliable game-text? then the historical development of "discourses of gaming"--communities of play!--facilitated by game conventions, player migration, and so forth). Of course, in this view, the game-text can never be separated from the players using it to play, so that D&amp;D 4e run by RPGA hard-liners is going to be a completely different experience than D&amp;D 4e run by hippie story-gamers, should either category of person actually exist.<br/><br/>So maybe Rob is asking about culture-of-play rather than texts per se. It's probably too divisive to want to distinguish between "traditional" and "progressive" (or "radical") cultures of play (<i>pace</i>, Eero!), but certainly some such distinction exists--witness the reviewer who "just didn't get" <i>Burning Empires</i> (unless you want to regard him as a unique case).<br/><br/>It occurs to me that the lines of division are possibly best couched in terms of how people read texts! So you might have folks who see D&amp;D as essentially continuous versus those who see huge discontinuities between versions, for example and folks who see no important distinction in <i>Capes</i> vs. <i>With Great Power</i> because players are allowed to make shit up in both versus those who see them as totally opposite because in <i>Capes</i> you're supposed to have fun but in WGP you're supposed to suffer.<br/><br/>Shit. I gotta go lie down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234385/#Comment_234385" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T15:45:58+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  3:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2009 3:51PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Edited away.

I believe it should be read as "the fiction is above the rules". In traditional games the GM takes on the role of the fiction's groundkeeper, lately and especially in story games this responsibility has been spread among all the players.<br/><br/>Which is how you arrive at "The GM can change the rules" with traditional games and "Follow the fiction" with story games. The intent is essentially the same, but looked at through a different lens.<br/><br/>No, no, go to your library and check what the game texts REALLY say. They are usually REALLY explicit about this, with "advices" like always lying to the player, even with no reason, "punishing" characters for player's transgressions about the "pecking order" at the table, and discarding the rules from the get-go as useless anyway.<br/><br/>I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span> have to post a couple dozen of examples from the best selling "traditional" game systems, from AD&amp;D to Vampire to Tri-stat to Unknown Armies to everybody else? I am really, really tired to having to that. This shit has been posted like, every week from almost forever, somewhere in the web, in these discussions, and STILL there is the need to post examples? You have all the examples you need in your game library, check them, please.<br/><br/>The misreading usually go the other way around: people after  a while stop reading the GM' text in games (why bother, they are all the same, it's always the same game), so after a while they think that what their old GM did was HIS fault, and that he did overstep his game authority.  They don't realize that he was only following the game book advice.<br/><br/>Usually, when I point people to what the game they are using REALLY say, they are shocked.  Especially if they never played it as the GM.<br/><br/>[edit: crossposted with some people, Robert among them.  His answer confused me, though: I am not sure anymore what he wants in this thread.

I'm not looking for lists to compare and declare one kind of game traditional and another kind indie. I don't know how I could have made the point clearer than in the first post.

I guess I was hoping that "design relationships" were of the form "these have no permanent GM", "these have meters for mental attributes", "these break the character monogamy assumption", etc. Sigh. Yeah, mere genealogy is less interesting and easier. Although JWalt's visualizations are pretty cool!<br/><br/>Postmodernism... geez. I started to write this up as a new thread in March. I have this rambling text file sitting on my computer now, trying to find a balance between "this doesn't seem like it will start an interesting conversation" and "this thread will fill up with cock before I hit the 'submit' button." Provisionally, I'd appreciate a charitable reading. I mean whatever you think I might reasonably mean. Blurring the critique/creation line, commenting on criticism in text, intertextuality, meta-ness, medium and genre awareness, deconstruction, a skeptical but playful approach to the assumptions of previous works, the (im)possibility of anti-art, prefixes in parentheses. "Postmodern." You know!<br/><br/>Hey, I have another thing to throw out. Someone said that "indie game" is orthogonal to "Forge game". I disagree wholeheartedly - the two concepts twist around each other intimately. Forge games are punk rock. The designers aren't rock stars hiding behind large men in yellow shirts. St Vincent is in the pit at every show. You have a problem with Dogs, you can take it up with the man himself, and he, or the community he has helped build, can put you on the right track. I have immense respect for Jonathan Tweet's work, but I doubt he, or any of the dozen people credited in the text, feels any personal investment in my table's issues with Everway. Mark Rein Dot Hagen is too busy with his hookers and blow to visit the kids he put in the neuro ward (Colin said, bowing to tradition). But Seth Ben Dash Ezra wrote an email to me to see how I was doing with his game, because he cares, probably because it is his work that he owns from beginning to end. He did it himself. Seth is punk rock. And Showdown is a Forge game. It is also awesome.<br/><br/>And despite the fact that I'm new to this part of the gaming hobby, everywhere I've turned, I've seen that generosity.<br/><br/>If twelve Wizards of the Coast wrote a game tomorrow that credited Roach as a design inspiration, that assigned narration rights to every player in the RAW, that established a reward cycle based on contributions to addressing premise, that had no GM or whatever, I still believe that people wouldn't quite be willing to call it a Forge game. It might be very good - they've got some smart people working there - but it wouldn't be punk rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234406/#Comment_234406" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-26T21:45:01+00:00" title="September 26, 2009  9:45PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say, Rob, I'm with Moreno here.

This is a diagram of techniques families. No one post it, please; I just fixed it and your versions are tehsuxx. On the left-hand side, one superfamily is rooted in stuff like Over the Edge and Cyberpunk and goes on through the "door" of Sorcerer, branching apart from there. It includes Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>On the right-hand side, the other superfamily is rooted in stuff like Story Engine and Soap, and it goes on through the "door" of Universalis, branching apart rather drastically from there. It includes (via MLWM) Polaris.<br/>.....................................................................<br/>On the side which includes Dogs, single participants have overriding, brutal, arbitrary authority over the "II" of IIEE. In other words, what their characters want to do and start to do cannot be overriden or even mechanically modified by anyone else at the table. If you state, "He kisses her," and the group goes into the Conflict Resolution system, it's established, the kiss is both intended and initiated.<br/><br/>On the side which includes Polaris, the entire IIEE of any character's actions/etc is subject to vetting of some kind, whether it's negation, modification, or letting it lie, and whether it's full-group or by a designated person. All actions are subject to drastic reinterpretations of the outcomes of Conflict Resolution. Including the first "I," intent, of IIEE. If you state, "He kisses her," then eventually, the way the scene works out, it's at least possible that he never even thought about or tried to kiss her. <br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234431/#Comment_234431" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T04:08:46+00:00" title="September 27, 2009  4:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2009 4:09AM by Clinton.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong>Observed Features of Said Games</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>They often contain large-scale resolution systems</li>\n<li>They sometimes do not respect character ownership</li>\n<li>They list their influences openly</li>\n<li>They often aren't well-playtested</li>\n<li>They require someone immersed in their culture of creation to be fun</li>\n<li>They often replace adventure with melodrama</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20Jensen" title="Tim Jensen"><img alt="Tim Jensen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20Jensen">Tim Jensen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234442/#Comment_234442" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T07:54:05+00:00" title="September 27, 2009  7:54AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two categories of games that Ron sketched out on that sheet of paper at 1:00am on Saturday night, GenCon 06 in the Embassy Suites lobby cafeteria were labeled "No one gets hurt" (the MLWM school) and "I will not abandon you" (the Sorceror school).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs "They often aren't well-playtested" really a common attribute of first-generation story games?

The reason that "focused" design is so important is because Forge-ish designers don't assume that players will drift their games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234446/#Comment_234446" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-27T09:04:28+00:00" title="September 27, 2009  9:04AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wow this thread is like a miniforge/indierpg discussion website/story games. <br/><br/>It starts out with a descriptive process that leads to inevitible bickering as the original taxonomy is challenged, and then hidden in its crippled state behind various links to year old crap and cries from the op that we're not really here to talk about that, and then it becomes a argument between those who agree with the hiding of the taxonomy and those who don't.

Instead, the rules emphasize what the game is about.  Combat is still a big part of many (Dogs, In A Wicked Age, Capes, Burning Wheel, 3:16). However, the rules for combat rarely overshadow rules for other types of conflict, or personal or dramatic changes, or what have you. At least they usually are given precisely equal weight - usually because the mechanic is the same. But in some games, like Burning Wheel and 3:16: combat still plays a pretty big role.<br/><br/>And D&amp;D 4E essentially has killed any huge division between "indie" and "mainstream". Because D&amp;D is the most mainstream game there is. It's also hugely indie/forge/whatever in its design. Each rule is very clear and focused. The game as a whole has a main drive of gaining power though adventure conflict, and everything else helps build towards.<br/><br/>That's because there's one thing that made Forge games unique for the better part of the decade. The game designers were actually looking at the goals of the game and making rules to support those goals. Before that, all our RPGs were looking at other games and making tweaks and changes. More detailed combat here, more detailed character creation there, more variety in character actions/skills/abilities here. Brownie points for making jokes. Removal of death for cartoons.  And so forth.<br/><br/>Then the Forge style sweeps through and for the first time, really starts culling these assumptions. We get new games that get rid of separate combat rules because it's not important. Games that get rid of the GM because that's not important. Gets rid of weapon charts or power lists because those aren't important.  And of course, all the while, new stuff is added in like always.<br/><br/>And now we've started to come full circle, 4E defined a central goal for the game and then dumped a huge amount of accumulation from D&amp;D that did not contribute to that central goal. And then completely new systems were added back in to help support that central goal better.  It looks like Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay may be following suit (though perhaps leanring more from board games than indie games, we'll see). There's still a market for generalist design, but specific design has grown out of its indie roots. Much like rap in the 80's, we're no longer just playing on the streets my homies, and while there's still room for other styles of play, our influence will be felt and will permanently change the landscape of gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234499/#Comment_234499" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-28T03:32:18+00:00" title="September 28, 2009  3:32AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, this are some of the things I see as common in pretty much all indie games, they:<br/>- quickly generate a rich background with characters and locations against which to foreground the adventure<br/>- don't have levels or traditional experience point systems<br/>- have accessible designers<br/>- are trying to do something a bit different<br/>- to differing degrees, share the creation process between the players (and GM if present)<br/><br/>Things I like about indie games but which aren't present in all, they:<br/>- integrate design and content<br/>- are relatively inexpensive<br/>- have open playtesting<br/>- have lots of play examples<br/><br/>Things I don't like about indie games and which are present in several, they:<br/>- have indifferent art<br/>- aren't edited to any great degree<br/>- require good knowledge of indie games to be run<br/>- work only if played a certain way, typically the gaming style of the designers group<br/><br/>And no, I'm not going to name names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234740/#Comment_234740" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T13:57:30+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  1:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>I'd also like to re-postulate my thesis that "Forge games" are postmodern, or react to postmodernism.</blockquote>Yeah, I'll touch the tar baby, too.<br/><br/>"Forge Games" are generally some of the most structuralist, modernist things I've ever seen.  It's like <em>Anatomy of Criticism</em> made into a roleplaying game, complete with defining, tracking, and consciously reincorporating themes and motifs.  Building art from the ground up, starting with first principles.  Significantly, note that narrativism's definition of "story" is based on a (mis)reading of Lagos Egri, who was very much a structuralist.  It doesn't help that something like half of the Forge-derived game designers are scientists and engineers, and design and write according to the principles with which they are familiar in their day jobs.<br/><br/>Seriously, this thread itself is an exemplar of how pervasive structuralist thinking is in the indiesphere: assume a category exists, then define it.  My pomo-trained head sort of rebels at the very idea.<br/><br/>I don't even <em>know</em> what a "postmodern" roleplaying game would look like, but it wouldn't look like anything we've seen yet.  Like, if Jonathan Walton and Jared Sorensen had a love child, she might write a postmodern roleplaying game.<br/><br/>...sigh.

That's quintessentially structuralist, especially when you add in shades of one-true-wayism and begin to think that "this theoretical framework" is the only way to make a "real" story (or a story of artistic merit, however you choose to privilege your praxis).  <em>Compound</em> that with the fact that storygamers don't really play exclusively from the book, but from the book and a generous helping of their Forge-derived collection of techniques from other games, and you get a pretty potent canon that is followed rather strictly.<br/><br/><em>At best</em>, an ever-evolving pastiche of play techniques drawn from many different sources might be creeping towards something resembling postmodern play.  Now, most Forge-derived players are probably leaping up to claim that they do that right now, but... no, not really.  A perspective that encompasses a handful of perspectives (rather than just one perspective like those filthy trad players) isn't really that broad at all \u2014 not when there are literally <em>millions</em> of perspectives you can draw from the rest of the world's history, art, science, and current events.<br/><br/>And just to be clear: I'm counting myself among the beggars with a handful of perspectives.  I don't think I've ever contemplated what pomo play would look like, let alone attempted it.  It would be... dizzying, I think.\n<blockquote>Up one more level: what about games whose texts are written in the light of self-awareness? Is there a better place than postmodernism to stand and take in KPfS?</blockquote>Irony only gets you one pomo point, dude. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Consider: both kpfs and Sorcerer are responses to and challenges against "modern" game design as exemplified by Vampire.  However, whereas Sorcerer is in many respects a reactionary response ("this is how you do a real story, as told by this playwright from the 40s"), you are right that kpfs is an ironic recontextualization of Vampire's setting and system.  Now, <em>I have not played</em>, but from what AP reports I have read, play still tends to progress as a linear and straightforward character drama, challenging nothing especially.  The <em>book</em> is built out of irony, but I do not get the sense that <em>play</em> can claim the same.<br/><br/>Calling kpfs postmodern is like claiming <em>To the Lighthouse</em> is postmodern.  Certainly it is founded on a conscious distrust of what has come before, but that's a theme common to both modern and postmodern thought.  To get to postmodernism, you really need to break out of the structures of before by exploding assumptions, not just calling them out and giggling at them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234780/#Comment_234780" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T19:42:55+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  7:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Josh">@Josh</a>: it's been a while, but my experience with kpfs is neither straightforward nor linear.

The structuralists claim that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. Hence, they say that everything that is written seems to be governed by specific rules, a "grammar of literature"[4], that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked. A potential problem of structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive, as scholar Catherine Belsey puts it, "the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference"[5]. An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of West Side Story did not write anything "really" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a "formula" with a symbolic operator between them would be "Boy + Girl") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other ("Boy's Group - Girl's Group" or "Opposing forces") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings best focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two friendly families ("Boy's Family + Girl's Family") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other ("Boy - Girl") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.<br/></i><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a>: no damn clue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234794/#Comment_234794" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T21:40:01+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  9:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Irony only gets you one pomo point, dude. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></blockquote> The first one counts the most, though!<br/><br/>Seriously, though. As I see it the core element of postmodernism is self-awareness, where the work engages with the world <i>as a work</i>. It knows what it is, it knows that critics are out there talking about it, it knows that theorists are hard at work fitting it into their aesthetic explanations, and it goes meta to deal with those things. Irony is one possible manifestation, maybe the least subtle, along with fourth-wall games. But intertextuality, formal experimentation, in-world literary theorizing, writing to a theoretical end, all of these things are of postmodernism. A postmodernism, at least. You have expectations. The work will play with those expectations, and acknowledge that that's what it's doing. It will show you the fuzzy boundary, the tangled hierarchy. It's postmodern.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234796/#Comment_234796" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T21:48:20+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  9:48PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Pettersson</cite>If I make a game that conatins rules designed to give postmodern play, and which do it consistently ... did I just write a structuralist game?</blockquote> I would argue that if you wrote a game with rules designed to create structuralist play, and did it by establishing some story-skeleton (which you point out), and then by asking how you'd like to implement its substructures (naming them, making the assumption inescapable)... and if you got a story that could be neatly explained each time by reference to those assumptions... and <i>especially</i> if the analysis in those terms were part of the game... then you'd have written a postmodern game, in the terms of structuralist theory.
