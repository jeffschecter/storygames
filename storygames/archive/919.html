<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/fairplay/2006/07/06/gr-images/" rel="nofollow">Children fighting a war</a>.  That's what my game is about and it is more than a little unsettling to think about the implications.  I'm very serious about respecting the ground truth, and that means that the teenager you are playing may fall in love, but she may also die and/or go crazy and have everything she holds dear smashed before her eyes.  That last bit is, in fact, nearly certain.  So that's a little creepy, and it gets creepier when I work on the game and push it in directions that will make it <em>more fun to play</em>.  I'm addressing what amounts to recent history, and Grey Ranks could conceivably be seen and read by people who dodged mortar rounds in Warsaw.  It will certainly be seen by their grandchildren.  I find myself pondering the ethics of my endeavor, and I wonder where hard lines need to be drawn regarding content and presentation.  <br/><br/>As a designer, how much should I worry about my game causing harm?  How do I balance respect for the intrinsic horror of the subject matter and the fact that it is a <em>game</em>, to be <em>enjoyed</em> on some level?  What do you think?  Have you seen games that address (or fail to address) real tragedy, or real brutality, in a responsible way?                </div>

                            First off, Jason, what <em>harm</em> do you see your game as capable of inflicting?  I'm really asking; I'd like to hear your answer.<br/><br/>Secondly, from what I've seen, you're approaching the whole affair with what I'd expect in terms of respect -- you've taken a pretty solid take on the situation, designed to replicate it, and done so without making egregious changes to the historical record.  If you were making a movie about the Warsaw Uprising, you'd do pretty much the same thing.  It's an experiment on what can be explored and expressed, using real history -- live ammo -- as the content.  Can it blow up in your face, or the players' faces?  Sure.  So can Dogs, Sorcerer, or freakin D&amp;D.  What's important is how you approached the project from the start, and what you intended to find out in the experiment.  Your intentions are pure, as it were, and you're being careful.  What more can be asked of you or any game designer?  That we never make any game about sensitive material?  Obviously not.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, FLFS addresses imperialism and women's issues using long-range waldoes to obscure the fact that that's what it's doing.  I thought a lot along similar lines as you are now.                        </div>

                            Jason -- if I read you right, your ethical concerns stem from a desire to adequately respect the real people whose lives your writing represents.  I think there are two questions that pop out from that concern (that is, I see you asking two different questions at the same time):  Â First, is it respectful to make a <i>game</i> about this <i>at all</i>?  And second, is <i>my game</i> sufficiently respectful of their lived experience?<br/><br/>The answer to the first question you will have to grapple with in order to be comfortable with the answer; one could argue that by representing that experience as "art" (i.e., in a fictionalized form), you are in fact doing something admirable, raising our awareness and knowledge of an experience that no one playing the game would otherwise encounter.  In that vein, <i>Grey Ranks</i> is more respectful and let' s say <i>humane</i> than, say, another infantile fantasy game.<br/><br/>The answer to the second question will depend on the criteria that you adopt:  what does it mean to adequately or respectfully represent the experience of human beings under <i>any</i> conditions, when you are not a member of the group you're trying to represent?  Humanistic and qualititative social science researchers deal with this question when they do "ethnographic" studies of other cultures.  One technique that's been used has been to present the writing to a member of the culture (or their representative) and solicit their comments and feedback, incorporating them to the extent possible in the final write-up.  That may not be practicable in this case, but it may be enough for you to imagine a survivor of the war, now 90 years old, watching you play the game with your friends.  What do you expect his or her reaction would be?  It might be <i>gratitude</i>; you never know.                        </div>

<br/>
You're talking about how much reverence you should give your source material.  The answer is simple: As much reverence as you, the artist, want to give it.  No material -- none! -- is worth any reverence intrinsically.  An irreverent take is as valid as a reverent one.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that's the real issue.  I think that the real issue is twofold.<br/>
<br/>
1) You are asking for permission.  We can't give it to you.<br/>
<br/>
2) You are concerned about your game in other peoples' hands.  Will they be properly reverent?  In addition to the basic point, above, you as a game designer are not morally responsible for the content of the games played by others.  They take a responsibility to that content as well.<br/>
<br/>
People *will* do their own thing with your game and they will ineveitably use it for art that you would find abhorrent.  If this is unacceptable to you I suggest you not design the game.<br/>

As someone who wrote very bitter letters of complaint to the creators of <i>d20 Afghanistan</i>, I can only answer for myself: There are plenty of WWII games out there.  Craploads.  A good many of them don't address real tragedy *at all*, let alone in a responsible way.<br/><br/>Simply asking yourself the question puts you two legs and one buttcheek above the crowd.<br/><br/>It's like the old chestnut from GI Joe: Knowing is half the battle.  If you know that you should treat this with some reverence, you're far less likely to fail on many levels than someone who never even gives it a first thought.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  It seems like a balancing act:<br/>
One side has the idea of raising awareness of an issue that may not have been explored very well in the public cosciousness. On this side ANY treatment of the subject is beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
But, on the other side is the notion or idea that you might profit from human misery... There are ways to mitigate this of course, free distribution, donating a portion of profits or even endorsement from support/survivor groups/individuals. Honestly, I don't think you are motivated by profit, nor do you seem to be exploiting this event. But of course, only you can answer that question with any certainty...<br/>
<br/>
  I think the fact that teens are involved is a non-issue since its more  or less historically accurate. I think the fact that serious issues of the human condition are involved is also a  non-issue. That is the core of a good story and, thus, a good story game. The fact that it is based  on a specific instance of the human condition is a tenuous place to be, but it can be very rewarding if it is done well.<br/>
<br/>
  The only issue that you might want to consider is portraying anyone particular nationality or ethnic group in a stereotypical light, you know?<br/>

                            Hey Jason,<br/><br/>I've been asking myself the exact same questions for Carry. At one point I seriously considered dropping the game, because I didn't feel that it was appropriate for me, a young adult who has no experience, direct or indirect, with war of any kind, to approach the subject of Vietnam.<br/><br/>Then I realized that my fear was not for others, but for myself. I wasn't worried about the appropriateness, I was worried that I would get an email from an angry veteran lambasting me for my lack of respect. And you know what? I can live with that. Because its a fucking awesome game.<br/><br/>Not to say that this is what you're feeling, but it's how I answered those questions.                        </div>

                            Thanks, everybody - this is really encouraging and thought provoking.  <br/><br/>Joshua BishopLester, I think about harm in the same way that, say, a Mormon might be hurt by Dogs.  You're right that any game can be hurtful, but some have the potential to be more hurtful than others.  I think it is easy to add layers of distance to, say, a "Saving Private Ryan" narrative, even though it is horrible and about young people in war, because we have rich media buffers and can be selective about interpretation.  Grey Ranks can't really provide that safety, I don't think, by design.  Which is either awesome or horrible.<br/><br/>Bill, the ethnography example is a good one.  There are Poles (Polish gamers, anyway) looking at this project, hopefully with a critical eye.<br/><br/>Ben, obviously I can't control how someone interprets my work.  I do find myself designing with the goal of enforcing modes of play that won't encourage interpretations I personally dislike - do you think this is a mistake, either ethically or design-wise?<br/><br/>Dave, there's no stereotyping in Grey Ranks, not even of the bad guys (there is a little editorializing in particular cases, though - I do enjoy the freedom call attention to the fact that Oskar Dirlewanger was a sadistic pervert, for example).  I discuss the 1943 ghetto uprising and the fate of Warsaw's Jews, and offer the option of playing a Jewish partisan, but I make it very clear that it isn't what the game is about.<br/><br/>Nathan, we're absolutely in the same boat, and you're right - I'm afraid I'll have that confrontation, and I need to get over myself.  The work will either stand on its own or I'll be making a shameful atrocity that deserves contempt.  The former, hopefully (grin)<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestion, Guy.  I hadn't heard of that and can't imagine - I'll have to look it up.  <br/><br/>To expand the conversation a little bit, are there subjects that should be morally or ethically off limits to game designers?  I'm guessing Ben will say no...                        </div>

                            All games try to push into certain directions and modes of play, that's why we can do court intrigue in Werewolf and hack-and-slash in Vampire we tend not to. So from a game-design standpoint it's ok.<br/><br/>Another suggestion, on how NOT to do it, is World of Darkness: Gypsies, you can also search for the flamewars that one brought up. You should find both it and Shoah on Drivethrurpg.com                        </div>

Not ... as ... such.  I'm split on the subject because I (a) believe strongly that all speech should be free but (b) I'd really like to tell somepeople to shut the fuck up.<br/><br/>Take the Pimp card game by White Wolf.  Ethically speaking, there's no way that I could design a game like that, even if it were a 'send up' or parody.  Do I believe that no one should be 'allowed' to design a game like that?  No - but then again, I'm not just going to sit on my hands if you're a royal jackass, either.  I think that there's a lot of room for harm - not to people, but to the image of gaming - to be done by stupid game companies (I'm looking at YOU, Kuma|WAR, Rockstar and White Wolf), which does nothing to promote what I believe are the overall benefits of a steady diet of good games.                        </div>

                            How about a game where you play a pedophile?  A game that challenges you to explore your character's illness, treatment, and recovery.  I understand the value of free expression, so is this a game that anyone can write but no one will play?<br/><br/>I'm just poking the notion of ethical boundaries with a stick.                        </div>

To expand the conversation a little bit, are there subjects that should be morally or ethically off limits to game designers?  I'm guessing Ben will say no...<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, trying to draw a line and say "people shouldn't be able to do this" is an unpopular and possibly stupid thing to say.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have personal views on what I'd like? Sure. I don't want to see:<br/>
<br/>
* Any games that make fun of anyone else for amusement, like Pimp: the Backhanding for a horrible example. (You know, I actually liked some WW games. I haven't bought one since.)<br/>
<br/>
* Any games where you gratuitously play bad people. Role-playing is dangerous territory. You want to explore evil to see where it comes from, go ahead. You want to play, say, serial killers for the thrill - I judge it as wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, I say go for it.                        </div>

                            Ethically off-limits...hmmm.  Okay, so starting with the presupposition that we are not talking about free speech (which outright lets you do things that may not be ethically sound), I would say it is less a matter of *what* gets presented than *how* it gets presented.<br/>
<br/>
Pedophile game--not necessarily unethical as you state it, just really icky.  Makes me physically uncomfortable, way past my threshold for what I could ever play in an rpg--but think, Law &amp; Order SVU did just that plot in a TV show, tossing on an added layer of moral complexity directed *at* the viewers, at the silent investments they make in the characters of the drama.  Edgy and perhaps *more* ethical than their average show.<br/>
<br/>
so why not unethical?  It retains the humanity and inhumanity, the gravity and the grace (to borrow a phrase from Simone Weil) that make up life.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the most dangerous, most potentially unethical, style of 'real life' rpg's is the effort to erase those two dimensions, to make it all about this heroic agency, to elide the way in which terrible circumstances 'take possession' of people, make them as much objects as subjects.  We don't like to see that, but I think there is something salutory in any endeavor that fosters reflection.  It's one thing to play  nice escapist rpg, tell heroic stories and all that, quite another to try and tell a 'true' story that 'teaches' its players that those heroic escapist tropes are how the real world works.                        </div>

                            Returning to the specific example of <em>Grey Ranks</em> for a moment, another aspect of the issue that concerns me is the game's position as a Bully Pulpit Games product.  We specifically intended to set up BPG to serve as a vehicle for any of the game ideas that moved us, but so far our products have been, essentially, dark comedies.  Does that set expectations that <em>Grey Ranks</em> will be the same kind of twisted humor?  Even if not, is that kind of serious game something that people will feel okay having fun with?  I think that's an important piece of Jason's question - can you expect someone to have fun playing a serious game like this, or would they just read it, nod their heads, and say "man, that's deep", and then go play <em>Bang</em> instead?                        </div>

                            (Segedy articulates a secret terror)<br/><br/>It'll have all the great arcs of human drama, love, tragedy, loss, redemption, the hero's journey, plus killing Nazis.  I think it will be fun to play in the same way that a very intense, HBO-style game of PTA can be fun, or a crazy serious game of sorcerer.  So yes, Grey Ranks won't be for everybody but I think play will be rewarding - that's my hope.<br/><br/>Anybody expecting a sequel to The Roach with zany partisan hijinx will be disappointed.

                            Jason,<br/><br/>Have you seen the Paranoia mission "Hunger"? It makes the PCs responsible for making a sector of Alpha Complex starve to death. There's cannabilism. It's <i>very</i> grim and <i>very</i> funny.<br/><br/>So, yes, I wanted to point out that you can deal with difficult topics without being reverent.<br/><br/>Similarly...although these aren't game examples...there's nothing wrong with dealing with issues like paedophilia. You can do it sensitively (as in the film "The Woodsman") or turn it into a comedy (as in the British TV series "Brass Eye").<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<i>Does that set expectations that Grey Ranks will be the same kind of twisted humor?</i><br/><br/>I suspect the answer to that is a yes, but a little yes.  I think as long as it gets advertised for what it is, folks will pick up pretty quickly on the difference.  The good news is that BPG is still pretty 'young'--you aren't typecast yet.<br/><br/><i> Even if not, is that kind of serious game something that people will feel okay having fun with? </i><br/><br/>This is a tougher question that I'm not entirely sure I'm qualified to answer.  That rarely stops me though, so here is a rudimentary response:<br/><br/>There seems to be a growing interest in more serious rpg's, as evinced by Matthjis' game focusing on the Holocaust, Nathan's game Carry, and Grey Ranks.  That is, admittedly, on the design end, but it seems that if we are seeing that kind of development in design that it might reflect an interest elsewhere, too.  We have seen some seriously gritty explorations of these topics in other popular mediums (film, tv, books).  People seem to get something meaningful from them.<br/><br/>That said, could I get my gaming group to play it?  It would be a hard sell--there is one guy who might totally go for it, but I suspect the rest of them would balk hard at the subject matter.  Of course, my gaming group is fairly mainstream, so may not be the best sample.<br/><br/>I'd be really curious to see what sort of response Nathan feels he has gotten in regards to Carry.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think it is easy to add layers of distance to, say, a "Saving Private Ryan" narrative, even though it is horrible and about young people in war, because we have rich media buffers and can be selective about interpretation.  Grey Ranks can't really provide that safety, I don't think, by design.  Which is either awesome or horrible.</blockquote>
Actually, Jason, one of the things that I value most in roleplaying is that ability to be "selective about interpretation."  Whereas most other media place a large, large portion of the interpretation-selection in the hands of the creator and only a little (comparatively) in the hands of the audience, in roleplaying where the participants are both creators and audience, they have a vast, almost unprecidented amount of interpretive power.  I'll point at PTA as a great example of something that allows a group of people to "make a television show" that would never actually see real airtime because it's about what the players care about and interprets what they care about in the ways that they see fit.  We can throw extreme examples out there (a group of furries on a space station!), but the potential is better served by more moderate examples such as a family drama exploring gender issues or a high school serial about class.  PTA can be a powerful tool to allow players to create powerful and deeply personal interpretations on just about anything.<br/><br/>So in the case of Grey Ranks, I see your project as something that will put a lot of power, authority, and permission in players' hands to explore a troubling piece of history.  Will some players play the game irreverently and perhaps "irresponsibly"?  Yes, invariably so.  But I suspect they're the minority, and what they do is their business, not yours.  You're producing a game that allows all your other players to do something incredible, and that's a good thing.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>To expand the conversation a little bit, are there subjects that should be morally or ethically off limits to game designers?  I'm guessing Ben will say no...</blockquote>
Off-limits to game designers in general?  No.  Off-limits to specific game-designers?  Probably.  I should not make a roleplaying game about American partisan politics, for instance, because it would be ideologically-biased partisan drek.  But that doesn't mean that somebody else with a better perspective than I've got couldn't make such a project sing.  So while every individual game designer has probably got a number of topics that he or she really isn't qualified to cover in a responsible or quality fashion, I don't think there's any topic out there that nobody could do.  I certainly don't think that the art form itself is incapable of handling any "tough" topics.                        </div>

Well.<br><br>I haven't gotten any <i>bad</i> responses. I've gotten feedback from playtesters ranging from awesomely positive to garbled. I got a call from the DexCon organizers asking me to run more sessions of the game b/c (and I quote from memory) "I feel like there will be a lot of interest for more off-beat but serious games like this." So that was encouraging. And I've received pre-orders for the game.<br><br>I'm a little nervous about the responses it'll get once it's released to the wild. But, Card-via-Tony pretty much nails it for me. If there wasn't the potential for harm (whatever that would entail), there wouldn't be the potential for AWESOME, either. Like Jason, I really, really want every game of Carry to be as intense and meaningful for everyone else as it is for me. But, like, people are people, ya'know?<br><br/>As for ethical boundaries for game design, I can't really imagine a topic that couldn't be handled seriously and with due respect, and in a meaningful fashion. Of course, I can't imagine a topic that couldn't be handled dismissively and with dick jokes. So....its more in execution, then in concept, for me.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

Do I think that there are issues that are handled poorly?  Yes.  Look at, say, Little Fears.<br/>
<br/>
Are there issues that I don't think that a role-playing game, as a medium, can handle appropriately?  Damned straight.  But these are concerns about limitations of the medium.  If they can be handled appropriately, they should be, and as we advance our game design technology, we're going to be able to handle a wider and wider range of topics well.  If I draw a line in the sand and say "this, gaming can never handle this" then, well, I'm setting myself up for being wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It could be that you don't have the ability to handle the material of Grey Ranks as well as you'd like to.  In that case, either develop your skills to the point where you can or drop the game.  You can do it or you can't, and you're in the best position to say which.<br/>
<br/>
You will publish this game or not, and face the moral consequences thereof (good or bad -- I think probably mostly good.)  No amount of fretting and hand-wringing beforehand will absolve a single bit of them.<br/>

P.S. I think it may be a mistake as a designer to prevent your players from making statements you consider abhorrent -- simply because that means that you are also crippling their ability to make statements that are powerful and meaningful.  See Card, via Tony, above.                        </div>
