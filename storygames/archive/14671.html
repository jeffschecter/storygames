Thanks to Magus for organising it, Graham for cat-herding, Indie Pete for the tea, cakes, and t-shirts, and all the attendees for some brilliant gaming.<br/><br/>The afternoon started with my first play of Microscope, which turned out to be as good as the best reports I've heard of it. The thing to watch is that the role-played Scenes require the players to bring a lot to the table. You have to play it a bit like Polaris and make bold statements and really push things. The system will rein in excess, but it won't bolster timidity. That took us a couple of scenes to realise, but once we did things went really well. <br/><br/>We envisaged the game as the rise and fall of an Athens-like city state. A few early statements quickly pushed in an unexpected direction that focused on religious rivalry and intolerance, and things added to the history later in the game made us look back at some of the earlier-played events in a whole new light. We ended up with a setting that was rich and evocative with plenty of scope for further exploration. The melding of four distinct visions meant that we ended up with something that none of us would have created on our own. <br/><br/>I also ended up winning a LIRMG t-shirt of a distinctly off-colour comment I made early in the game, which was nice.<br/><br/>Then we had a break for tea and some excellent cakes provided by the hosting pub. Enough to feed an army, but all really good.<br/><br/>The evening was me running a game of Dust Devils. We started with a quick lines-and-veils chat, but the veils were quickly torn down in play, as the PCs engaged in all sorts of acts that shouldn't be discussed in polite company. There was plenty of blood, sex, violence, and death. The finale was a blood-soaked shootout in the main street at high midnight followed by hangings all round. Nicely enough, the main NPC villain was taken out quite quickly in the game. <br/><br/>The situation description needs a few tweaks, mainly a few more Bangs, then I'll post it somewhere for all. <br/><br/>I can't comment too much on the other games, but most people seemed somewhere between content and enthused by the games. <br/><br/>A good day all round, and I'll be back again soon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
