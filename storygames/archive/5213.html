They're very different, and there are very different reasons why I like them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/the-father/" rel="nofollow">The Father</a> by Erlend Bruer is a slow move toward patricide. In the final scene, father is killed. It's a dark and open game, one which lets you use what you know about family dysfunction in ever new ways. And such dysfunction is the heart and core of so many stories... This one I love for the play experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/the-new-middle-ages/" rel="nofollow">The New Middle Ages</a> by Anders Nygaard is inspired by Umberto Eco's "Ten ways to dream about the middle ages". Each player represents one way the modern world views the middle ages, and the players' conflicting views are shown in their portrayal and narration. I'm thinking Borges readers will love this. I love it for the idea behind it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
