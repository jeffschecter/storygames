MACE goes down next Friday, so the week before we release the ingredients and the registrants cut loose for a week of totally unsupervised IGC game-building. It will probably be my last year doing this at the Con, it's a solid event but I don't find it as satisfying as the communal feedback aspects of the regular Game Chef yearly event online.<br/><br/>Anyway, this year we decided to make it totally open to interpretation of game: RPGs are standard, but card/board games are kosher, too.  I figure it might be hard to judge an RPG on the same plane as a card game... but on the other hand, there are usually only 3-4 submissions each year, so I don't see too much of a big problem with it.<br/><br/>Here was the ingredients. I decided to go back to the Rules and Themes split, which always is fun. And you'll probably notice that the rules are a lot less constraining than normal: Basically, we "LITE" up the Mace event because most of the folks participating have never done this kind of thing before, and figure we'd start off people on a brisk mental/creativity jog rather than a marathon.<br/><br/>Anyway, no one here is going to MACE so you can't participate, but just wanted to share in case they inspire:<br/><br/>================================================================================<br/><br/>CONSTRAINT ONE: THE RULES<br/><br/>You must choose two of the following rules constraints in your game:<br/><br/>1) The game must make use of (either actually or metaphorically) the classic Tarot deck.<br/><br/>2) The game must be scalable/playable from three people up to fifteen people.<br/><br/>3) The game must have some sort of internet or online component.<br/><br/>4) You must write sentences as part of the game.<br/><br/>5) The game must use no randomizers like dice or playing cards.<br/><br/><br/>CONSTRAINT TWO: THE THEME<br/><br/>Your game must include two of the following themes somewhere in your game. The greater the prominence/importance of the theme word, the higher the game will score:<br/><br/>1) Korea<br/><br/>2) Highway<br/><br/>3) Axe<br/><br/>4) Ceramic<br/><br/>5) River<br/><br/>==============================================================<br/><br/>Again, this was for a local closed event, but hey if they inspire someone here (who isn't already participating in one of the three concurrent S-G game/design contests currently happening), go for it. I'll give you a gold star.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107529/#Comment_107529" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T10:26:04+00:00" title="November  9, 2007 10:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I look forward to seeing how people incorporate internet/online play.

(Of course, you could interpret that constraint to disallow items that <em>could</em> be used as randomizers, but that would be rather problematical, since so many things could be if you put your mind to it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
