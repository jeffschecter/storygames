Do you think they would make for an interesting group? Would you make any changes? (I know the diversity is low, but I was limited on the art I could use for commercially reproducing minors).<br/><br/>     What do you think of the mansion itself? Does it feel like a mixture of wonder and nightmare?<br/><br/>     What do you think about the information provided in the Module? Is too little defined for the GM? Are the clues helpful? What else would you add?<br/><br/>I wrote some additional content that had to be edited out, and I am considering releasing it on the website as supplemental material. This would include more sample encounters, and alternate characters. Is this something you think other GMs would want to read?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386082/#Comment_386082" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T15:40:22+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  3:40PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My theory with clues is they should come in two varieties - mandatory ones (in that they are given to the characters at appropriate times) that explain thw <i>what </i>of things, so that moving forward doesnt depend on finding a clue, solving a puzzle or the player making a deduction.  So they should not be ambiguous.<br/><br/>The other varety is optional - these explain the <i>why </i> of the situation.  These give the aha! moment, but the characters are not guarenteed to get them, and they are free to make their own deductions from them.  they can be ambiguous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
