Which made me think about how I don't play many games that use a lot of dice. Which made me think about when I do play games with a lot of dice, I often encounter the "dice monster" side of roleplayers.<br/><br/>Sure, it can be entertainingly fetishistic with a lace bag for the ladies, the "+2 Bag of Holding" for con geeks, or the John Harper "this looks like an electrician's leather tool holder except that it's full of 500 dice" bag.<br/><br/>That I can deal with. But I don't bring many dice with me to games, and in fact I just don't own very many. So why do people treat me so strangely when I ask to borrow some dice? No one cares about lending me a pencil or maybe even a game book. But ask if I can borrow one (of their fifteen) d20 and I get a look from them like I want to take their little boy into my basement for a few hours.<br/><br/>What's the deal?

That's a lot for Dogs, but putting them in four bowls in the middle is a subtle tactile reminder of community, and avoids players mixing their dice with each other and then having to sort them out at the end.  Players may have a ton of d6's and d10's, but it's a rare player that brings his own 22d4 when that's needed for fallout, and rolling dice in batches is slow and annoying.  I think I got into the habit when I ran Feng Shui at conventions, and rather than remember which color players were claiming were high and which low *this* time, I handed everyone one red and one white d6 saying "Just as all action in the world is a balance of positive and negative furies, so too these dice represent positive (red) and negative (white)."<br/><br/>In an ongoing campaign I might expect players to come prepared, but since I mostly run demo games for people who haven't played before, I wouldn't expect them to have to know what dice to bring and how many.  It's much easier for me to provide 12 white, 24 black, and 32 red dice for <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em> than to expect every player to bring 3, 6, and 8 of the right color.  (Or twice that, because some other player doesn't have dice!)<br/><br/>I couldn't say what's up with John Harper's Bag o' 500 dice.  Maybe he used to play Champions.<br/><br/>As for dice superstition, the cheap dice sold for RPGs are often badly balanced; if you want to check you can do a simple chi-square test although it takes a lot of rolling.  But more likely, it's just the enormously powerful human pattern recognition misfiring, or intermingling with the huge amount of the human brain devoted to noticing other people's moods being applied to  anthropomorphize things like cars or cats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176189/#Comment_176189" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T04:03:15+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  4:03AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running games at few cons for a handfull of years and early on I noticed that players over here (Sweden) tend not to come equipped.

If I'd had any winner instinct I'd probably see this as a big problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176197/#Comment_176197" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T06:55:28+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  6:55AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magical thinking about dice drives me up a fucking wall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176198/#Comment_176198" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T07:10:20+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  7:10AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't believe in dice voodoo, but I really like my dice.

Pot, meet kettle (don't call him BLACK!).<br/><br/>Second, I loan dice... but often begrudgingly. At a con, demoing--sure, no problem, yeah DitV DOES use a shitload, huh? But sitting down at a scheduled game with fellow middle class adults... IN A GAMING STORE... well, I will give funny looks as I pass them over, glancing significantly at the rack of 500 dice sets, in all colors and sizes.<br/><br/>Why do I care? I dunno. With introspection, it's a combination of things. As above, if I can take the time and the $10 to be prepared, why not others? Further, if I have just enough to easily play, then loaning starts to increase handling time as I have to ferret out the dice I need from those to whom I loaned them. Also, frankly... folks don't treat them right. I roll a die off the table MAYBE once every decade; but I loan them for one session, and you can bet we're peering under the table, trying not to crunch or (further) scratch the errant-rolled die. Finally, I have a paranoia that one will be lost or rolled under furniture too heavy or cluttered to easily move... and be abandoned. Or just plain lost, never to be found.<br/><br/>In closing, one thing to recognize is that dice are inherently ablative--they destroy themselves over time. Yet no one ever offers me, say, a soda or 5 cents, to offset the deterioration they will cause by using my dice. Now, that takes years and years to matter... but, hey, it's a cost and why should I bear it alone, in my group, just because I was the only Boy Scout ("Be Prepared")?<br/><br/>(For the record: I have similar feelings about loaning out one of my two pencils or dry-erase markers--it's really more the principle of the thing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176204/#Comment_176204" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T08:55:15+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  8:55AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, since you asked, and since I'll be there, I actually prefer that all the dice belong clearly to one person, and that everyone uses those.<br/><br/>It's simple economics for me.

The same holds for pens and character sheets and whatnot: when I GM, I provide whatever tools are needed to play. A part of that might be the fact that nowadays I do a huge amount of demoing games to all sorts of audiences, so I tend to think like a boy scout when it comes to facilitating a session, whether I'm playing with an ostensible prepared group or newbies doing their first rpg ever. The primary reason, though, is that dice are just tools of play, so insisting on using your own because you like how they look like comes off as annoyingly... insane? Anyway, not really focused on the task at hand, which is playing the damn game. Doing some sort of dice juju on the side makes it seem like you're really playing some sort of dice-tamagotchi instead of this game here with us.<br/><br/>As for hating dice fetishism... I don't think I have any strong feelings, but I do get mildly annoyed by all sorts of wacky irrational shit when people display it proudly as some sort of status badges. I've never met a Finn who tried that dice religion stuff on me without it being some sort of "geekier than thou" thing - perhaps they learned it off the Internet? So believe what you will, but please don't make a big deal of it at the game table if at all possible. And don't take up how you've been playing or watching anime for the last 40 hours either like it was some sort of achievement, that's another annoying thing these teenage nerds here try to one-up each other about. Nothing to make me certain that you'll be useless for the game like boasting about your special dice and about how you didn't sleep last night because you had so much fun playing something else.<br/><br/>I've also never managed to ablate dice by rolling them. I'm probably not playing enough; must be because of that sleeping thing.<br/><br/>(This message has been decorated with emphasis for comedic purposes.

That was not always the case (Red Box D&amp;D, anyone?), and some dice are sturdier than others even today. Also, not all floors are carpeted, and a die can get pretty much ruined with one nasty bounce off concrete or marble or tile. We have to replace the bar dice at James Joyce about twice a year (four foot falls to slate can make a die look like it's from ancient Rome).<br/><br/>And while we're on the subject, no one's mentioned stone, bone, or precious metal dice. Given the damage and loss risk, would the fetish-haters still hold the same view of someone who won't share them? How about (as Logos suggests) the dice you got for your first anniversary, or inherited from a departed relative or friend. Yeah, I'm pushing it to 11, here, but maybe considering an extreme will make the less extreme sense of protectiveness or fetish behaviors more understandable. Value, after all, is subjective and elastic.<br/><br/>Just some grist for the mill. I, too, can live out my days happily, regardless of what others think of my dice proclivities.<br/><br/>(That reminds me...

Especially for any game where lots of dice are likely to be flying around the table constantly. Dogs sticks out as an example here, as when you've got 4 or 5 Dogs and a passel of NPCs all shoving dice everywhere, the whole table ends up covered in dice and keeping them all separate is a pain. So these days I usually just haul out the bag o doom and have everyone use my dice. (Which may be where John's bag o doom comes from -- making sure he has enough dice to play any game he wants with whoever he wants, regardless of whether or not they have dice of their own.) <br/><br/>There are a few dice I'm actually kinda protective about, but not because of magical thinking. I've got a 29(ish) year old d20 that is all that remains of the dice that came with my first D&amp;D box. It's only barely a d20 anymore, as all the corners are well rubbed down and its practically a sphere. That dice has some sentimental value, and is suffering from age, so I don't normally use it -- and if I do, I may give someone else who asks to use it a stink eye. (Still give it over, sure, but not without delicately suggesting that they suck and are leach who is unwilling to bring either chips or dice to game when they know they need both, and is thus just a drain on the bonds of human decency and friendship.) I also have some rather expensive dice that Mo go me for my birthday years back, and I'm often careful with them. I let other people roll them, sure, but I'm always pretty careful to make sure that I get them back at the end of the game. (These are the dice that got lost at Nerdly, and returned by Remi, who is cool.) <br/><br/>Really, I guess this is all just to say I treat dice like I treat a lot of things. My game books, for example. I take care of them, make sure to bring them to game, sometimes get irked when I'm the only one in the group who ever brings books, or when someone is eating nacho cheese Doritos and then gets fingerprints in orange all over my signed copy of Jame Bond... Dice are things, but they're also things we need for game, and things that I brought and would like to have respected. <br/><br/>So yea, dice fetishism is funny. But I also find dice iconoclasm to be equally funny. Taking something like who likes to do what with dice at the table and turning it into a moral point is, well...

By that I mean, for me, particular dice add to the atmosphere at the table.  If I'm rolling my copper d20 as opposed to a plain, blah-colored plastic die, it feels more significant (especially if we're in a steampunk or S-F setting).  If I'm in a fantasy game, the rune-sprinkled dice feel thematically cooler.  When I played Wushu Exalted, I used these awesome red Scarab dice from Chessex for Scarlet dice and plain black dice for Ebon.  Those colors and names in themselves reinforced the flavor of the setting at the table for me.  Sometimes I might associate a particular die as representative of my character (frex, satin red and purple die for a magus, a copper die for a Gloranthan Aldryami), in which case I might be reluctant to lend out that particular die if that character is in play.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go so far as to call my particular practice fetishistic or a form of cathexis, but it does qualify as a quirk.  Dice are  the most tangible and universal "tools" we bring to the game, so I'm not surprised when gamers form an attachment to their favorites.<br/><br/>OK, though, the microwave punishment story...that's out of the box, shithouse weird.  I'd put them in rock salt to disperse the negative energy.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176236/#Comment_176236" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T12:03:39+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 12:03PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Quite simply, folks who cannot be bothered to come to the table prepared with a full set of dice are less intelligent and less socially able than others.

Combine that with the dice security rules of the casino that try to prevent cheating, and you get a dynamic tension of social forces around the handling of the dice that makes anything RPG players do seem normal by comparison.<br><br>OK, except setting fire to low-rolling dice.

Call it crazy, but people do this with their cars, their clothes, and their dice. They project a bit of themselves into their things.

It wasn't.<br/><br/>That said, the loaners seem to disparage the non-loaners (let's table the con/demo thing with DitV and such--anyone on their game as a demoer does this routinely) while the non-loaners are forced to apologize or build cases based on deprivation or scarcity or preparedness.<br/><br/>I just say that's lame, is all.

                       One word...<br/>\n<br/>\nMoJo<br/>\n<br/>\nDice can become almost a fetish to some gamers. When you spend years rolling the same dice you put a bit of your heart and soul into each roll hoping that it will turn out exactly the way you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you hand it to someone and they put their mojo on it attempting to get it to roll what they want. When you attempt to use your mind to cause a specific roll many different times on the same dice there is a bit of magic if you ask me. In a game it would be like handing over your +3 sword to someone who wants to open a lock. At this point you pray your GM doesn't roll something low causing it to break.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou put all that effort into rolling the perfect roll and getting your mojo onto the thing and then you lend it and it never rolls the same. I know they are just plastic or stone or metal but there is an attachment that people develop towards inanimate objects and this is very true with dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice for the gamers who love their specific dice is to always bring extras that can be lent out so that your mojo stays true. But then again I sell dice so what would I know. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nGMDice                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176837/#Comment_176837" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T18:23:52+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  6:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2008 6:26PM by Tristan.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that dice rituals, taboos and superstitions are fun. Yes, they are. There is something "communal" about "warming" the dice before rolling them. Everyone does it. And sometimes one even stares intently as the other player is about to roll them. That builds a lot more tension than just rolling them as if...<br><br>And the personalization stuff resonates with me too. You can look at their dice and you know all the players are different. Their dice are different, and so are their gaming style and practices.<br><br>Of course, there are some creeps...<br><br>In my gaming groups there is a common funny ritual. The GM provides most of the dice. They are all together in the same bag. Yet everyone has his favorites. So every time we play there is this little ritual of setting "my" dice and miniature apart from the rest.<br><br>Sometimes people do buy their dice, but most of the time they simply leave them at the GM's bag, so they are all together so we can use them next time. And there is a little "Hey! Those are my dice", but we all pretty much lend them without much thought. Except for this one friend, who was of the "DO NOT DARE TOUCHING MY DICE, YOU CREEP!!!!!" Ew.<br><br>Personally, I just don't feel comfortable enough if I'm not using my own dice. I say it has more to do with my (slight) O/C disorder than about superstition. I have no problem in letting other people using my dice, as long as they pass them over to me for my next roll.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176912/#Comment_176912" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T12:38:41+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 12:38PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a tradition, back in the day, that putting someone else's dice in your mouth curses them (takes away their mojo).<br><br>Also it was gross.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7967/why-are-gamers-so-anal-about-their-dice" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7967/why-are-gamers-so-anal-about-their-dice" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7967/why-are-gamers-so-anal-about-their-dice/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7967%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7967%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
