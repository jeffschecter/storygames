That's got me thinking again about fun cycles in games, and how many laughs (or really, moments of fun) we get per hour of gaming. <br/><br/>Obviously trying to measure fun is tricky- is it laughs? Smiles? Tears of delight at a deeply satisfying moment in the story? It will vary from game to game and person to person, but I think there's a threshold that each of us has in their head for what is enough and what isn't.<br/><br/>Jason has talked before about how <i>Fiasco</i>'s design came from wanting to fit as much fun as possible in a 2 hour session, because that's what our weekly game allows. The FPH is high  for us with that game, although maybe not as high for somebody who doesn't get or like the game. For myself, I thought the FPH for <i>Grey Ranks</i> was pretty high (again, not so much laughter as moments of satisfaction with the story). At the same time, the game is designed to be played over three sessions and I think players often cut it down to one to pack more fun into fewer hours.<br/><br/>I think something else that sparked this thought was reading Jenskot's <a href="http://goo.gl/RBXSd" rel="nofollow">awesome play-by-play</a> (not sure if that's a public post or not) of his experience with the <a href="http://lizziestark.com/2012/07/26/mad-about-the-boy-sign-up/" rel="nofollow"><i>Mad About the Boy</i> LARP</a> this weekend. It sounds like an amazing experience, but what struck me is that he spent 18+ hours waiting and doing lonely-fun so that he could play very intensely for 2 hours. There's still a lot of debriefing happening, but that seems like a crazy-low FPH ratio to me.<br/><br/>So what about you? What's your Fun-Per-Hour ratio? What is something measurable that you can count as "fun" in a game, and at one point are you disappointed in a game when you're not getting enough of it? How quickly do you know that you're not getting it?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392713/#Comment_392713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T10:11:37+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 10:11AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally wouldn't use those terms for a measure, but there is certainly a threshold for when I find something rewarding enough to want to do again.  <br/><br/><br/>It does make a big difference if I feel like I am doing things for others' fun, as well.  I often spend lots of time on game design and preparation.  I felt this keenly at one point this weekend at Big Bad Con.  I was sitting in the hallway for about an hour working on character sheets for the 1001 Nights that I had signed up to run in the afternoon, while lots of people were passing by or in nearby rooms playing in games and/or socializing.  However, I felt like there was a definite payoff when I ran it.  (Likewise, I have nagging guilt that I need to start preparing more for what I'm running at AmberCon NorthWest next month.)  <br/><br/>I think people often have different thresholds depending on their expectations.  For example, someone might consider it OK to put in a lot of work-like hours preparing something if they considered it "game design", but not be OK with that if they thought of it as "game prep".                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392714/#Comment_392714" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T10:15:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 10:15AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tricky question how to measure it. Fun should be in the game all the time if possible. But what could be counted are climaxes of fun or something like that. I like to have at least one "shit just got real" moment in games that are about suspense but I usually notice at the end of the session if it did not run well. Percentage of time spend talking in character could be a measurement or percentage of the time spend actually playing instead of table chatter.

When I play volleyball or ping pong, I would say I am having fun nearly all the time.

In fact, it seems unlikely: when you play many games (Mass Effect, football, Monopoly), you spend very little time actually <i>having fun</i>.<br/><br/>I don't think my games would be better if they had more fun in them.</blockquote>\nThis reminds me of the following passage from Ian Bogost's <i>Unit Operations: An Approach to Videogame Criticism</i> (p118-119), in which he critiques the notion that "fun" is the only or primary metric for gameplay experiences.\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, [Ralph] Koster\u2019s reliance on fun as a first principle for games forces him into a corner. On the one hand, he makes a convincing call for games that fulfill goals beyond mere entertainment. This call is especially constructive given Koster\u2019s relative celebrity in the game design community. On the other hand, he argues that the effect games produce in their players\u2014all games, and all players\u2014is \u201cfun.\u201d This reliance on a single output for games contradicts his earlier, apparently reproachful observation that a singular expressive goal limits the medium. The reliance on fun poses a conceptual problem for Koster, who must retrofit the revolutionary potential of games to mate properly with the concept of fun that serves as his engine. Anticipating possible objections to games that go beyond fun in the usual and popular sense, Koster finds himself attributing a wide array of possible responses to the realm of the fun. \u201cOne of the commonest points I hear about why videogames are not an art form,\u201d says Koster, \u201cis that they are just for fun. They are just entertainment. Hopefully I\u2019ve made it clear why that is a dangerous underestimation of fun.\u201d This moment marks Koster\u2019s inversion of games and their expressive output; here fun becomes the primary term, with videogame-based expression enslaved to it. Koster admits that \u201cwe may be running into definitional questions for the word \u2018fun\u2019 here,\u201d but he prefers a \u201cformalist perspective to actually arrive at the basic building blocks of the medium.\u201d Like Benjamin, Koster hopes to open a space be- tween uncritical enjoyment and antagonistic critique. Despite these intentions, Koster is hard pressed to avoid the rhetoric of fun as the superficial conveyance of capital so often associated with the entertainment industry, the goal that Benjamin foresees and Postman critiques.<br/><br/>Koster\u2019s understanding of fun decouples the outcome of gameplay from pleasure in the ordinary sense, enabling other kinds of responses. But in the same gesture Koster insists that these outcomes still entail fun, albeit fun of a different kind. We might call Koster\u2019s alternate fun <i>fun'</i> (fun prime), a kind of alternatereality fun that entails the social, political, and even revolutionary critique that Benjamin first envisioned for mechanically reproducible art. Despite this conceptual similarity, Koster\u2019s insistence on grouping meaningful responses of any kind under the rubric of \u201cfun\u201d is simply perverse. One need go no further than everyday experience to recognize how absurd the notion of fun' is: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when I walked in on her and Jim. I know our relationship has been mostly fun' lately, but I didn\u2019t realize it was over.\u201d Or: \u201cI heard Mary\u2019s husband had another heart attack. And so soon after her mother died . . . they\u2019ve really been going through a lot of fun' this year.\u201d Chris Crawford recognizes this limitation and observes its inappropriateness as a measure for the impact of a videogame. \u201cFun,\u201d observes Crawford, \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite fit the adult\u2019s experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<br/>All that said, though, I would personally say that fun, narrowly defined as delight, enjoyment, social pleasure, whatever, is a big part of why I play RPGs and what I get out of them, regardless of what other dynamics are at play (intellectual satisfaction, fictional engagement, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392732/#Comment_392732" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T12:21:48+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 12:21PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2012 12:22PM by w176.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we skip the fun part and call it "Rewarding experience per hour".<br/><br/>Then I'm the sort of player that can invest a lot of time with low REPH, if I know there will be a great payoff as a result of it.

I like my friends, they're funny and smart and together we can have a great time with a lot of games. Sitting down at the table with them is honestly one of the highlights of my week, damn near every week of the year. I don't know what that breaks down to in per-minute terms (because what kind of person could even guess at a number like that?), but in terms of "rewarding enough to do again," it does very well.<br/><br/>But if you took my friends out of that equation, then you'd be taking out the one thing that I can't get from any of the many other rewarding activities available to me, and gaming by itself probably wouldn't meet my reward threshold. Or more accurately, it would be one of the last options on a very long list of other stuff I could be doing with my time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392757/#Comment_392757" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T14:19:49+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  2:19PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I see gaming as a craft or an art.

Two? Ten?"<br/><br/>If you take the comedy tv series analogy, realize that the laugh moments don't work without the setup. If it takes a few minutes to set up a little laugh and ten minutes, maybe the entire episode, to set up a big laugh, that's all time you need to get to the fun. Furthermore, if you're not entirely engaged with those trans-laugh periods, it's likely the laugh moments won't have any punch.<br/><br/>Gaming is similar. The best you can shoot for is fulltime engagement by the players. If they're willingly engaged with the game, they're probably having lots of fun. If they're sleeping between combat rounds, taking frequent smoke breaks while other people role-play, or talking amongst themselves about non-game stuff, they're not engaged and they're probably not having fun doing the gaming thing. They might be having fun doing the social thing.<br/><br/>I shoot for 100% engagement. All my friends at the table, engaged with the game, all the time.

But I digress....<br/>-----<br/>Steve, when you get back to the thread: I suggest looking into the term "engagement" as applied to current management/human resources theory. It's principle elements:<br/>* Out of a huge set of potentially engaging elements of <del>work</del>play, each <del>employee</del>player has several priorities unique to them.<br/>* A <del>company</del>game can only address a finite number of priorities.<br/>* When most/all priorities are mostly/highly satisfied, <del>employees</del>players stick around and report high satisfaction.<br/><br/>A game can only directly reinforce a subset of play priorities, can encourage some other subset through play advice and guidance, but can't do a damned thing about other elements of play.<br/>-----<br/>I'd argue that LARP is sufficiently different from TT RPGs that any attempt at comparison decays rapidly, ESPECIALLY a rate-based comparison metric (i.e., one using time as divisor).<br/><br/>So "FPH" for LARP has to deal with BOTH the issue that "fun/engagement" is hard to calculate objectively AND that rate-based metrics are unparallel between TT and LARP.<br/><br/>For that reason, I'd suggest folks stick to TT (or I'd suggest that Steve ask folks to stick to TT, if y'all don't believe me and he does). :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392873/#Comment_392873" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T10:52:18+00:00" title="October  9, 2012 10:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Aside: We're gonna have to start "How should I ask this question" threads, to get past all this semantic cruft so that the actual data that OPs presumably want can be collected in their main "question/poll" threads!]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392885/#Comment_392885" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T11:59:02+00:00" title="October  9, 2012 11:59AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun per hour is best measured in gigglewats, or rather gigglewat hours.<br/><br/>Even that metric is a bit hamfisted though. really the concern is that the ampage matches the mood of the group. casual games with low ampage let people participate at their own pace, high ampage games draw the full attention of the group and keep a quick pace. <br/><br/>I don't run games that require more prep than what a board game demands.

I think it's interesting to see how people have reacted, particularly the "games aren't meant to be fun" line of thought, which suggests to me that people have some wildly different ideas about what fun means.<br/><br/>For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that by "fun" I'm talking about a positive reward cycle- something you want or need that you get out of the game, the thing that pleases you and keeps you coming back. I think we can also assume that in most games there is a lot of low-level fun that occasionally build to exceptional peaks. Some games might be all low-level, mellow fun and others might be turned up to eleven the entire time, full of laughter and shenanigans. <br/><br/>From people's responses I get the impression that what matters is the average over time- 3 relatively dull sessions leading up to something magnificent might balance out as a good game overall. Lots of lonely-fun prep work for one person that makes a really solid session for a group is certainly a standard with some RPGs. Part of what I'm interested in is how little is too little- when do you walk away from a bad game? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392952/#Comment_392952" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-09T21:27:45+00:00" title="October  9, 2012  9:27PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread!<br/><br/>For me, there are basically two ways a game session can be bad:<br/><br/>1) If the pacing is awkward, people are hesitant, there's some page-flipping, that kind of thing. That's not a big deal if I'm playing with friends and we're starting something new or trying something new. It can be a little unpleasant at times, but it doesn't generally send me running. (It's much more of a problem when this sort of thing happens in a con game, but still understandable to some extent*.)<br/><br/>2) Deal-breakingly bad, which almost always comes from the GM or facilitator, and is generally more specific than bad pacing or awkwardness. (Note that at cons, even if a deal-breaker comes up I won't *always* walk away depending on how awkward it would be.) Deal-breakers are: GM Fiat and/or railroading, and, relatedly, rules ignorance.<br/><br/>It's vanishingly rare that I will consider a game unacceptably un-fun if we are playing RAW... except when *I* run a bad session, because I have high standards for myself.

Let's say I'm at Gen Con and I've started a game in a four-hour slot.  The game basically has to be less fun either of cruising the dealer room or sitting in a corner and reading or finding friends for a pick-up game.  And since getting up and leaving is a little awkward (it's unfun to reveal to the other players just how much I think they suck), it has to be somewhat less fun, not just take-it-or-leave-it unfun.  But if we're talking about a game with my friends at home, the opportunity cost is different.  I can look at the number of free Sundays I have stretching out before me and shrug off a few mediocre sessions in the pursuit of trying new games or looking for that slow build up to something really cool.  I'm also more committed to not hurting anyone's feelings when I intend to play with the people for years or I feel actual friendship with them.\n<blockquote>...we mustn't assume that the best games (as people remember them) are the ones that produced the most positive experiences.</blockquote>\nHa...I wrote up a paragraph questioning this before I realized I was just agreeing!

I've only walked one time, and it was when the game was pitched as high-action and then we spent the whole time investigating and politicking. And I didn't walk on that until, like, the eighth session, when it was obvious that the GM wasn't ever going to offer what was pitched.<br/><br/>(My favorite moment was when, after an HOUR of in-character planning and whinging, some PC asked mine "What do you think, Storm Surge?"

I've done this before, but only for generally BAD games. (I have a timed transcript of one particular game I played in which is painful to read, even though some elements of the game were fun.)<br/><br/>I've never tried to do this at a really good game.<br/><br/>But I think another factor is, as Deliverator brings up, our standards of "gaming goodness". I've played in a lot of games that weren't so bad that I wanted to walk out, but also had lots of low points and boring moments. But I'm not thinking of those as the baseline, because I want my gaming to be better than that. (This is one reason I game very rarely.) <br/><br/>My benchmark for "successful game" is quite a bit higher than that, for better or worse. So, I don't know: maybe I am mis-remembering my "good" games, or maybe my standard for a "good" game is just unreasonably high, and if I gamed more often, I'd realize just how rare those experiences are.<br/><br/>Edit: To be a little clearer:<br/><br/>If I take the "average" game from my gaming experience, yes, it's certainly not 100% fun, not even remotely, and yet I enjoyed those games enough to keep playing. However, I have the impression (whether it's correct or not, I don't know) that in future games I will be able to achieve a much higher level of "fun"/enjoyment consistently, and so I'm using the upper end of my game experience as my benchmark for future "successful" gaming. I expect my gaming to get better every time, not stay the same!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393046/#Comment_393046" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T15:03:34+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  3:03PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2012 7:33PM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun is forgetting about time(death).

We'd known each other for years before everyone decided to give this RPG thing a try; when the gang come over, we play a game for a couple of hours and then talk shit for a couple more.<br/><br/>What this means, ultimately, is that we have a load of fun. Like, buckets. Last time we played <i>Our Last Best Hope</i>, one friend played their doctor as Bane, complete with accent. Does this produce great roleplaying? No, probably not - no-one's ever <i>really</i> in character, and the game takes a back seat to whatever crazy crap we're talking about. Last week it was how fat Val Kilmer has gotten. I'd go so far as to say that the group is probably never going to have a perfect role-playing experience.<br/><br/>But boy, do we have fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393072/#Comment_393072" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T18:28:53+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  6:28PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Last week it was how fat Val Kilmer has gotten.</blockquote>\nAnd in such a weird way, too! Seriously, it's more like he's swollen than like he's fat. It's like a Marlon Brando/Orson Welles kind of fat, where you can just barely see the skeleton of the young actor trapped inside this larger, less mobile actor. Like someone made a Val Kilmer fat suit and then had Val Kilmer climb inside of it.<br/><br/>...yeah, that's pretty much how our game goes, too. ;-) We do get in character and have scenes where everyone is 100% focused on the game, but then we'll go off on a conversational tangent about something totally unrelated.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/desc" title="desc"><img alt="desc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/497/nWDBLQIAI0PSE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/desc">desc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393118/#Comment_393118" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T11:02:24+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 11:02AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the most objective means of determining FPH would clearly be to use some sort of lap timer or counter that you could click every time you have fun.<br/><br/>Then you take it to a con and start the timer as soon as you sit down. If the game slows down for any reason, be sure to sigh loudly, look at a player or the GM, and then hold the Fun-o-meter in front of you wistfully. <br/><br/>I'm confident that any GM would be enthusiastic and motivated to excel as your clicks provided helpful, Pavlovian feedback. Likewise, the other players at the table will appreciate a binder wherein you compare their contributions to FPH agains other games at the con. "Better bump your level of fun generation 20% if you want to at least be average," you could suggest helpfully.<br/><br/>Brb setting up a kickstarter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
