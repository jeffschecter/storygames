Now I am a firm believer that anyone can take any game and "make" it fit however they want to play - but I also enjoy knowing that I'm "getting it" as to what the original writers/designers intended.<br/><br/>I often wonder - if one of those writers/designers sat down at my table would they like the game I present as a GM of their creation?  Would they be blown away?  Or would they be shocked, disgruntled, or try to help me understand what I'm not "getting" about how/why they built the game/setting.<br/><br/><br/>I have the some thoughts about how other gamers play the same games I play as well.<br/><br/><br/>I thought about this based on a conversation that I was having last evening with a friend of mine (hey John!)  when we were talking about COLD CITY.  We both love the game but also both have slightly different takes on how to play and what to bring out of it in the setting the most.  Me - I like the spy-game aspect with monster fun sprinkled in.  John likes the monster aspect much more.<br/>Both are fine, both rock.  But it's interesting to me to see that we have different takes on the same idea.  And I wonder what the creator of the game would lean toward.  Not that it'd change my direction - it's just interesting to know where the game was born from.<br/><br/><br/>Same said of games like D&amp;D (whatever edition).  With the right group and motivation I think any group can take any game (like D&amp;D) and build a great "story game" out of it.<br/><br/><br/>I'd love to hear thoughts on this.  <br/>Or better yet - any play style descriptions of how you've played a game that might be in contrast or a little different to what the original game was intended to do according to style/theme, etc...<br/><br/><br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153361/#Comment_153361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T11:08:06+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 11:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some games, I think Cold City falls under this category, are designed especially so you could play them as several distinct 'games' using the same rule-set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153385/#Comment_153385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T12:01:18+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 12:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin,<br/><br/>It is an interesting question.  Myself, I like to know quite explicitly what the designer intended and why.  I also feel free to bend, fold, and mutilate his creation as needed.  I've come across people with extreme view in both directions.  Either they think the designer intent is the word of god, or they don't care about what he intended at all.  Personally, I don't understand either position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153394/#Comment_153394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T12:19:25+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 12:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I don't have a good reason, or ability, to change a ruleset without having a firm grasp of what the designer intended. I'm an inveterate tinkerer, but I like to know what I'm tinkering with before I start snipping wires.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd like to see more game designers explicate why things work the way they do. While I'm as giddy as a school girl when really interesting player behavior emerges from the rules, some rulesets just don't work right without some (and better) front-loading. My best/worst example is how Luke writes B* games -- I continue to be awed at the genius of how his games work, but they're not written in a way that clarifies why and how they do what they do. Both BW and BE involved a lengthy discovery process, lots of at-the-table frustration, lots of community chatter, and then a blinding AHA! moment...which might come too late for the rest of my players, who are not doing the same heavy rumination on it.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153396/#Comment_153396" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T12:21:47+00:00" title="June 27, 2008 12:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Jason Corley hasn't arrived to tell you that no one plays the way the designer intends yet!

To my shock, I discovered I'd been running it incorrectly when someone who actually reads and concentrates on the rules took the helm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of my problem was that I found the basic card mechanic depressing (I hate the idea of cards that just don't score) and had made some new cards with +1's and +2s at the top (hey, I figured adding one to the value of each card would help.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I had the fan mail rules all jumbled up. (I'd just pile all the fanmail alotted for the game in the center of the table and let players grab it whenever they wanted, refilling the pool when the hearts cards came up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought the conflict resolution was all about "yes, and... " and "yes, but..." style rulings, but when me and another player set up a conflict the GM started a third axis and proposed a set of stakes where we both failed. I was pretty sure you couldn't do this, but it turns out the rules can be interpreted this way with reasonable clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so convinced I was interpreting this "don't say no" rule right, however, that I got into a half-hour-long argument with the GM. Also, I thought any conflict could only have two sides, even if more than two protagonists were participating.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the previous games I played SEEMED to run okay, but since I've never finished a full season, I was probably driving people off. Unfortunately, it looks like even the one I played with the correct rules won't make it all five episodes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'm not a great GM, so it's not really suprising that I tend to hamstring rules for my own purposes. But sometimes you just have to do what works for you and beg the players to finish out the campaign, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153503/#Comment_153503" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-28T01:28:21+00:00" title="June 28, 2008  1:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that any two groups play any game the same way, so how you can play the game as the designer would is beyond me. Even when I have been testing Duty &amp; Honour, I have found that the way I play changes depending on the group that I am playing with. Some people are all up for the indie goodness and run with the Mission system like fauns in a wood whilst others need a little more direction and nudging. Its all good as long as people are having a good time!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who is on the brink of publishing I have to say that when I have heard that people have been playing my game, THATS the moment of freak out amazement for me. Then when I hear that they have done something totally wild with the mechanics and come up with a totally different situation I just think - thats BRILLIANT. I'll make a solemn pact with anyone that buys my game. If you slap down the $$$ for the game, read it and think 'you know, this game could do with XXX' or 'Thats great, but lets slip it into the War of 1812 instead?' I promise I will NEVER send the Ultra Polite Brit Ninjas to enforce the game as written. Cross my heart. That cool? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY time I have had a problem is when people have said 'The game doesn't account for X' and I say 'Yes it does, its on page Y'.  If the stuff is there, laid out, indexed and referenced, there's precious little the writer can do if someone isn't going to read the text and just assume you have missed something. Or as it was in this case, read the warning that a certain rule is designed for one thing and not another and then proceed to do the other and watch as the rule falls apart at the seams.

Depending on which school of thought you follow, the meaning of a story is either entirely in the hands of the reader, the text or the author. Or even the cultural framework it's being read in. Which maps nicely onto arguing for playing games "any way you please", "by the rules", "as the author intended" or "by dominant playstyle". <br><br>I can see value in all but the last approach, and I don't think any of them is inherently better or more useful than the other. They're all true in a way, and it really doesn't matter which one you prefer. The worst that can happen is that you will enjoy certain games/books more than others.<br><br>But much like in literary criticism there's this whiff of superiority and arrogance around the "do whatever you want with it"-crowd. But not everybody wants the hassle of shaping the game around their personal preferences. Not everybody sees it as desirable or even necessary to do this to get the most out of the game. And I think that approach is prefectly legitimate. I can easily imagine that some may find it easier to discern "author's intent" or "how the rules interact to shape the game" than figuring out what they want from a roleplaying game and how they can get it from this game they bought.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154062/#Comment_154062" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T05:33:08+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  5:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The major difference is, the only instruction required to operate a novel is that you have to know how to read.
