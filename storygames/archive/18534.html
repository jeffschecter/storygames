To be more clear, what sort of teenage experience does this exemplify and exaggerate? Reading your flavor text, it immediately jumped out at me that this could be the person who had to grow up too fast, to take on all the responsibilities of adulthood while still in high school. That concept can go the distance - it's a fairly common theme, especially in Buffy. However, that theme doesn't come through especially strongly in the rest of the Skin.<br/>And did you intend to put it into the metaphor at all? Maybe this is just a cool type of character you thought would play well in the MH environment, and that's okay too. But personally I'm drawn to Skins that relate to the real teen experience as well.<br/><br/>The moves have some okay direction to them, but are generally uninspiring. Some have some cool implications (like the High Tech Gear of Spy Gadgets), but it doesn't reinforce the use of these crazy things. Additionally, a lot of the moves seem to be purely mechanical - Special Forces Training and Survival Training (maybe avoid using two moves with "training" in the name?) both are purely mechanical, with no reinforcement that the mechanics being triggered have anything to do with your Special Forces talents or your Survival abilities. The biggest thing I would think about here is how to add fiction-based triggers to your moves. Instead of "When you have a break after using a highlighted stat," for example, perhaps try something like "When you hunker down and find shelter in a hostile environment...". That has a distinct feeling of triggering when your survival training is important, evoking the flavor of the move and the character, and doesn't simply rely on a mechanical distinction.<br/>Basically, you have fiction and you have mechanics, but the two don't meet very often.<br/><br/>Also, consider adding a roll to a move. My mind instantly says that Spy Gadgets should be a roll of some kind. Maybe 10+ you have the right tool for the job, 7-9 you need to jury-rig something from other tools or make due with something lesser.<br/><br/>Darkest Self is generally good, but it's obviously fairly similar to The Infernal's. You may want to consider a different mechanism so the two don't feel alike, but the current one is thematically appropriate, so it might be fine to keep it.<br/><br/>It ain't all negative though! A lot of the fiction pieces you have are really cool. The organization and Origin lists are pretty great.<br/><br/>Oh, you mention a move called <i>Cover Up</i> in the Playing The Agent section, but no such move exists in the Skin. Betting it was either a draft move or you forgot to include it.<br/><br/>A good start man!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417063/#Comment_417063" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T23:14:34+00:00" title="June 24, 2013 11:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the concept.<br/><br/>I am not sure how well balanced the moves are, but I'm not especially good at figuring that out.
