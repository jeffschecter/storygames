Forgive me for the vague, "what if... or what if..." presentation; it was more or less written off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a D4, a D6, a D8, a D10 and a D12. Each of these is going to represent a scene, so some could be left out for shorter games.<br/><br/>Players should agree on an overall plot, and write down the final challenge they'll be facing on an index card. Then players make "challenges" which will be the topics of individual scenes. There need to be 5 challenges if there are 6 dice; so maybe players should have 1 more die than there are total players, or each player could make 2 challenges; it all depends on desired game length.<br/><br/>Challenges are shuffled and then drawn one at a time. How the scenes are played out is, the players come up with a plan to overcome the challenge. The plan has to involve every player character, and every character has to be necessary for success. This forces players to make up facts explaining why each person is necessary.<br/><br/>So for example let's say we're playing in a fantasy setting and the plot is "stop the death cult from overthrowing the kingdom's government". We might be playing a fire-themed mage, a skilled knight with political connections, and a priestess whose visions warned us of the cult's plan. Then the challenge that comes up is "Death cult summons the demon Gog-Agog in the middle of the city". We decide this necessitates our characters' intervention because the demon is invisible to everyone but the priestess. The knight could be the only one who can pierce its hide, and the mage, the only one who can do enough damage to actually take the demon out.<br/><br/>The players arrange their character cards on the table in order as a way of representing the plan. (In this case, Priestess first, then Knight, then Mage.) If necessary I suppose the plan could be explicitly written out. Anyway, it should be agreed why each step needs to succeed, and it should be clear why the plan as a whole is necessary (rather than, say, relying on the city guard).<br/><br/>Then players will (secretly?) choose a die to use on the scene. Each die is only used on one scene, so players will do well in some scenes and poorly in others. In order to succeed at their part of the plan, they will need to roll better than a 1 or 2.<br/><br/>A player whose character fails can decide exactly what went wrong; it can be the character's mistake, a basic flaw in the plan, or some outside influence. This might change the players' idea of what exactly is going on. However, established facts cannot be contradicted, in particular the facts which made a player necessary. So for example, the knight might fail to pierce the demon's hide. It would be no good to decide the knight simply missed and could try again - the plan must change. But it would also be bad to decide the characters were simply wrong, and the demon's hide is unbreakable. Better to say the demon grabs and breaks the adamantium spear which was the only weapon strong enough.<br/><br/>The player narrates what exactly goes wrong, and then has to come up with a new plan which still involves their character. Ideally they will find a new way to accomplish their own portion of the plan, so that the other steps will be unchanged. If everything has to be shifted around, the new plan still needs to keep everyone involved, which means more facts might be invented to make characters necessary. Then the player re-rolls the same (possibly small) die to try and succeed at their step of the new plan.<br/><br/>This process is repeated until the characters finally each succeed at something, and the challenge is taken care of. Ideally each failure should mean some sort of loss, for example the knight losing his adamantium spear, or the demon getting into the palace and killing someone important before it's all over. But, there are some other good options for dealing with failure:<br/><br/>First of all, in "Machine of Death", the whole plan execution phase is timed. Players take their time coming up with an initial 3-step assassination plan, but then have 90 seconds to narrate that plan including improvised solutions when one step fails. If you run out of time, then of course the entire plan fails. This would probably be a reasonable way to play, granting 30 or 40 seconds per character.<br/><br/>Secondly, if a character fails too much maybe other characters should be able to step in and take control of the plan. For example, suppose the knight just can't manage to break through the demon's hide, so the mage narrates coming up with some sort of spell that might do it. There should be a price to pay - maybe the mage has to burn down a city block to get the spell to work, or attracts the attention of other powerful entities. Furthermore, skipping a person like than gives their player a black token to be used later. Black tokens represent strife or enmity in the group. I'm imagining they can be used to turn against the group and (temporarily?) fight against everyone else, either for selfish reasons like getting all the reward, or actually changing sides. Normally, everyone has to agree on the plan that's created, so selfish actions are difficult. The black token allows elements of the plan to happen without group agreement. Maybe they would have other uses, like allowing you to skip someone else as payback. (This should take the form of arrogantly stepping in and doing their job, not simply leaving them out of the narration.)<br/><br/>Third, there could be different degrees of failure. This might make for too much thinking in the timed version, but a "1" could be a definite personal failure, but a "2", just something unexpected interfering.<br/><br/>Fourth, I think it might would be really cool if, when the team totally fails (ie, the timer runs out), the next challenge card comes out - just as if you had succeeded - but the old challenge stays active.<br/><br/>Mechanically, of course, this would mean getting off easy. But for the characters, it means the situation gets much worse. Rather than confronting problems one at a time, everything is going wrong at once. I like the possibility of the challenges intertwining instead of being episodic. It makes me want this to be possible in the timer-less version too. For example, suppose someone keeps failing with their D4 and is sick of it. Maybe they could discard the D4 - as if the current scene were over - and draw a new die, provided they also draw a new challenge, making the situation more complicated.<br/><br/>Since this mechanism skips players, the skipped players should probably get an extra roll in the new scene. This has the advantage of giving more breathing space to deal with the two simultaneous problems. But requiring two rolls from a character in the new scene also adds some challenge to the planning. Also, I'm not sure what would happen with the dice which would have been discarded at the end of the (failed) challenge. Do the people with two rolls in the new scene need to use two different dice for them?<br/><br/>As an additional complication, such combined challenge scenes could be required to end with some unresolved consequences. The two challenges should be overcome, but something else should happen which carries over to the next scene.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442967/#Comment_442967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-17T22:28:15+00:00" title="February 17, 2015 10:28PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this sounds really interesting and fun! I'll address all of your points in turn:<br/><br/>- Using a D4, a D6, a D8, a D10 and a D12 - that's a lot of unique dice. I know, it's normal for many RPGs, but this sounds like it'd love the accessibility that using only D6 would bring. This isn't a complaint or anything - just a note. I think using different-sided dice is actually a great, intuitive way to represent degrees of success.<br/><br/>-Writing down the final challenge in advance is interesting, but possibly negates the fun of discovering it over the course of play? You could also simply leave the final challenge open to interpretation, for example, "A sudden betrayal threatens the entire world". Thing is, while 'knowing' the conclusion in advance may lower the surprise factor and lead to information players should not fictionally have, I also think it could be fun as a 'motivator', something you're building up to. Just things to consider...<br/><br/>-"Making up facts explaining why each character is necessary" - does this go in turns? By communal decision? To use your example, who decided the knight's utility was his ability to pierce the demon's hide? Everyone, himself, someone else, or another thing altogether? What if there are multiple competing facts that people cannot agree on?<br/><br/>-Choosing dice secretly won't change much - people can just talk out what dice they're gonna play before they choose, and there's no incentive to lie, as there's no player competition (beyond the 'black token', but that's a hypothetical at this stage.) If a rule prevents them from discussing their choices, this would work. It has both really fun moments - of surprise, tension, triumph - but also unfun ones, where everyone happened to place a low die on this challenge. Playtesting will reveal whether that's worth it or not, I guess.<br/><br/>-Just for my own thoughts: better than a 2 is 50%, 66%, 75%, 80%, 83%. I think that's a pretty fair distribution, since you do get multiple tries.<br/><br/>-Why does the plan <i>have</i> to change? I think I can glean why - you want to force players to be more creative beyond "I miss!" - but it seems pretty vague. For example: We're stealing from a bank. We expected three guards. I fail the roll, I declare there are instead <i>four</i> guards, someone we didn't expect is in attendance. We still are going to fight, I'm just going to take more damage due to the extra combatant - so the plan didn't change, but the consequences of our plan most certainly did. Is that sufficiently creative to count as a failure? Using your reasoning, I can certainly see why not - you want to push for more 'dramatic' failures than that. But it seems like a moment your game would want... as it is now, it's either dramatic success (everything goes right!) or dramatic failure (everything goes wrong!), but no middle-ground, of "everything worked, but it took far more out of us than we expected".<br/><br/>-The re-roll is the greatest reason to go with the 'plan must change' idea, as it's a lot harder to explain with, for example, the aforementioned scenario above. If I had to make an explanation, I'd make the reroll of a scenario like the one above be "Unexpected consequences". <br/><br/>-Timing sounds important - a sense of urgency will help the game greatly, I feel, and make for fun moments where people are rushing to think of something, ANYTHING, to get out of this pickle!<br/><br/>-I'd say letting another player take over your repeated-failure should require a few things: a certain number of consecutive failures (3?), and group consensus, including your own. The black token as payment, allowing for you to 'override' the group, is really smart. You could represent it in lots of ways... I like the idea of it creating 'selfish' actions as a result of the group valuing success over your commitment. Conflict within a team is great for plot points, but when I see 'taking over for someone's failure', I also see another interpretation besides this one: 'the cavalry'!<br/><br/>This isn't a suggestion, just my musing: another interpretation is a 'white token', which represents someone else helping you out, giving you the final push you needed to make your plan work. The white token, when paid, allows you to then steal the spotlight yourself - you get to do something dramatic, awesome, successful, all on your own. Balancing out the spotlight, in other words. <br/><br/>Again, not really recommending it as an idea... just thinking out loud. ( :<br/><br/>-Degrees of failure could be based on:<br/>-- The size of your dice. The bigger your die, the less it was <i>your</i> fault.<br/>-- The number of people who failed. If multiple people fail, well, it makes less sense that they <i>all</i> screwed up at once, right? One person failing, probably their fault; two people failing, something's up; if <i>three</i> people fail? That's probably connected!<br/><br/>The former is good because it's quick - you already know which dice you have, so interpreting its result will be faster. The latter takes time to count up.<br/><br/>The latter is good, because it weaves together the character's plots even more, and it feels more dynamic. The former you can predict in advance; the latter, you cannot.<br/><br/>-I agree that 'snowballing' the challenges is a great idea, in both your timer and timerless iterations. When would the group truly 'fail' though? Couldn't they theoretically snowball the entire deck out, and just be juggling all these problems at once until they solve it?<br/><br/>Would 'decking out' mean you lost? Would it be a 'threshold', for example, you can only juggle as many challenges as you have people before you 'game over'? Or what?<br/><br/>-How does the mechanism skip players? I think I missed something vital there.<br/><br/>-I love the idea of 'combined challenges' having serious consequences. Makes it more risky.<br/><br/>Overall: You have an extremely solid basis of an idea here. I look forward to seeing it fleshed out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter" title="Dranorter"><img alt="Dranorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter">Dranorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442976/#Comment_442976" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T03:31:06+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  3:31AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You make some interesting points!<br/><br/>First let me try and clear up the confusion regarding skipping players. Just re-using my same fantasy example, suppose the knight has lost his spear and comes up with a plan to crush the demon in the palace gate, which is also adamantium. Then the new roll fails and the player decides it's time to use something other than a D4 (or, of course, the player runs out of time). The next challenge comes out early... maybe "destroy cult hideout". The players now take a step back from the narrative to figure out a new plan, which has to tackle both the demon and the cult hideout. But the mage's turn has been skipped - since the knight hasn't pierced the skin of the demon, the mage never got to roll. Thus it would make sense to allow or even require the mage have two rolls in the new plan. I'm not sure if that should be true of the knight. The knight sort of got skipped in the sense that he didn't get to succeed in that scene, but maybe that's the price paid for this move.<br/><br/>Usually the first of the two rolls would be used to do what the mage didn't do before - kill the demon. But suppose we draw that "destroy cult hideout" card, and the players are struggling to come up with a way for the two plots to collide. The mage decides to use a spell to return the demon to where it came from - and this pulls the characters along with it. So everyone ends up in the cultist hideout. I suppose then the second roll would finish of the demon; but maybe they could find some way of unsummoning it, or turning it against the cult, instead. In such a case, the mage has this second roll which might not feel necessary - but must be narrated as necessary.<br/><br/>I have a lot more thoughts but unfortunately have run out of time. I'll write more later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442980/#Comment_442980" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T05:52:26+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  5:52AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ohhhh, I see.

I was optimistic in my example. But suppose the players decide to do a crime-oriented story, and several challenges are major heists. This seems like something the planning structure would be perfect at - it echoes heist films, where each character is brought to the team for some unique criminal expertise. But I can't see how a second robbery could be brought in meaningfully in the middle of the first one.<br/><br/>There could be different sorts rules for dealing with this problem:<br/>1) Require challenges to be of a sort which interrupts the players, rather than something they go do<br/>2) Have players make a small mark on the back of their card if the challenge they make is of this sort. When something like this is needed, blank-back cards are ignored and the next 'combining-friendly' one is drawn.<br/>3) If players can't figure out a good way to combine the challenge, they lose the game and narrate failure<br/>4) Come up with a new challenge which can mesh well.<br/><br/>As to the different size dice... I agree the prep-less, gm-less feel of the rules sort of fits with D6's; and the different sizes aren't too necessary to the fun of the game. But honestly I enjoy using a variety of dice, and most people I'm likely to play with have dice collections anyway.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure how the planning and making up facts should be carried out. It seems natural to say players are in charge of their own character and their section of the plan, but I'm just not sure how that would play. Coming up with the details of the situation and figuring out why each person is necessary can be pretty hard! I definitely wouldn't want to restrict it to be done in turns. Sometimes things won't click until one person comes up with a different way of looking at the situation- and that new idea basically will define everyone's role.<br/><br/>That brings up another point too. Unless I stipulate that all character abilities have to be made up in a character creation phase, the planning phase of every scene will usually involve making up capabilities which make your character uniquely necessary. Players will likely lean on established abilities, but still, there could be some tendency to reveal some crazy power late in the game. So, it might be better to limit the creation of important character traits to the first two or three challenges. After that, players should be encouraged to make themselves necessary in subtler or more plot-driven ways; for example one person could get captured in battle and find out important plot information while escaping from the enemy. (Note; including technically 'unplanned' events in the plan, like getting captured, is fine and makes the plot better. The players, while planning out the scene, are not really pretending to be the characters; their 'plan' can include things the characters couldn't know would happen. But it's important that the major points of potential failure be more deliberate, so that failure at them makes more sense.) Sometimes it might be good to decide dramatic stuff has happened in between challenges, to get more material.<br/><br/>The percentage failure of the dice mostly needs to ensure most scenes will involve one or two failures. For larger groups, then, it makes sense to allow larger dice, to even things out and keep plans from being obliterated by failure. In a 3 player game I envision people failing about 1/3 of the time... with just a D4, D6, and D8 the average failure rate is a bit higher than that at 36%. With all five dice the average is 29%.<br/><br/>The original thought between the varied dice sizes and the black tokens was that characters only have a fixed amount of effort or strength to put forth during the adventure, but they don't exactly understand each others' limitations and can get upset with each other for these failures. It might reinforce this idea if there were narrative effects for choosing a larger or smaller die. Perhaps the lower half of the dice sizes means you should play your character as questioning the group's motives, depressed, unengaged, distracted by life's simpler pleasures, etc. But then again, that might make the player feel less engaged. Requiring that these dice cause more personal failures might be simpler.<br/><br/>Your points about the 'plan must change' rule are pretty interesting. To me this is fundamental to the game. I don't know if you watched the "Machine of Death" video I linked, but in that game a failure typically means you don't have a piece of equipment you needed, or that equipment doesn't work. So you draw a new equipment card and have to rework the plan to use it, coming up with a reason it's necessary.<br/><br/>My game doesn't give nearly as much of a prompt, I suppose. I want players to have something thoroughly fail, yet I don't provide an immediate source of a new approach. I'm not sure without trying it that this is a big enough problem to warrant adding a mechanic. If players are playing interesting enough characters they should be able to come up with something, I hope. But I'll have to find out.<br/><br/>I think that you're right about "succeed, but..." being missing from the game. In the untimed version, it might work to just have a roll of 3 be narrated as a near-failure. In the timed version the coolness of the extra narration would be competing with the need to quickly move on to the next task.<br/><br/>Your comment on re-rolling makes me wonder what the game would be like without re-rolling. So, say, your roll fails, then you have to fail in some significant way, and possibly reorganize the plan, but whatever the new narration is, it automatically succeeds. That might work as a game, but it feels much different to me.<br/><br/>Given my 'rewrite the plan' requirement I think two failures would definitely be enough to allow another player to interfere. After one failure you have to come up with a new approach. Having to do that a second time before someone else steps in might be a little tiresome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter" title="Dranorter"><img alt="Dranorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter">Dranorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442992/#Comment_442992" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T15:29:50+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  3:29PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some other ideas I had but didn't include in my initial post.<br/><br/>It might be reasonable to let players switch which dice they're using on a failure, so that if you pick a D4 you're not necessarily stuck failing over and over. But of course the die you succeed with is the one that gets discarded at the end of the scene, so you might fail with the D4 quite a few times and get stuck using it over and over. (Which is fine - the failure mechanism is what makes it fun.)<br/><br/>I had thought about having separate white tokens... Not sure how extensive I want the system to be, but in a version using a timer, suppose the group reaches the goal early. Maybe they simply succeed at all their rolls. With the remaining time, they might be able to come up with additional accomplishments to tackle. (Machine of Death does this.) Suppose the trio I've been using as an example succeeds in slaying the demon with plenty of spare time. Then they decide to try and find the cultists who summoned it, neutralize the cult's ability to summon demons, etc. Each of these challenges would be offered by one player to a different player's character, along with (as during the main plan) a reason why that character is the only one who could do it. The player would roll the same die they've been using the whole challenge. Failure would need to be narrated a bit before someone could propose another extra goal. Not sure who should get a white token on success - the successful player or the one who proposed the challenge. Both?<br/><br/>If no timer is used, these extra challenges could be based on runs of good luck. So if you succeed on every single roll for the original plan, you get to try an extra goal. Keep making extra goals until someone fails one, then move on. I like this because it might otherwise seem a little boring to roll all successes.<br/><br/>What should white tokens do? I think they would allow cooperative rolls. An ordinary plan can contain cooperative steps, where two characters need to more or less simultaneously succeed in order to proceed. Spending a white token could allow these rolls to succeed as long as not everyone fails. I think it might be cool to make everyone involved spend a white token, so that three people rolling at once and taking the max costs a total of three white tokens. Or there's lots of other ways to handle it if the balance turns out to be a bit off. Maybe simply having a white token allows you to be in such a group roll, but black tokens cancel out white tokens so they're not always easy to hang on to. Or maybe if you do a group roll and you roll a 1 or 2, you spend the white token to 'lean on' whoever succeeded (and narrate accordingly).<br/><br/>An obvious variation of black and white tokens would be to have black and white dice; these could then be used as extra dice too, though white ones should be narrated as cooperation, and black ones as selfish or otherwise causing division.<br/><br/>A big variant I've been thinking about: a game like this wouldn't have to be very character-centric. Rather than each challenge being things the heroes accomplish, they could just be interesting things which happen. Each scene would then describe how the thing happens. (Players could be in charge of different elements of the world, meaning each such element would need to be involved in the events; or, it might work without ownership entirely.) Each player would control an event and explain why that event is necessary to accomplishing the scene. Failed rolls might get harder to interpret, but would still mean action didn't move toward the end in the way expected.<br/><br/>I like the idea of inserting a single 'challenge' of this version into other games. It seems like a cool way of answering world-building type questions. The question gives you an end goal you need to explain; the initial plan establishes some facts which make the answer more complicated; and the failed rolls along the way create an answer different from the plan.<br/><br/>For example, ask "how did the painting get stolen?", then each player names a person or thing which has to be involved, then the plan shows those elements' involvement, but the failures could result in someone else stealing the painting than expected.<br/><br/>In particular I like the idea of using this to replace the roleplaying in the game Microscope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442993/#Comment_442993" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-18T16:00:15+00:00" title="February 18, 2015  4:00PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smart ideas, all around.<br/><br/>Yeah, different size dice are very fun, agreed. At least including alternate rules for d6 might be helpful, right? Or at least a suggestion on how to make it work.<br/><br/>I agree that turn-based isnt the way to go - I was just asking what it was.<br/><br/>I agree that defining character abilities early is a good idea. A simple way to make that work is to say "If you reveal an ability later than character creation, you must be able to explain why you haven't used that ability yet." For example, if you can 1HKO bad guys, why didn't you use that before?<br/><br/>I was also thinking about changing up what the results of low and big dice mean. I was thinking the lower the dice, the more 'personal' the result - a D4 failure is your fault entirely, and a D4 success is a way to show off your skills and strength. On the other side of the coin, a D12 is 'impersonal', based on chance - a failure on a D12 is represented as some unluckiness or random event, and a success is due to forces outside of your control, not necessarily your own skill. This would incentivize people to pick D4 in order to 'show off' - take big risks, get big rewards! Helpfully, this also provides a bit more of a prompt.<br/><br/>I agree that "plans must change" is fundamental to the game - I was just noting the weird tone caused by having your fails only totally succeed or totally fail. This isn't a problem, at all - it's just a side-effect of the mechanics. I like the idea of 'borderline' successes, but I too agree it's too tough to track in the timed versions. <br/><br/>I like the idea of being able to switch dice on a failure. Especially if you give different 'meanings' to the different dice, since it'd make consecutive failures feel different.<br/><br/>White tokens letting you 'lean on' other people is really cool, I like it!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter" title="Dranorter"><img alt="Dranorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter">Dranorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443021/#Comment_443021" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-19T17:21:00+00:00" title="February 19, 2015  5:21PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2015 6:06PM by Dranorter.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the concept of the die size affecting successes too, not just more of failure. Smaller dice sort of naturally mean riskier actions, which pairs nicely with individualistic actions. In such a case, people should (publicly) choose dice <i>during </i>the planning phase, rather than directly after. So the plan itself would include the showy D4 success. Don't want to slow down the actual rolling with people trying to think up extra cool things.<br/><br/>Actually, a more dramatic way to handle this might be to have small dice allow a little monologue after the action is over. The idea would be a discussion held between the characters after the action... though the discussion might not literally happen, if the plot doesn't make that make sense. Anyway the person who uses a small die has the option of telling his fellows something awesome that happened during the scene, that they might have missed amidst all the action. For example the player who opens the vault in a bank robbery could do some really minimal narration before and after the die roll, but after the scene say "My research was totally wrong about the vault, it was made a' some fancy alloy, blowtorch didn' do nothin. Fortunately I brought the nitro glycerin..."<br/><br/>That kind of extra privilege works in either the timed our untimed version. The same approach could work for narrating a 3 in the timed version, too.<br/><br/>This is probably not the best idea, but - what if, instead of small dice being personal or individualistic, critical successes were? That way, the D4's would automatically be more opportunity to show off.<br/><br/>I've gotta playtest this and see which things players actually find interesting. I like for reading the dice to be a little complex, but it's important that the complexities be something people are happy to use. Same with the black and white tokens, naturally. I'm aiming for a fairly rules-y game... gotta be careful about the rules being good for something.<br/><br/>I should also think a little about the types of strategies the game encourages. There might be a big advantage to having cooperative steps in the plan so that everyone rolls at once. If successful, such rolls would save a lot of time. I feel like it's perfectly logical to have elements in the plan like "it takes two of us to lift the log," and then both people roll at once. But I wouldn't want people to feel encouraged to do that in order to beat the timer. Perhaps the timer should allow 30 (or 40) seconds times number of steps (rather than number of players)? But, that seems a bit harsh.<br/><br/>White tokens providing an advantage against the timer seems more fair, since they're earned. In a game where there's a real buildup of white tokens, the team would get more and more cooperative as it went, which would hopefully be satisfying team development.<br/><br/>It might pay off to use D4's right away in order to narrate in better capabilities right away. Showy, individualistic successes are more valuable early on when you have more room to make up things about your character.<br/><br/>A potential problem I keep forgetting to write down or think about is the ordering of the plan. The example team I was using had a priestess with prophetic visions. There's a definite risk of that sort of character - a quest-giver type - always being first in the plan. I'd be happy to see what sorts of reorganizations people make when their heroes initially fail to even notice something bad is going on, so I have no problem with that. But if any player systematically doesn't roll until near the end, then there might be several annoyances.<br/><br/>Firstly there is of course the timer; the last player is the most affected by the time limit. Secondly, it's possible their element of the plan would be changed several times as other people fail. Is that a bad thing? I'll have to see it play out really. Thirdly, going last might mean having the least narrative input. Narration is going to be fast-paced, but it'll still be determining things about the world, and whoever goes last will be working with many elements already determined.<br/><br/>The only time I can think of when a character would be systematically placed last would be if they're a heavy hitter. A really powerful character is theoretically OK in this game - every character has to be necessary, so they can't take out the bad guys singlehandedly. But the easiest way for such a character to be used is as the last step, after the other characters clear the way for that death strike.<br/><br/>If any of this is a real problem, I might try a rotating plan order, a different person starting each plan (maybe start the one you wrote?) and the characters becoming necessary in clockwise fashion from them. Actually coming up with the plan would still be free-form.<br/><br/>I still think the lack of prompts on failure might be a big deal. Failure takes something away but doesn't give something new in return.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443022/#Comment_443022" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-19T17:38:03+00:00" title="February 19, 2015  5:38PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2015 5:38PM by catty_big.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a terrific idea <a href="/forums/profile/Dranoter">@Dranoter</a>!

So they could get an 'attack of opportunity', to use an analogy, or something like that? They get a chance to do something themselves in immediate response to the looming threat, or even to pitch and and help define that threat? <br/><br/>I don't think it's too big of a deal, though. Being a cooperative game, everyone has to agree on their place in the plan. If someone keeps getting pushed to the back and doesn't like it, they can just protest that and move ahead a bit.

The scene structure I tacked on (shuffling and drawing challenges) may well work, but is not too exciting to me; it's just borrowed from Storyboard. What if instead, I repeated the game's basic mechanism twice, nested?<br/><br/>So, the first step when starting a game is to come up with an overarching "plan" for the plot. Just like the smaller plans for scenes, each element of this initial plan will concentrate on one character. Players will make up facts to explain why each step of the plan is necessary. But these steps are the "challenges" so they have to leave room for a little episode. There's room here to focus the game nicely - the rules could suggest that each player's challenge be a threat to something their character holds dear, or that each player's challenge should make their character come into some conflict or disagreement with the group. (I'm tempted to really push the group friction angle. Since the mechanics force anyone without black tokens to cooperate, the party basically can't break up. That means either group conflict will work great, since you can have lots of it without destroying the plot... or not work at all, since in a way the game keeps characters from acting on their conflicting motives.)<br/><br/>When players fail at a scene - say, by running out of time - then they get a chance to reevaluate the overall plan, just like for failures within scenes. And of course facts which were coined in order to make scenes necessary to the overall plot still have to be dealt with.<br/><br/>An interesting way to develop this game further would be to again borrow some from Machine of Death... what if it was a game about "psychics" or "seers", and trying to deal with their fragmented views of the future? So both the large plan and the plans for scenes would have some detail about their endpoint be forseen. These details would have to be cryptic enough to be flexible. It wouldn't matter too much if the psychic or precog characters were PCs or NPCs - they mainly just provide a few infallible predictions to get everything going.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm not claiming any sort of rights over this game idea. If I were to write up the rules in a document that would be different, but right now it's just a collection of borrowed ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter" title="Dranorter"><img alt="Dranorter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dranorter">Dranorter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443137/#Comment_443137" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-23T18:22:01+00:00" title="February 23, 2015  6:22PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting did not go all that well. I had fun, and I think the game did a lot for how short it was, but there were some clear problems and the other players didn't find it that engaging.<br/><br/>- Failing wasn't that fun. With the timer going, the focus is on finding a new approach as similar to the failed approach as you can narratively get away with.<br/>- Challenges were vague in the wrong ways. Well... there was some good flexibility. When "robot rampages through the city" came up, one player decided the robot was her creation and we were using it to attract attention. But challenges didn't provide enough of a fixed endpoint.<br/>- The challenges aren't like episodes; they can turn out much shorter. We played with 3 people, and 3 plot-necessary actions can happen in a couple of in-world minutes.  There were longer scenes too though.<br/>- Requiring each character be necessary for the plot isn't as strong a mechanism as I thought. It's easy enough to have people be necessary merely by chance. This is especially a temptation while reformulating the plan under the clock. One step in a plan was that something one of the characters did would randomly trigger a hypnotic command which had been planted in another character. It was too easy to argue any random thing might trigger the hypnotic command.<br/><br/>One way or another I need more limitation on what you do upon failure. The re-roll could be required to risk something valuable to the character (something which wasn't at risk before). Or, I could make a set of 'event' cards which are drawn from on failure, and they could provide some potential ways around the problem - "Make a connection you hadn't made", "A nemesis appears", that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Or maybe players should have to write down ahead of time <i>exactly</i> what fails on failure. For example "I will use my charms to seduce the ambassador" is a good role in a plan, but on failure the character would probably find some other way to seduce the ambassador (Get him drunk?) rather than failing at the seduction. That's not what I want since it doesn't really make the story head in an unexpected direction.<br/><br/>The Machine of Death game very specifically takes away a resource which you needed for the original plan. Perhaps rather than having to answer "why is your character necessary to the plan," players should answer "what resource makes you necessary to the plan" and, at least for the duration of the scene, lose that resource on failure.<br/><br/>I probably will go with something like one minute per player, especially with more complicated requirements on failure. That way there really is a little bit of time to narrate and to think. With 45 seconds per character, we never ran out of time but that was because there was some "cheating", using very slight variations of an action to reroll.<br/><br/>One of the players suggested that the fairly short nature of the scenes could be improved by further nesting the mechanism. So, 3 "challenges" each tackled in 3 "steps" each consisting of 3 "actions". In his conception, the "steps" would each be cooperative, though one character would be the focus; so, frequently the "actions" would be somewhat simultaneous.<br/><br/>To some extent I thought the game did a lot for its length. It just didn't quite do what I wanted with forcing interesting changes on the plan. So really, added requirements on the failure mechanism might be all it needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
