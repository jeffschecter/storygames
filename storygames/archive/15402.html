Fan fic? <br/><br/>Both!<br/><br/>You play newly turned Vampires with ultimate power and zero supernatural life experience. Because you're still mostly human, you get 2 months training, a diary, and a stake. Now go proclaim judgment upon Vampires who have given up their humanity. Or have they?<br/><br/>Travel from town to isolated town where Vampires try living quietly among humans. Towns welcome you with open arms but you\u2019re there to stir up its dirt and lay bare its sins.<br/><br/>You stand between humanity and the best intentions of the weak. You stand between those struggling to remain human and their own demons. Sometimes sinners do bad things for good reasons. Sometimes sinners want to repent but their victims want revenge. Sometimes it's better for one to die than for many to suffer. Sometimes you have to cut off the arm to save the life. Does the sinner deserve mercy? Do the wicked deserve judgment? You decide.<br/><br/>Rephrase Backgrounds to represent how you became a Vampire.<br/><br/>Replace Shooting with Biting (or the equivalent).<br/><br/>And instead of a Book of Life you have a diary handed down to you by those who have walked in your shoes. It is your job to continue the story; to write down what you experience so when you pass, those who follow will learn from your mistakes. Perhaps Short Term Fallout could have an option where you get all emo and write down what just happened to you in your diary. <br/><br/>I know this is ridiculous!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349465/#Comment_349465" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T10:41:08+00:00" title="November 22, 2011 10:41AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>I break your neck, throw you over the railing, then drink your whiskey: 4d10</b><br/><br/>That is all.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349466/#Comment_349466" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T10:42:30+00:00" title="November 22, 2011 10:42AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read that as "vampire police dog diaries", which I would be excited to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349470/#Comment_349470" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-22T11:09:55+00:00" title="November 22, 2011 11:09AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know the source material!<br/><br/>Why do these fresh young vampires have the authority to go and do this?

The show takes elements of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 90210, Slasher Horror, High School Teen Angst, and World of Darkness and blends it all together in a surprisingly pleasing sludge that goes down easy. <br/><br/>But what Vampire Diaries does have is towns with long histories of Supernatural creatures trying to coexist with human beings. Often in secret. Not all Vampires are bad. Not all good Vampires stay good. And sometimes the humans fighting the Vampires cause more problems than the Vampires themselves. I could easily imagine it all as a Dogs town.<br/><br/>Also, lots of characters write down their feelings in diaries. <br/><br/>You do see Vampire Hunters show up, not caring which Vampires are good and which are bad. <br/><br/>So this is where I turn a sharp left turn and try to use Dogs as is (as much as possible). What if the Vampire Hunters are more police. Their job is to judge, not immediately kill. To give them greater authority, empathy, and tie them closer to the situation, why not make them Vampires as well. To keep the theme of "you have ultimate power but no experience", why not make them new Vampires chosen because they are new, and still mostly human. Their authority and ultimate power could come from some pact between all Vampires. A town could even have a Vampire Steward!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349477">\n<div

that as you spend time as a vampire, you lose more and more of your "human" outlook, and lose touch with your sense of empathy (and other human emotions).<br/><br/>This means that Vampire Hunters who are more experienced and have been around longer are *less* trustworthy: they become twisted, more likely to succumb to monstrous impulses, and more likely to become monsters rather than standing up for justice and the community.<br/><br/>That seems like it would work well with the way the Dogs rules work (you get more powerful and more messed up as you go along) and could make for some very interesting inter-party tension as the Hunters eye each other, looking for signs that someone should be retired from being a Hunter...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
