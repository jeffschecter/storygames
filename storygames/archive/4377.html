There's not much story meat that jumps out at me, but I'll give it a go.<br/><br/>Coalition - Humanities last defenders, the noble and selfless heroes of Earth. Okay, I'm not sure who the black leather and skulls are fooling, but these bastards might serve as a good backdrop.  You could tell a gripping tale of aliens and D-bees living in or around Chi-Town, perhaps they are just trying to scrape a life together, trapped on an alien world, maybe they are working with humans to topple the totalitarian regime.<br/><br/>Whoa, I just realized you could use the Coalition as an enforcement model for <i>Dog Boys in the Vineyard</i>. Rooting out dimensional and magic influence to keep the human race pure.<br/><br/>Tolkeen and other societies - Instead of the "heart of civilization," a story could be set in any of the smaller societies set up around.  Maybe it's something like a post-apocalyptic Camelot (ignoring that the England book actually has a post-apocalypstic Camelot, name and all) full of hope and harmony, or maybe it's more of a Deadwood, where good and bad make alliances of convienience.  Either way, they are surrounded by monsters, threatened by the Coalition, and face internal corruption and betrayal.<br/><br/>Either of these locales could have mega-villains, the alien intelligences from Atlantis, as a threat bigger than the Coalition, for more Epic stuff. It's also an easy jaunt to the Vampires of Mexico.<br/><br/>Even though it was clumsily handled, I liked the Africa setting as well.  You had alien powers that were modelled on the Four Horsemen, with a building threat they were getting ready to unleash hell across the continent, and then the world.  I don't remember too many specifics for more personal story elements.  England was cool, with an evil alien pretending to be Merlin and playing off the Arthur legend to carve out an empire. And there's other cool locations.<br/><br/>Personally, though, I'd stick with the middle of North America, north and south along the Mississippi.  That's the core of the setting.  And maybe its because I was into the game mostly when it first came out, but that feels most like Rifts to me.  A lot of the other locals, especially since I'm sure you'll be using another system, might as well be a whole 'nother game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98803/#Comment_98803" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T18:21:03+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  6:21PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 6:24PM by RichD.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Whoa, I just realized you could use the Coalition as an enforcement model for Dog Boys in the Vineyard.

There's an overall setting (America = Coalition, S. America = Vampire Mad Max, etc), and most setting splats that focus on countries have a page or two of background before the new character classes and guns begin.<br/><br/>All that you would need to story up Rifts is this: Make the goddamned ROGUE SCHOLAR as fun to play as a Techno-Wizard or Dragon Juicer or Coalition Heavy Boy/Glitter Boy. That's all. And then set up a framework that supports it.<br/><br/>Back when I was in HS and all the kids in Glen Ellyn (at least in my scout troop and various circles, when I moved there my Sophomore year) played Rifts, I met a group that showed me the ropes.<br/><br/>The Rogue Scholars sounded AWESOME. I wanted to play one. The GM wanted to have on played. The other players were totally down with it. We were all on board and ready to go.<br/><br/>I got my SDC assault rifle, an MDC knife, and a shitload of skills. I died in the first session. Next session, I had the same dude with a different name: Again, dead. And it wasn't a dick GM or anything: Even watering down the challenges, even me thinking critically and not being all "I'll jump in front of the enemy and ask them politely to stop!" and shit, usually the first round of ammo, SDC or MDC, is the round that ends the Rogue Scholar's life. <br/><br/>Rogue Scientists/Rogue Scholars are like a 100 foot tall frosted glass bauble on the shores of Normandy. They have a half life of "As soon as you're finished making your character".<br/><br/>But they're the most story-ripe fuckers in the whole core book. Just need a system that puts them on even ground.

With 10 attributes, you have some pretty decent flags set up for what the character will be.  You have the basis of social interaction with both your PB (physical beauty)and MA (mental affinity.)<br/><br/>Strangely enough I am working on a Rifter article on just this topic.  I had considered using Aspects, but I think that havings something like a key from TSOY is probably the way to go or even the Passions for Mortal Coil would work well.<br/><br/>I think largely though you are going to have to wrap you players' heads around the idea that conflict is not combat and combat itself is not a series of initiative rolls then to-hit and then dodge or roll or parry, etc. that you are framing scenes and setting stakes in a lot of games.  This makes a lot of the very micro-oriented powers less useful.  In fact it largely renders the powers of the OCCs and RCCs and all of the weapon details as useless.  It really doesn't matter at the end of the day that a weapon can burst for 1D6x10 damage but it takes 4 shots from the E-clip because that's not really what the game is about.  (We ran into this problem playing Shadowrun in the Mortal Coil realm, but that's another post.)<br/><br/>You might play on the fact that unless you are a Coalition citizen living inside of an arcology, you're really can't survive.  The reason there are so many juicers, crazies, glitter boys, etc. is because nature itself has turned on humanity and there are evil D-Bees everywhere.  You have to huddle behind coalition walls or be a badass or some demon and its followers will come and eat you.  End o' story.  I think that makes Coalition Dogs in the Vineyard all that much cooler.<br/><br/>Like Andy said, there is some story meat in all those stats, you just have to look for it.  In fact, many of the NPCs in the books are well thought out with motivations and passions.

But I agree that the core of any story game Rifts has to be: the world is full of powerful creatures that can pulp you without blinking.  How do you react to that?  <br/><br/>I disagree about about making shooting a bad option though.  I never wanted to remove combat from Rifts but make it satisfying in a way that rolling your 6 attacks for 3d6 megadamage never was.  That is always the trick though isn't it?

The idea was to use a different system (maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wushu_%28role-playing_game%29" rel="nofollow">Wushu</a>?) to do it, since the base <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_Books" rel="nofollow">Palladium</a> system is a little... lacking.  It didn't go over, but I'd still like to do it someday.<br/><br/>The pitch:\n<blockquote><b>Death\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Head</b><br/>Humanity is at war with the world that gave birth to it.  Surrounded by enemies both corrupt and alien, the last hope of Earth's true children lies behind a mask of black armor.  Justice comes from the muzzle of a weapon.  Courage is the will to do terrible things in order to avert the unthinkable.<br/><br/>The heroes of <i>Death's Head</i> are dedicated warriors in the service of Emperor Karl Prosek and the Coalition State of Chi-Town.  Armed with the technology of the most advanced human civilization on the planet, and possessed of an unstoppable will to power, they will undertake the tasks no one wants, but which must be done.  Human traitors lurk even in the fortress of Chi-Town itself. The borders of the Coalition States are in constant contact with the twisted spawn of the rifts.<br/><br/>Bravery.  Honor.  Duty.  The Death's Head will win through.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98946/#Comment_98946" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T10:31:29+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 10:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 10:39AM by Denys.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys -- thanks for all your help.

You see this in the Coalition's fascism (anti-magic, anti-DB stance, idea of cleansing areas by killing everything) backed by advanced technology.  You see this in Juicers, Crazies, and Borgs that give up their lives, their sanity, and their humanness for power.<br/><br/>I also see it as a very gang-based game.  If you look at Ramon Perez's iconic Rifts party, it's a bunch of ragtag folks in a old rusty APC traveling through the desert of Old Texas blowing shit up and trying to survive.  It's very Mad Max meets Gorkamorka in that way.  You don't necessarily like the people you run with, but they're family and you can't really abandon them or get away from them.<br/><br/>It's also a game about diversity and how a mixed up bunch of folks can get along.  Can the DBs get along with the humans?  Can the various warring factions of Tolkeen get their act together to keep the Coalition from destroying them all?  Can a Dog Boy, a Mercenary, a Ley Line Walker, and a Mystic Gunslinger all get along together in the same party?<br/><br/>Is that better?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98955/#Comment_98955" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:00:43+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Is that better?</blockquote>\nJonathan -- that rocks.

Even the Mindmelter supercomputer craziness in Nevada thinks it's saving the world.<br/><br/>I think you could get a lot of mileage out of picking a faction (start, say, with Tolkeen) and play out some of their politics and epic struggle to survive and prosper.   Develop their arch-enemies in the Coalition or amongst the Xicotl.  Then, two or three sessions in, new characters, starting with the arch-enemies.  Play them for a little while, then move on.

I suppose I put my own answer as the ultimate conclusion of that scenario, though it's possible (and likely) that the players would come to yours on their own.

Take a gritty gang-war survival/turf struggle thing, and then someone tosses one MDC pistol into the mix.  Suddenly, instead of pulling the trigger and maybe hurting or killing someone, you vaporize the guy, his three buddies, and part of the wall behind him.<br/><br/>Playing all on one side of the SDC/MDC line is hohum.  Level playing field=yawn.  Mix it up.<br/><br/>Take the Rogue Scholar in a typical mess of MDC-armoured and MDC-natural critters party and environment.  But don't make the focus of the adventure on the mcguffin or whatever.  Make the whole frickin' game about keeping the damn Rogue Scholar alive.

But I don't think having these sourcebooks or following the canon is necessary for this.<br/><br/>Ley Ranks is about teenager D-Bees and Humans in Tolkeen in the final months of the siege, as the Coalition stomps over the only home they knew, the only safe place for their kind. It's why their parents settled there after being dumped into this dimension by some random rift. Each scene begins with a psionic broadcast from Radio Mindwave to set the background.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>One of the funky things that always caught my mind in Rifts (and other Palladium stuff, but it shines in Rifts) is the SDC/MDC split.</blockquote>\nI agree that it's a pretty prominent part of the setting.  Although, I think an all "SDC" (normal folks) or all MDC (super-tech and/or powerful dimensional being) games still work just as well.<br/><br/>However, it's also why I'm a fan of the idea of using HQ for Rifts.

And it's totally alien to their nature and culture to even comprehend why this bugs the humans.</blockquote>\nReminds me of John Wick's <i>Orkworld</i>.

They changed a bunch of rules in the Ultimate Edition.  After that, read Rifts: Mercenaries and Rifts: Coalition War if you have it.  Rifts: Africa also has a lot of neat stuff.  Personally, I am thinking about acquiring the War Against Tolkeen and using that as well as the Federation of Magic book.  More than anything find a book that seems interesting to you.  <br/><br/>However, the beauty of game is that all the books boil down to some new OCCs, some big bidass badguys and some flava.  As a GM, if you read something, I can work it in with enough warning.  For instance, if you like the Coalition Navy book, I can shift the game from Chi-Town to the coast pretty easily.  If you like Vampire kingdoms or Atlantis, that's perfectly fine.  <br/><br/>The book that you read and choose an OCC from is actually your character's first flag...:)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99638/#Comment_99638" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T20:04:05+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  8:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
