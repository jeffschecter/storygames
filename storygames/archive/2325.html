                    If only there were some sort of tool which one could use to<br/>generate tabletop relationship maps, <br/><br/>with images designating character roles and<br/>symbols or color codes to indicate rivalries and allegiences<br/><br/>and a quantitative component to represent all sorts of<br/>connective values between the principals, which could<br/>also generate randomized numeric amounts for use in play...<br/>compatible with more than one set of game rules, even...  <br/>So it would be universal like d20 or GURPS<br/><br/>With a drag-and-drop feature so that the nodes could be<br/>added and removed at will, grouped, stacked, and<br/>put into a mode where the information was inaccessible<br/><br/>This amazing tool would require a computer to crunch the<br/>data, of course.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.kardwell.com/images/texan-playing-cards.jpg"/> </div>

                            Hmm. I'm missing the relationship of this subject and those nice wild west playing cards.<br/><br/>While I ponder the amount of work that might actually be involved in implementing this, (I'm actually thinking about it) I want to throw out a counter-idea that occurred to me in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2322&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">other thread</a>. I can't help but think that most of the benefit of creating R-maps comes not from actually having the whiz-bang diagram in front of you, but from the GM mentally working out these relationships in his head in order to get them down into a diagram in the first place. Automation might be defeating the point of the excercise.<br/><br/>Somebody back me up or shoot me down on that.                        </div>

                            Larry, <br/><br/>I know that's how it works for me. <br/><br/>But then I can't run pre-gen Dogs towns worth a damn. If I don't make the town, it doesn't spark off right. Others may be different, but for me it certainly is about the NPCs and their shit coming to life in my brain as I work out their dysfunction.                        </div>

                            Interestingly enough, I had written out a quick draft of a relationship map exercise just a couple weeks ago using playing cards.  I haven't tried it out, but might as well share it to see if you can find any value in it.<br/><br/>FACE CARDS<br/>Represent position or hierarchy of importance.  The person they represent can be of any sex.<br/><br/>Kings = Leaders of a Faction / Primary Instigators of Action;  Kings usually don't share the same Agenda, but may share similar ones.<br/><br/>Queens = Powerful Consorts or Associates;  They help the King but do not necessarily share his Agenda<br/><br/>Jacks = Lieutenants / Insiders; They are subordinates for the King or act in his interest; They share the King's Agenda<br/><br/>Aces = Outsiders / Neutrals; They are initially unaffiliated actors who may or may not be sympathetic to the King but have something he needs or wants.<br/><br/><br/>SUITS<br/>Represent the face card's personality or how they usually attempt to achieve their goals.  The King's suit "colors" how his entire faction operates.<br/><br/>Clubs = Violence, the threat of Violence, or raw action; These people act rather than planning<br/><br/>Diamonds = Intellect; These people plan deeply; May tend to react rather than acting<br/><br/>Hearts = Social Positive; These people employ love, trust, and loyalty to achieve their ends.  They tend to be earnest in their affections.<br/><br/>Spades = Social Negative; These people employ fear, greed, and suspicion to achieve their ends.  They tend to be insincere in their affections.<br/><br/><br/>LAYING OUT THE CARDS<br/>You can use the above structure to lay out a pre-planned relationship map or use the random setup.<br/><br/>Here's where it gets REALLY rough.  I have no idea if this will produce anything of worth.<br/><br/>All Face cards are removed from the deck and shuffled together.  A number of factions, from two to N (logically no more than 5 or 6), are designated and cards are randomly distributed into a like number of piles.<br/><br/>These represent not just the factions but also can represent physical grouping.<br/><br/>If there is a single king in a pile, he controls this faction unambiguously.  Any Queens in the pile may either share the King's agenda, be neutral towards it, or be working against (usually indirectly).  Any jacks are the Kings lieutenants.  If there share his suit, they are even more zealous than he.  If they have a different suit, they have a more moderate position than he.  If they share a suit with the Queen, they are sympathetic to her, and may be persuaded to serve her agenda.  If there are Aces in the pile, they are outsides or neutrals partially under the King's control who have something he needs or wants to fulfill his goal.  They also represent this to at least one other King in another pile.<br/><br/>If there are multiple Kings in a pile, they are either all after the same goal (and control is contested of this faction) or they are after different goals (and represents a physically co-located group with different aims).  Divide any non-Kings in the pile randomly between them (this does not have to be equal).  Each King possesses something the other directly needs or wants - this could be one of his subordinates.<br/><br/>If there are no Kings in the pile but there are Queens, this faction appears to be assisting another faction in its goal, but is not as zealous.  It may have a secondary goal, or be covertly acting against the faction it appears to assist.  Multiple Queens mean a faction with no single leader.  There are multiple agendas within this faction, not all of them likely compatible.  Any Jacks in this pile serve the Queen(s) and Aces within this pile are partially within the Queen(s)' control.<br/><br/>If their are no Kings in the pile but there are Aces, this faction is effectively neutral and members could be swayed to another faction.  Usually this faction represents a vulnerable goal of multiple Kings.  Any Jacks in this pile serve the Ace.<br/><br/>If there are only Jacks in the pile, distribute these randomly and evenly to the remaining piles.  They assume a role in the faction they become a member of, possibly of recent provenance.<br/><br/><br/>I don't know if it will work, and you'll have to establish what the goals and relationships are.  But it represents factions and their general patterns of behavior reasonably well.  Feel free to ignore it or make what use of it you can with my best wishes.                        </div>

                            CURLY'S CARD MAP v1.01<br/> This process a relationship map from a standard deck of playing cards.<br/><br/>INSTRUCTIONS:<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck, and draw from it, placing the drawn cards face-up in a first pile, called a "Castle".<br/><br/>If you get any numbered cards (#'s) just place each # on the Castle pile and keep drawing until you get to a face card (including Jokers &amp; Aces).<br/><br/>If you start by drawing a face-card, or when you eventually reach a face-card; place it on the pile, as well.  In the illustration below, the first castle has a King on top.<br/><br/>If the next card is also a face card, it goes on the same pile.  Same with more faces, UNTIL you reach another number.  Hold that # aside for a moment.<br/><br/>The castle you have just made is a stack of game currency of various types (suits, colors, number-value) which are associated with the face card (or cards) on top: aka  NPCs.  Face cards with no #'s below control no currency.  Royalty without wealth.<br/><br/>Now-- back to that last # you are holding aside.  Count clockwise around the corners of the castle, starting at top right corner; up to the number on the card.<br/>So, if the numbered card is a 7, then Top Right = 1, Bottom Right = 2, Bottom Left = 3, and so on... until 7 = Bottom Left again.  Place the # at that corner. (So the 7's upper right corner touches the Bottom Left of the Castle.     You are building a 2nd castle now, on top of the 7.<br/><br/>Continue to draw cards, as with the 1st castle, piling #'s on top, if any, and then piling faces on top, until you get another #.   Hold the # aside again, and admire the 2nd castle you've built.<br/><br/>Again count clockwise around the corners of the 2nd castle, up the value of the # you are holding again-- to determine where to place the 3rd castle.<br/>EXCEPT, you skip over any corners which already have a castle adjacent.   So you'd skip the Top Right of Castle 2, and start counting at the Bottom Right.<br/><br/>And-- this is different from before--now that you have more than one castle, you are counting around the outside corners of All The Castles On The Table*.<br/>Still stopping at whatever corner matches the # showing, and building the next castle there.  (The 2nd castle would be in the "A" location, in the illo below)<br/><br/>In the illustration below, 3 castles have been built (the black cards)-- and the next number card drawn is a 9.  The most recent castle was the one with the<br/>Queen on top, so the numbers show how to Count Around Clockwise, up to nine, and where to place the 9 card (the grey location).<br/>Note which card corners were not counted-- because a card was already adjacent there. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d45/icyicd/CurlysCardMapillo.gif"/><br/><br/>Keep going until you run out of cards.  If you end on a face card, the whole map will be occupied castles.  <br/>But if you end on a numbered card, there will be some uncontrolled wealth in that pile.  An unguarded castle.<br/><br/>My trial run yielded 13 castles.  With an intriguing array of occupants.  One castle consists of 2 jokers on a big pile of number cards.<br/>One end of the map is all castles with Queens on top.  In middle-- connecting everything-- are 2 Jacks, each sitting on only a single 6.<br/><br/>The task which remains is to apply mechanics and a narrative scenario to the map you've created.  The card associations Flynn offered above would work well.                        </div>

                            In City of Masks, I use a very simple card-based system to create an R-map.<br/><br/>Denomination is how strong the relationship is: A is a mild liking or dislike, 10 is obsessive devotion or hatred.<br/><br/>Red cards are positive relationships and black cards are negative relationships.<br/><br/>Heart and club relationships are "fickle" and diamond and spade relationships are "enduring". This determines whether, when the strength of the relationship changes in the course of the game, it happens gradually or all at once after a certain number of points have been built up.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you do card draws and (freely) assign cards on your character sheet to each of the other PCs and to four factions. This determines your character's starting relationship with those characters and factions.                        </div>
