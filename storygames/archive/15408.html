Having a limited role can be fine if a game is really short and maybe players take turns handling the less-fun aspects, but obviously it's better if all players can be fully engaged in the game (even if their engagement takes radically different forms) and if all the players have the potential for roughly equal enjoyment (again, even if that enjoyment takes different forms).  When I see a possibly vestigial GM role in a game, I often suspect that the game would be better without a GM at all, but maybe the designer doesn't feel fully comfortable in their ability to design such a game or worries that the game needs an authority figure to keep it on the rails and make sure it hangs together.  Neither of those demonstrates much confidence and ambition, I think, and I would recommend that designers push past that, as their games and their design abilities will probably improve by overcoming that challenge.<br/><br/>The second and more complicated problem is relatively <b>shallow GM-lessness</b>, where a designer has <i>not</i> (A) come up with a game structure and premise that doesn't require a GM <i>but instead</i> (B) started from the standpoint of designing a game with a GM... <i>and then excised the GM</i> by either (1) distributing those responsibilities among the players or (2) using a "rotating GM" setup where those responsibilities move about the group during play.  The reason that this is a more complicated problem is that, as far as I can tell, <i>most notable GM-less games (Polaris, Fiasco, etc.) seem to have started from Option B rather than Option A</i>, at least at some point in their design history.  That is to say, most designers still begin designing new games using their years of expectations from GM'ed play as their foundation for design.  Only rarely do I encounter games that, from the outset, were designed without the assumption that GM-like responsibilities would have to be performed by someone, either a semi-traditional GM or distributed/rotating responsibilities. However, I think this is something we can and will gradually move beyond, but it will take some work.  Many Nordic-influenced games are leading the way in this regard (Montsegur 1244 does not assume there will be GM responsibilities anywhere, for example), but there are other examples more "indigenous" to the Anglo-American-Canadian indie games tradition, such as some of Jackson Tegu's games.  In addition, there's still extensive room for progress on the Option B side, where designers really take GM-lessness and bake it into the core principles and mechanics of their games, rather than simply layering GM-like responsibilities on top.  The more successful GM-less games (including Polaris, Fiasco, etc.) don't make you wish that there was still a GM, don't make you feel that it would all be simpler and more elegant without all this distributed/rotating business. But we can still go further, I think, working against our own design tendencies and assumptions from a lifetime of GMs.<br/><br/>Anyway, just wanted to bring those issues up and keep them in people's minds. GM-less play isn't something that we've figured out.  What we've discovered is just the tip of the iceberg and there's a lot more to come below it, but it won't get revealed on its own and we have to keep digging to see the rest of it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349618/#Comment_349618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T10:53:10+00:00" title="November 24, 2011 10:53AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey JW, interesting division, but I'm not sure what games to fit into what category.<br/><br/>Like, PTA has a similar-to-a-GM position in the Producer, whose job it is to play NPCs, set scenes and bid against the players in conflicts, pretty much everything a GM does except "say what happens" and "create the campaign".

It's a narration-heavy, rules light, conflict resolution system with a rotating Lead Narrator who also plays a character, with a play order of LN, next player's character, next ... , LN's character last.  The LN's position rotates to the right after each scene.  The rules even admit that you can have a fixed LN player if you really want to, although there is some effort spent making sure the LN's role is not too onerous, in the form of pre-made "mission briefs".    Mind you, it looks like a perfectly fine game, but I don't see it as particularly GM-less.  <br/><br/>I do find myself wondering how well this rotating GM approach works if the group contains one or more players who have no interest in being the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349642/#Comment_349642" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T21:16:40+00:00" title="November 24, 2011  9:16PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if your D&amp;D group has no players who are interested in being the DM, it probably won't do so well either...<br/><br/>I donno, I mean, I'm nodding along, yeah, a game that defines a role in a bad way or doesn't make it interesting is not going to succeed...I didn't think this was a Thing That Was Happening any more than, say, screwing up probability and asking people to roll dice that don't make sense?

To me it still feels like we're in the early days of exploring GM-less design, so it's a bit difficult to think of games that start from a completely GM-free place.  The one that immediately comes to mind is Jackon's Stage One game <a href="http://fallaway.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/differences-port.pdf" rel="nofollow">Differences</a>, which is striking in how different the social setup is, but I think you can still conceivably have a more traditional RPG premise and still start from a place where you don't assume GM-like responsibilities.<br/><br/><b>Josh:</b> Certainly there are other alternatives! There's every other possible setup imaginable! We've just been trained to think of stories in terns of protagonists + opposition and divide things up that way in our heads. Even the kinds of stories we think are appropriate for RPGs are constrained to the ones that fit a GM-player(s) model. For example, it was interesting in reading the Stage One games to see how many designers took single-player video games and tried to make them work for 4-5 players, the traditional standard for RPGs. Why are we still stuck in the "party of characters" mindset? The GM-player thing is similar and just as deeply ingrained.<br/><br/>One thing that helps me, I think, is trying to take stories that I don't think are especially well-designed for a traditional RPG setup and imagining how to make them work at the table. That helps me reconsider my expectations. So say... music videos. If I wanted to make a game that feels like the video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P4A1K4lXDo&amp;ob=av2e" rel="nofollow">Michael Jackson's "Scream"</a>, having a GM just seems stupid, right? That authority setup isn't at all suggested by the arrangement of forces in the fiction.  And then sometimes I can take that perspective with me when I examine fictions that more closely resemble traditional RPG setups.  Like, say, The Matrix.  You have a party of individuals on a ship fighting against an alien outside force, which sounds very much like a traditional RPG.  But there's also no reason that the player responsible for the machines or events in the matrix has to also have authority over situations in the real world or play other humans.  I mean, the machines may not even have a player at all, because they could be automated through the mechanics, since their desires are straightforward and logical.<br/><br/>I don't have a great set of solutions here, obviously, because I struggle with these issues myself.  Geiger Counter and Metrofinal both show signs of me struggling to deepen the GM-lessness and not being satisfied with simply distributing traditional GM responsibilities, but they're not as developed in that regard as I eventually want them to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349667/#Comment_349667" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T10:03:56+00:00" title="November 25, 2011 10:03AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I'm picking up what you're putting down.<br/><br/>It's critical we dismantle the notion of the heroic auteur as a lone writer, director, or whatever. Even novelists need editors, agents and confidantes. Films take hundreds of people to come together. It's extremely rare that that a work of art is the product of a single person. Often, I feel as if the dominate metaphor of RPGs is that of theatre cum sporting, with a script, actors and a director; and multiple antagonistic players and an arbiter. But really, it's much closer to improv, which is non-competitive (even if it's antagonistic within the fiction) and rarely has any kind of arbitration beyond the rules stated in the promp. <br/><br/>In my thinking, it's much more interesting to have each player antagonize each other and protagonize whatever elements or characters they might be responsible for. <br/><br/>Which is to say: it's anarchy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349669/#Comment_349669" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T10:41:26+00:00" title="November 25, 2011 10:41AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Nathan:</b> The improv model is certainly an interesting one, but it's not the only way forward worth considering.

Personally I think that a GMless game-in-a-week is harder to do well, so from my POV entrants choosing that path are doing it for other reasons.<br/><br/>I think most/all of my games fall into JWalt's category B, but rather than frame it as an issue of excision I'd frame it as an issue of redistribution of authority. The stuff a GM does needs to get done, but who should do it and when?

Where does Capes fit into this model? It doesn't really fit either of the thread title categories, in my opinion. I find it to be a fantastic GM-less game. Antagonism is provided by your fellow players, authority is determined by resource allocation, and resources are gathered by creating interesting antagonism. My complaint is that it could have a little more crunch, that the characters could use a little more real differentiation (related to crunch), and the real narrative punch never materialized for me like it did in say, DitV. I have a suspicion that this is directly related to both characters and situation. If one were to take a DitV situation and characters, it seems to me that a somewhat similarly narratively punchy game could be had by using Capes to run it. Not to take away from the DitV resolution mechanics, but it is the character creation and town creation rules that make the difference between DitV and Capes for me.<br/><br/>Continuing my stream of consciousness post, GM-less games have been interesting to me, but have never really had the narrative impact for me as GMed games precisely because the situation and characters have not had the same punchiness as the GMed games contain. Lady Blackbird practically runs itself sometimes, DitV can run itself sometimes, TSOY can run itself sometimes, I have thought many times that In a Wicked Age should be a GM-less game already, and each of those games has created some serious stories with amazing narrative impact. These games could, under your definitions, be almost called Vestigial GM Games. The primary job of the GM in these games is to create and then present the situation, and at times provide antagonism. When the players create the antagonism themselves, that just leaves creation and presentation of the situation as the job of the GM. In Lady Blackbird, the situation is given to you with the game, so some structure to do what GM-less games do to create antagonism would mostly eliminate the need for a GM. In some games of DitV I have played, the players actually created more antagonism than the GM, and the GMs job was just to create and present the situation, then the party blew up and shot each other in the face. In a Wicked Age helps you create a great situation, and antagonism is often provided by other players, so I have felt many times that I was closer to a player when I was a GM than I was to a traditional GM in other games.<br/><br/>Here would be a fun experiment. Take Lady Blackbird. Dump the rules and play it with Capes. Likely to be a fantastic adventure game, no GM required. Situation from LB, antagonism and authority from Capes.<br/><br/>As an alternative, create a situation with In a Wicked Age (situation). Play it with Remember Tomorrows turn taking rules (authority, antagonism). For added punch, use the DitV character creation and resolution rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349678/#Comment_349678" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-25T13:20:31+00:00" title="November 25, 2011  1:20PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Matthijs:</b> Definitely.

I could give a shit that 'vestigial' and 'shallow' are pejorative terms. They get the point across.  But, I do suspect the pejorative connotations are indicative of how Jonathan views the game shelf:  the stuff he likes is good, and the stuff he dislikes is bad.  <br/><br/>Same with the psychopathology diagnoses he offers: the designers Jonathan likes exemplify \u2018huge progress\u2019 and \u2018deserve credit\u2019. The ones he doesn\u2019t like have \u2018issues\u2019, \u2018don\u2019t feel fully comfortable\u2019, \u2018need an authority figure\u2019, lack \u2018much confidence and ambition\u2019, and their \u2018design abilities\u2019 need to \u2018improve\u2019 beyond their \u2018tendancies and assumptions\u2019. Open and shut case, no need for discussion.  Which is what bugs me: if everything's already so neatly sorted, then what's the point of further discussion-forum discussion?  Especially since Jonathan's views are so in-keeping with indie orthodoxy:  we =could= all just pat ourselves on the back for agreeing with him.  But, what good purpose would that serve?<br/><br/>Second, there's the Fiasco Test.

If this need is fulfilled by the players, these games have the potential to be more personal and accepting of fragility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349699/#Comment_349699" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T02:23:52+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  2:23AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Blackrat and I were discussing similarish themes last night, and ended up agreeing[*]that in order for GMly power to be distributed amongst the players or, if you prefer, absent from any one individual, you need some pretty clear guidelines on who can do what. Our experience has been that some games (I'm thinking of Fiasco, though it isn't the only one) leave room for doubt in the mind of the players as to who can do what.<br/><br/>For example<br/>- Who can define facts about the world outside of the current situation, if anyone? If the answer is "nobody can", then how do such facts come to be known? Purely by implication? Who is allowed to create in-game events that imply the existence of facts outside of the current situation?<br/>- Who can define facts about the current situation?<br/>- Who decides how each character in a scene acts?<br/>- Who decides how conflicts between characters turn out?<br/>- What happens if two people who are both allowed to do one of the above things disagree?<br/><br/>Now, clearly it's possible to proceed without answering these questions and just kind of roll with it and hopefully everything is ok. But we have found that, in the absence of an agreed culture of who-does-what (classically, "the GM does most of those things, the players just control their characters, and the game mechanics arbitrate disputes", but there can be and are other ways of doing it), and lacking clear guidance from the game system itself, great uncertainty and lack of confidence are created. Exciting creative opportunities are missed, because players are unclear what their scope for action is.<br/><br/>So anyway, back to my original point, which is that there need to be answers to all the above questions in a given game, and explicit guidance answering each of them is a good idea. I suspect, but don't know, that the phenomena referred to of vestigial/shallow GMlessness are connected to the fact that such guidance is not always present.<br/><br/>[*] Blackrat isn't here, but I'm totally using my GM-authority to say that he agrees.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349701/#Comment_349701" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T03:52:21+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  3:52AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading Johnathan more charitably, I do like the un-orthodoxy of him saying that it can be shrewd leave-out seemingly-necesssary bits; not merely an error.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349702/#Comment_349702" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T05:19:40+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  5:19AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rabalias</cite>Our experience has been that some games (I'm thinking of Fiasco, though it isn't the only one) leave room for doubt in the mind of the players as to who can do what.</blockquote>\nDon't rule out ambiguity as a conscious design choice.

But I have found that the ambiguity can cause some problems, with resonate in my mind with the whole "shallow GMlessness" thing. Maybe I'm not explaining myself very well here - I think that the GM + party of players paradigm is quite well understood and as a result there are strong shared conventions about how you "do" roleplaying within that paradigm. I think the Fiasco paradigm is less well understood (by me at least!) and so the conventions aren't there. Which means there can be some unreliability inherent in play. I say this because I think that with experience, conventions will arise, which aren't the same as GM + party of players, but which answer some of the questions I posed above. The absence of such conventions in the design seem to me to be something to do with what is meant by "shallow GMlessness".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349713/#Comment_349713" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T09:30:41+00:00" title="November 26, 2011  9:30AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so there's this thing that often happens when people bring up concerns in the indie games community -- really, anything that could be considered criticism of indie games and creators -- and it seems like it runs the risk of happening here: it's unclear who or what exactly is being criticized (and, to be honest, my initial post is intentionally unclear on that, because pointing fingers just makes it worse) and people seem to panic that maybe I'm criticizing a game or playstyle they actually like or am being unfair in my criticism.  And then people sometimes line up on either side -- for or against the criticism -- and the discussion gets kinda polarized. I'm prepared for that, because that's par for the course in these kinds of threads, but it'd be nice if we could head that off a bit.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that to ward off any criticism of my initial post. Folks are welcome to disagree with what I said or how I said it (which could definitely have been better). I'm just trying to inspire some reflection on how GM-less design is proceeding.  This is all subjective, right?  Especially deciding if a GM is "vestigial" or if the GM-lessness of a certain game is "shallow" or "deep."  If this thread causes you to think about those issues the next time you play or design a game, then, great; that's the whole point.<br/><br/>If we want to continue this discussion in a more productive way, Lee is probably right that it's important to get more concrete about specific games and practices.  I suggest, though, that instead of framing things in terms like "Game X has shallow GM-lessness!" (labeling), we frame things like "how could we make the GM-lessness of Game X deeper and more fundamental?" or "how would this game look if it didn't assume that traditional GM duties would have to be performed by someone?"  I realize that the intentionally provocative wording of the opening post might make that more difficult and I apologize for getting negative terms stuck in everybody's minds.<br/><br/>Is it possible to have a productive conversation on this now, or should we just spin some of these ideas off into new threads?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349719/#Comment_349719" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-26T10:04:00+00:00" title="November 26, 2011 10:04AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even if it is perjorative, that's okay with me.

I always have great fun creating characters (Pathways and the relationship/campaign map it generates are that game's killer app), and I loved running it the first time, but the last two games I've GMed have been very unsatisfying and I've been trying to put my finger on why.  <br/><br/>On paper, the Smallville GM isn't any more vestigial than any trad-leaning RPG-- you have the ability to make NPCs come and go, you can call for characters to make rolls any time you feel like with any sort of stakes and consequences, and you're also the only one with explicit authority to frame and end scenes (though some PC abilities step on this, like the time I ended a scene with three characters chained up in an alien starship choking on knockout gas-- a dramatic cliffhanger that got hilariously deflated as all three immediately used their "join a scene in progress" powers to escape offscreen and join their other buddy back at the dorms.  Now, that was hilarious at the time and totally appropriate in a Buffy kinda way, but still worth noting).  But the setup and general game premise is so laser-focused not just on the PCs, but specifically their relationships to one another (to the point that the bulk of the game's GM advice stresses that the primary use of NPCs is as tools to strain and illuminate intraparty relationships), that it's very easy for the GM to feel shut out of things.  <br/><br/>I think this was the real problem with those last couple games I had-- as GM, I did not have a character to create, so I didn't have any real input in the settings that came out of character creation, and they ended up going in directions that didn't enthuse me, so while the players were having tons of fun I felt kinda disengaged, and a little put-off watching everyone else having so much more fun than I did.  So this might be a case of the GM being marginalized not so much by explicit rules, as the general premise of the game.  "Premise" isn't really the word I'm looking for-- "social contract" is closer, but this isn't so much the OOC rules the group has arrived at, as the... uh, context the rules are written in and meant to be used?  "Genre" isn't what I want either.  There has to be some terminology for this... <br/><br/>Mm, think I rambled there, but this has been on my mind for quite a while now and thinking out loud helped me put some things together.  Smallville is definitely a game whose player focus, and lack of focus on the GM's role as anything but a foil for the players, has a strong risk of making the GM vestigial if you don't realize that going in and make sure you're just as invested in the characters and setting as the players are.  This may also possibly be a (solved?) problem with PTA, but believe it or not I have never read or played that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349931/#Comment_349931" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T11:48:48+00:00" title="November 29, 2011 11:48AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that more discussion of specific games will be more helpful here (kind of like the Forgean call to "post about Actual Play or shut up!").<br/><br/>JWalt, what does "vestigial" GMing feel like? Do you have some real examples?<br/><br/>In my experience, even games where many GMing duties are off-loaded onto the players (so to speak) still leave SO MUCH for a GM to do, that's it hard to imagine that player feeling like they're not needed or not having a chance to participate. (However, Joe, just above this post, seems to agree with you that this is a thing, so I'd love to hear more about that!)<br/><br/>Like... the Apocalypse World MC is a "quasi-GM"? Really? I don't understand where this is coming from: to me, the AW MC is one hell of a strong authority, in a very classical sense.<br/><br/>Here's a thing, though:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Don't rule out ambiguity as a conscious design choice. At least in Fiasco the things you have no guidance on are as deliberate as the things you are very specifically told how to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>I like what Matthijs was saying, about how not telling who to do what usual-GM-duties can lead to us talking it out. Better communication.</blockquote>\nI can see some parallels between different "traditions" of gaming (or design cultures), and how they each demand that the group re-define the grey area in a particular game in order to play it successfully.<br/><br/>For instance, in many "traditional" games, there was very little sense of how to actually structure scenes/plot. Maybe the players were given direction on how to create characters, and the GM was given lots of guidance on world-building. But now what? How does this static thing turn into a dynamic Story at the table? Each group effectively needed to create their own solution to this question. Does the GM construct a set-piece "adventure" and guide the players through it? Or do the characters' goals drive play?<br/><br/>In the similar way, a game like Fiasco makes it very clear where "story" comes from, but leaves open the issue of authority distribution among the group. Each group effectively needs to create their own sense of organization: who says what when, who has the final say on a given question, etc. Do we all frame scenes together, or does one person tend to take charge and "direct" a given scene? Does a Resolving player have full say in a scene's outcome, or is it negotiated through freeform roleplaying and basic improv principles (like "Say Yes, But...")?<br/><br/>It's a kind of "fruitful void", but for matters of System: what makes this thing go? And whose job is it to do that?<br/><br/>A related question: have you ever played a game that you felt didn't leave enough of that kind of space, left out the grey area and thereby limited its own success?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349955/#Comment_349955" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T14:39:12+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  2:39PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2011 2:57PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/><br/>Like... the Apocalypse World MC is a "quasi-GM"?

I wouldn't call the MC a weak role per se, but it is a very reactive one-- I mean, you're supposed to spend the entire first session literally reacting to the players, and basically doing the Mountain Witch Trick whenever they ask a question.  AW has a lot more call-and-response between players and GM than Smallville, which foregrounds the MC a lot more than Watchtower (and it also encourages the MC to make long-term plans in the form of Fronts), but I can see a lot of similarity between the two.<br/><br/>Actually it's kind of funny-- I HATE the post-apocalypse as a genre, bored silly by it in pretty much any medium, to the point where my mind turns blank even trying to think of ideas (Deadlands Hell on Earth kinda worked for me because it stressed the commonalities with Westerns), but since the MC can be done almost on autopilot by riffing on the players and tossing in hard moves when they fail a roll, I can run AW just fine.  I actually have more trouble PLAYING AW than running it because it assumes the players will be the primary source of creativity.<br/><br/>Now I'm sort of morbidly curious to see if that Mythic GM Emulator thing could actually run AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349972/#Comment_349972" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-29T15:57:12+00:00" title="November 29, 2011  3:57PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville's GMing relies a LOT on coming up with compelling (to you) NPCs and playing them hard towards their goals, which, because you designed them right, are stepping on the relationships of the PCs. Joe is right, if you don't have bold NPCs ready to come in and charge after something, there's not much to do there.

While taking out responsabilities from one player and distributing it among all participants seems to be the way to go, most of the solutions to this either reveal the plot twists too early to allow players enjoy discovering them, or leave players to build a story without enough coherence to make any other genre but comedy, unless they all are used to collaborate in writing stories.<br/><br/>Now, it's not that you can't have fun with those games, or even make them do what you want withouth hacking the system; it's just that most of them won't fully work with a group of players where at least one of them has some experience at GMing, and some crucial rules are so open to players interpretation that the temptation of crashing the game on purpose can become too strong for players that put their fun before the fun of the group.<br/><br/>I've heard it before, that's the player's fault, but a system with too many holes is a magnet for players like this, so I prefer to do my best to prevent the issue.<br/><br/>Well, solutions I've come up (actually hacked down) so far:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-Hack of the Whimsy cards, poker-like version.</span> Genre and  main elements of the story are defined in 10 minutes before playing, then players propose scenes and challenges to each other in turns, however challenges are restricted to anything that uses the phrases/ concepts from the cards. To answer the challenge, players says yes or rolls the dice. On the first turn players use one card from their hand to state a challenge, the number increases each turn, so the game ends when a player has no cards left. There's a mechanic for making an epilogue after the last challenge is dealt with.<br/><br/>Pros: quick to learn, story scalates pretty well in all testings done, player crativity gets a help from the cards and everybody can suggest things, so the game hardly stalls at all. Defining genre and story elements in the preparating stage helps keeping coherence of the story. Even when throwing crap in the system, the game keeps going and the story keeps escalating, though the genre inevitably turns into comedy. It makes for a good short game (2 to 3 hours long using all cards, number of cards used can be reduced to shorten the session)<br/><br/>Cons: first time players have to pass through a 5 minute process of adaptation. Though it can be a bit awkward for players with no experience in RPGs, everybody gets the hang of it in a while. The game starts on collaborative mode but can turn into competitive mode quite soon, with players setting ridiculous challenges to each other. However, since there's no clear winner (the player who ends up with no cards sooner can call for the conclusion, but that just ends the game. The one with the best story can be the winner in the eyes of the group, but that's so abstract that you can't have rules for that.) the ending of the game doesn't feel competitive at all. The game can't be used for long campaings. In challenges where the life of the PCs are at stake, since the mechanics state that PCs can't die until the concusion scene, it's kind of strange to see PCs defy death until the very end of the story. The story twists can also be quite exxagerated for some players, and the way it's done, it doesn't allow any player to have narrative control for longer than one turn of the game. This makes frustrating trying to send the story in one way or another at will, but if you learn to let it go, you can actually get to enjoy the results.<br/><br/><br/>Since the previous example still doesn't feel like an RPG to me (perhaps I'm seeking too much to recreate the feeling players get from trad games) what I'm trying now goes around these lines:<br/>shortened hack of burning wheel for the setting, players define the objective of their characters and their relationship to each other, main threats and hopes are defined and then a competitive storytelling game begins. Players strate the next step in the sory of their characters, ther rest of the player add the obstacles, player says yes or rolls the dice. Turn of the next player and so it goes. To aid player input I'm using a sort of "apples to aples" cards, where you take three random cards to help you describe any obstacle, place, character or item the PCs find in their way. Perhaps I'll recycle again the whimsy cards for complicating the challenges and trigger the mechanism for character growth, allowing PCs to even change their initial objective according to the story they build ingame.<br/><br/>what solutions would you apply to make a GMless game actually GMless?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350167/#Comment_350167" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-01T13:08:11+00:00" title="December  1, 2011  1:08PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>... the temptation of crashing the game on purpose can become too strong for players that put their fun before the fun of the group.</blockquote>\nYeah, don't play with these guys.

These games, of course started out with a GM and then kind of segued into (or were specifically moved into) a (though creatively productive) tyranny of gmlessness. We relied on discussion, discussion, discussion, about world and plot to move forward. And there were people all the time holding responsibility for bringing surprises and plot twists. <br/><br/>Having rules and structures is a lot easier than finding friends who will commit to this kind of thing. Dealing with folks who are intentionally obstructive would be the death knell I am sure.<br/><br/>Also, re: vestigial GMs. The referee in a Matrix Engle game, per se has that kind of a stripped down responsibility (basically they just adjudicate relative difficulties in mechanical resolution). I believe the rest of the support (world, plot, characters etc.) is in the game &amp; game materials with Matrix games. Lovingly crafted by Chris.

I also think that going minimalistic doesn't mean leaving players with all the work of designing a whole book of rules to adjust the game to the way they play, bad behavior or not.<br/><br/>I'just keep finding RPGs that i'd love to play, but when I see the ruleset I often find the designer thought it would be played by the best group of writers/actors/best friends4ever, instead of human people looking for fun, prone to misinterpretate things to their favor, break the game for fun and disagree. It's different than ruling against bad behavior, perhaps some designers will find it restrictive, but I do believe RPGs designed this way would provide a better player experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350692/#Comment_350692" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-06T11:59:03+00:00" title="December  6, 2011 11:59AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Jason's<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/gmless/gmless_02.pdf" rel="nofollow">players at the table model</a>doesn't spell out the how/what/why</blockquote>\nThis looks cool.<br/><br/>Is there an explanation of what this all means somewhere?

Other players may try to replace it or modify it with "challenges". The first player and the challenger roll dice to see who wins. The high roller wins, re-roll ties. Players get to challenge once per turn.<br/><br/>Every player gets to start a turn per scene, so you go around the table once. <br/><br/>At the end of the third scene the game ends.<br/><br/>The host's job is to keep things moving and make certain players have a good time. That's all that remains of the GM role. <br/><br/>So far the playtests have been going well. I'm hopeful that I'll have this out as a commercial game next year. The working title now is "Snapshot: 1969" cos it has a 60's theme. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I don't think there is anything wrong with using GMs. I like to run the occasional traditional RPG but not for very long. GMing is really hard work. As a design mechanic it puts a lot of stress on one point of the machine. If that part fails (for any reason) the machine grinds to a halt and crashes. GM games also rely on a lot of expertise in one player. That is asking a lot. It's just what Kriegspiel did two hundered years ago. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Vestigial GMs and Shallow GM-Lessness - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15408/vestigial-gms-and-shallow-gm-lessness/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Vestigial GMs and Shallow GM-Lessness - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15408/vestigial-gms-and-shallow-gm-lessness/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="where can I find methods to get players to the sweet spot?

Could there be any way to design a gmless system to help players get there? Is there already a GMless game able to get there?<br/><br/>BTW, Chris, I already tried a game like that, though I used a hack of the whimsy cards to help players provide the challenges, as well as introduce elements in the fiction. You can add some simple mechanics to indicate who starts and something to reward players for keeping things moving; so you can remove the "game host" from the equation. Unless that role is actually fun to play and not just a safeguard to keep the game from stalling.<br/><br/>One of the problems I stumbled upon with that design was PCs death. In the end I had to rule out PCs could only die in the conclussion scene, depite of the situation they got dragged into by the other players or how bad their rolls were. In the worst case we translated it into slow-motion scenes, with the PCs still doing things to avoid their inminent death.<br/><br/>I'm still working in a mechanic to help players come up with creative input in the spot, in order to take out creative responsability from a single player and not having players design all the content before actually starting playing, since I don't wanna ruin the element of surprise that players get with each turn the story takes as a result of their actions.<br/><br/>But my design also has a bit of a truble with coherence. The story the testers produced was fast paced and the more competitive we got, the more the story suffered the consequences, giving no pause to any character. There were certain guidelines, however the natural limit of the game was about two and a half hours of gameplay and absolutely no chance of runing a long campaign with it. There was a limit to competitiveness, since the game didn't revolve around that and the worse challenges you stated, the worse it came back to you in the end, so even those who wanted to break the game had trouble going too far with their intentions. On top of that no matter what king of garbage you fed the system with (you could come up with any setting at the beginning of the game) the twists and turns of the story and the challenges kept the game going.<br/><br/>I'll make another test of this system this weekend, if you're interested you can check the outline of the rules here:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iXnAIDMtaPpZX375EJbDcGvtxJ29Rh4l7BlFd-6FwU/edit?authkey=CJ6IgOoI&amp;hl=en_US#" rel="nofollow">Aventuras Epicas</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350794/#Comment_350794" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T13:03:43+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  1:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the best tools for getting everyone in the sweet spot are social rather than procedural overall. <br/><br/>One thing I'm proud of in Fiasco is the way that the option to resolve a scene takes pressure off of relentless creativity, allowing somebody to sit back for a moment and let others do the heavy lifting.

I feel like I might have some pretty fundamental disagreements with that.<br/><br/>Isn't leaving the distribution of authority up to the group mostly a common alternative to procedural distribution due to the lack of tradition and clarity of roles in GM-less play?  Like, many games don't have to explain the details of the GM-player relationship because we have years of history behind that (though some games, like AW, have admirably tried and, I think, pushed our collective understanding forward).  But, faced with having to procedurally explain GM-less models, when we don't even really have a developed language for talking about that, it's easier and maybe even more successful to let people try to "find the sweet spot" through reliance on strong existing social bonds, listening, and adaptation, using that as the basis of your game rather than imposing a new system of social relations.<br/><br/>If that is the case, then, it's not that the best <i>possible</i> tools are social rather than procedural, but that we may not have yet assembled a set of procedural tools that are more elegant and consistent than just relying on strong social bonds between the players and a spirit of listening and flexibility.  In the future, I suspect that the best systems -- as in many other aspects of game design -- will be hybrids of strict procedures and "fruitful voids" where the existing social relations between the players or some improvized solution is used.

That's just talking in character's voices, chiming in details about what's going on in the scene, mostly color stuff but some stuff that other people will choose to riff on.<br/><br/>It's my turn. I can either choose to set up the scene, which is to say, "do above-normal creative work now",<br/>or i can let the two of you set up the scene, which means i'll be ending the scene; in that case, i'll be doing my "above-normal creative work" at that point.<br/><br/>The fact that i get to decide when i'm gonna kick into a higher creative gear is freeing,<br/>and what's more freeing is the sitting-back-and-enjoying while you guys take your turn in higher creative gear, because that's the contract that we've agreed to with the game - we get clearly delineated breaks. And after my turn, it'll be yours, say; then you get to pick when you want your break.<br/>[edit: and by "breaks", i mean brief pauses. Not like, "let's make a sandwich", just the momentary pause to catch your breath while i'm holding the floor.]<br/><br/>When Jason says "deer in the headlights", i think of the moment when i'm sitting there in the hotseat, everyone looking at me &amp; i'm drawing a blank.<br/>This usually occurs in games after a jump ahead (sure, jackson. Citation needed.), when we're starting to establish a new scene. <br/>What should happen? What would be really awesome or poignant? Well, Fiasco seeks to give a way around that by offering that person (the one in the headlights) a chance to wrap things up instead of start things off.<br/><br/>That's how i see that particular joy with Fiasco.<br/><br/><br/>Jonathan, yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350881/#Comment_350881" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T03:47:59+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  3:47AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JWalt, I'm right there with you.

(That's an actual question; I'm not 100% sure of the answer myself.)<br/><br/>I feel like some recent games have definitely put "love your fellow players" in the procedures, though I'm having a hard time thinking of definite examples.

This is also why sometimes railroading feels wrong, when the GM forces feelings into the players to justify them taking actions they don't want to take. But I do think there can be procedural tools for helping get players to the point where they can manifest a certain degree of emotion, and even help the group escalate those feelings as the game goes further. Succesful story games -like Fiasco- get people there. Emotions can be akward sometimes, but as long as it makes you feel something it becames more than just a game for you, and most of the time it becames Fun.<br/><br/>For example, something I took from Fiasco and other story games: let the players feed the fiction. The more they invest in it, the more they get related to it, and even get to the point of trying to protect it. Like the paladin PC that could kill anything it finds on his way just for the XP, but will do anything to protect his mount since it's HIS mount.<br/><br/>Another procedural tool also mentioned as a cool feature in Fiasco is PC relationships. These stir emotions in players that a D&amp;D party takes whole campaigns to develope and even provokes actual roleplaying even with players not familiar with improv or acting.<br/><br/>The first time I noticed how powerful these procedural tools could be was when I incorporated Fate Aspects into a game I was GMing. I just like, throw three per player into a d20 system and suddenly all players were making other things than just saying "I roll hide and observe things from a safe distance" -Now that they were actually rewarded for getting involved into the trouble they were all like "It's not my trouble but I jump into the fight between the two armies, since i'm EXTREME! And I want my fraggin' story point for that!"<br/><br/>(and ooh, it's also so much fun to compel aspects as a GM <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>So I do think that there can be procedural tools to help players get to the sweet spot, not like an order to get there and play but like questions and mechanics that provoke the player into thinking, creating and eventually lead them to invest emotions into the fiction created by the group. And if you manage to get them into a ruleset, you could actually have the true gmless game we have been looking for all these years...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350904/#Comment_350904" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T08:30:36+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  8:30AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

You can't ask players for love, but you can ask them to listen. Of course, players could think "hey, I listen people all the time!" But if you rule, for example: "Listen only to the player on your right when you need advice for scene framing, and to the player on your left when a new scene is framed" then listening becomes more important in specific moments of the game. I do think that good players make a good game (even if the game is poor) but better games can teach people about how to be better players.<br/><br/>I'f you don't want your game to deal with emotions it's ok. Playing it's supposed to be fun, I'm not saying make a game that makes people depressed or angry. (Perhaps the word I was looking for was Feelings?, I'm sorry, english is not my native language) That's not what I have in mind when I design a game (ok, hack, I really can't call myself a game designer) But then again, when players talk about roleplaying experiences, the tales they remember the most are always the ones that got them actually feeling something. Perhaps something hilarious, epic or mysterious (the list of feelings could end there perfectly) <br/><br/>Jonathan, isn't that ruling out people? No matter the reason, iIn some places that can be dangerously seen as discrimination and it can become actual bad publicity for a game. Not that it can't be done, "I kill puppies for Satan" wasn't politically correct in all details but nonetheless it was a cool game and practically ruled out all religious intolerant people from the title.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350916/#Comment_350916" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T10:27:25+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 10:27AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>"Listen only to the player on your right when you need advice for scene framing, and to the player on your left when a new scene is framed"</blockquote>\nYeah, that's not what I'm talking about. There's a deeper skill, which is listening carefully to the people you are interacting with to make the game better. To build on their creative contributions and to know when they want or need something you should be providing. To be their fan, because they are awesome. I think in GM-centric games this is also an important skill, but the game usually doesn't break if you just listen to the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350944/#Comment_350944" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T14:54:32+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  2:54PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You see Jason, those were the words I would love to see in the very first page of every RPG, the words every sacred book should hold true, every country's book of laws should begin with, every year in school or college should begin with, every monument worldwide should show proudly.

But the separation was in our minds and the boss noticed. So he had us do a couple of group dynamics, and had us all having a good laugh over it for days. It's the kind of experience that bonds people, even if it's for the duration of the experience. So why can't games at a con be just like that?

Like, in Dogs, if you raise but don't say what you do, the game grinds to a halt. The other person can't answer without knowing what kind of fallout they're taking, and they can't know that unless you say what you do. So, "say what concrete action your character takes when you make a Raise" isn't just a good thing to do, it's required for play to continue.<br/><br/>This is why everyone forgets the harm move in AW. As written, it doesn't have teeth. However, it's <i>actually</i> the "do I take less harm?" move, and if you present it like that, people tend to remember better. Still, it needs tweaking so it's not just a recommended procedure, but a gate to pass through as you play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351257/#Comment_351257" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T11:20:40+00:00" title="December 12, 2011 11:20AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about this because of that bit in Johnstone's book Impro that says stodgy businessmen can score high on tests of creativity if they're asked to pretend they're a crazy artist first.
