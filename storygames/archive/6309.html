I had no intention of making use of them at Nerdly, save for the occasional run by clubbing. It was brought to my attention that a Build-then-Use 2 block session would be full of awesome. But, i have no experience, or desire to run the LARP part. So basically i'm looking for anyone who's interested in running a LARP, after the boffer build session.<br/>Anyone?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139768/#Comment_139768" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:18:06+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:18AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're talking about a two-block session, why even run a "LARP"?

You could use a highly stripped down version of GLASS (glasscutters.org), with only Health and a handful of combat Abilities, and bang out a few generic pre-gen characters (based on likely fighting style for weapon types) and let them go.

Unless we're talking about Tubes O' Doom (i.e. crap, basic boffers), at least a third of that time will go to boffer making; hell, I've spent upwards of four hours on a boffer, with basket guard, hilt, pommel, blade effect (i.e. not just a tube), and some decorative taping. So take two hours for boffer making (or more), a half hour or so to explain safety rules and whatever special rules are in use (see GLASS), and then what? Character creation, maybe? Another hour... or use pre-gens.<br/><br/>On the other hand, sure, OF COURSE you can run a module or line course in an hour or two, or setup some kind of pregnant situation that must end in blood ("Who shall rule, now that our chieftain is gone to the Hero's Halls?"). I was just offering Chiv an "easy out" for a situation which requires no GMing, after explaining the basics of hits, Health, and whatever Abilities one has. (I.E. Eric, there's really no need for a "judge" if the player's don't cheat--folks will fight until Unconscious--maybe 4 hits, depending on character write-ups or use of Armor/Natural Armor--and that's pretty clear-cut "win/loss" resolution, for a tourney.)<br/><br/>And on the gripping hand... ever read about or been to an actual tourney? There could be all kinds of seeds for off-field conflict sown, in a set of pre-gens with conflicting relationships or objectives. Heck, just wrangling for the opponents that one wants could be a mini-game in itself.<br/><br/>On the fourth hand, an "open melee" or fight yard format allows folks who wander up to jump right in and get some boffer action on; a character-driven LARP, with an emerging plot, creates a barrier to entry (say, for folks who want to play something else during the first half-session but want to whale on a friend or two when they're free for the second half-session).<br/><br/>Or, you know, one could always grab some wonky Knudepunkt or experimental one-off and let boffer conflict be legal for play.... Or use a DitV Town... or whatever.<br/><br/>So, no, far from insane, I am just suggesting a very scenery-light, GM-less, Exp-less, rules-light approach so that the focus of the session can be on the boffer making, not on some one-shot boffer LARP plot and management (and logistics, don't forget!). If you must have a "plot" and story, do it with a relationship map and conflicting goals and step away.<br/><br/>[BTW, Kevin: did you do that fun module as a one-shot, or was it part of a larger, regular series of LARP events? Put differently, would you say the "fun" of the module came from pre-established, ongoing relationships with other characters (and players) or purely and totally because of the module? How much of the fun came from scenery, props, costuming, makeup, and other expensive or time-consuming elements?]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140004/#Comment_140004" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T10:23:16+00:00" title="April 16, 2008 10:23AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2008 10:28AM by Remi.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin,<br/>That sounds perfect.
