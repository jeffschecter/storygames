class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                    I'm playing a G+Hangout campaign of <a href="http://gdriv.es/unplayablegames/dreamwake.html" rel="nofollow">Dreamwake</a>.<br/>The first session was a one-shot <i>Short Mission</i> (worth 3 victory points) played just by me and a friend (Dario).<br/>Then we followed it with a <i>Long Mission</i> (worth 12 victory points) with the addition, at the third session, of another player (Luca).<br/>We are now at the sixth session, and halfway through the mission (with 7vps collected).<br/>And it is going great <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The game is <b>GM-Less</b> and the setting is, let's say, <b>dinamically-generated-canon</b> (if it makes any sense).<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The story so far</span></b><br/>The characters are:<br/><b>Agamennone</b> - an Ena from the <i>Spiti tou Kenos</i> (imagine a male Bene Gesserit from Dune)<br/><b>Harlan</b> - a Svet from the <i>Sem'ya Razum</i> (imagine a male telepath from Babylon5)<br/><b>Freya</b> - an unranked SchlafLos from the <i>Haus der Spiralen</i> (imagine an insomniac girl with a "beast within" which manifests as an ice/wolf themed "thing")<br/><br/>It all started as an investigation (the one-shot) that brought down a sect of heretics creeping in our bastion (Avalon, in the Sea of Myst) ... but that also unearthed a strange and dangerous (and unknown!) substance.<br/>The new mission was then about the "extraction" of a scientist from a foreign bastion (NovaCairo, in the Sea od Dust) because supposedly he is secretly esperimenting with this substance.<br/>The first part was a weird and adventurous journey through the open seas of Deliria.<br/>Then, when we finally reached our destination, we had to start a tight played spy-game with the local Jemnost agents.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Espionage</span></b><br/>It is very cool and engaging how random details dropped thoughtlessly by the Players can turn into "clues" that, once you try to interpret them, sum up to a broad and consistent picture.<br/><br/>It might be worth mentioning that in this game no one can be a "narrator"; Players always know <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>only</b></span></i> what their Characters perceive right here, right now.<br/>This means no one can "plot" a story... but the mechanics also work in such a way that every word that falls on the table feeds ideas that, one way or the other, turn up again, reinforcing themselves.<br/><br/>So while we initially set out for a simple and straightforward extraction mission, we now find ourselves in the middle of what we fear (because <b>we don't know</b>, we only have clues and speculations) could be a much bigger and dangerous political/militar scheme.<br/>We planned for a direct ninja-style intrusion and kidnapp... and ended up trying to pull off a long-con against people as trained as us, with the same powers as us (telepathy included).<br/><br/>When, after an ambush in the open waters of the Sea of Dust, our characters played a quiet scene to regroup and properly plan their next move... it was literally mind blowing to put some pieces together and realize we were being played by a conspiracy.<br/>No Player thought about that, no one expected it, but when we reviewed the facts and layed out the pieces, the shape was unquestionably there!<br/>Which forced us to approach the mission in a totally different way, switching out breaking&amp;entering for a more cautious, subtle and complex plan.<br/>(aka: we're trying to fake the presence of an heretic cult, fake the assasination of our target, make it all fall on the imaginary heretics, while in truth the target will be apprehended by us and smuggled out of the NovaCairo bastion and back into Avalon, all without letting the local Jemnost know what we are up to ... piece of cake, right? \xe7_\xe7 )<br/><br/>Then, once inside NovaCairo, it was quite challenging (and very fun) to actually play out our scam, and to think "<i>how can we shake off our tail, assuming we have a tail on us?</i>" and to come up with clever (hopefully!) plans and ideas to do it.<br/>And when in a park our characters noticed two suspect people following them, how cool was to assume that "<i>it has been too easy, they must be decoys to help the true spy not be noticed</i>" and when it turned out to be true "<i>what if this spy was a decoy too?</i>" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>And to ponder and brainstorm about the function and limits of a certain character's telepathic abilities in order to decide if one of us could safely go talk to her alone, or Harlan's mental protection was needed.<br/><br/>And all the while, the game mechanics brought out our personal stories.<br/>Some seem to tie in with our current situation... for example Harlan loves a fellow razer (Karin) who also is his superior and ally, but that suspiciously disappeared during our journey and, when first we were departing from Avalon, obscured some info from him using her rank as leverage to end the discussion.<br/>Some look unrelated, but relevant to the personal life of the characters... for example Freya has a pretty strange and sad past of being rejected by her parents and the overall society, which now brought her to confront Agatha (another SchlafLos, an old and powerful woman here in NovaCairo, and our main "obstacle" in fooling the locals with our false story).<br/><br/>(PS: all these personal stories were actually played, they are not static background information)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt

fun" bits, the highlights were, in my opinion:<br/><br/><br/><br/>1)<br/>Harlan and Freya tried to infiltrate a local heretic cult in order to manipulate it into performing attacks and terroristic stikes to support out bullshit-story about the Alchemists being in the bastion.<br/>They didn't expected the cult (inspired and then named after the historical Anabaptist movement) to be a sort of social movement for equal rights between common citizens and Jemnost oligarchy ... which pushed some personal buttons in both Harlan's code of ethics and Freyas desire to be treated equally and not as a monster.<br/>They agreed to perform a ritual ceremony to give them a second baptism, thinking it all fake... but then we started asking each other questions about the character's true feeling and it turned out that both of them "kind of belived in the same values" ... so it became obvious that the ritual was getting to them, and they both ended up infected by Deliria's germs of thought.<br/>Harlan bought the positive perk "<i><b>Heretic</b></i>" to represent his self-aware choice ("<i>these are <b>my</b> values, if they share them maybe they are not so wrong after all?</i>".<br/>Freya took the negative perk "<i><b>Infected</b></i>" to represent an unintentional and mostly uncontrollabe infection ("<i>I don't care about this cult's weird religion, but it kind of hits me in a way I could not describe</i>")<br/><br/>It was also very cool confronting, during a moment of <b>Clarity</b>, Harlan with his behaviour, like...<br/>You share the cult's values, but you are using and betraying the cult for the sake of your personal (and totally unethical) mission, which happens to mean you are betraying you own values... what about that?<br/>And to this Dario offered a very logical and compartimentalized justification of why Harlan's actions fitted anyway within his own ethics.<br/>We all agreed it sounded like total denial... and it was awesome <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2)<br/>Harlan and Freya were partnered with a weird girl named Achmed.<br/>She acted like one of those strange people that don't seem to be fully "there" with you, and presented herself as "<i>Achmed, she who speaks the truth</i>".<br/>At some point she had to something unnatural and, after the group put the Veto on an outlandish idea of mine, Dario came up with something very cool:<br/>Harlan was pushing Achmed to reveal her true nature and identity, unnerved and frustrated by the fact he wasn't able to read her mind... harsh words almost led to harsh actions... and then the girl put an end to it by just "<i>wishpering a truth in Harlan's ear, hearing which he screamed _NO!_ and run away</i>"<br/><br/>This was cool enough, but when Framing got back to Dario he described Harlan running in a nearby backstreet to see Karin being almost killed by a group of thugs (that looked like Cenobites from the Ordo Novae Carnis).<br/>It was awesome because it made a lot of things that had been disconnected and unexplained click into place in just one stroke.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3)<br/>A similar moment happened when Agamennone was stunned and captured while trying to infiltrate Dr Sargon apartment.<br/>He awakened in a moving vehicle, tied and blinded in a classic "interrogation setup".<br/>Luca threw everyone off balance describing the interrogators as Alchemists (the heretic cult we TOLD was infiltrating NovaCairo but we KNEW was not there at all).<br/>After the initial shock a Challange started, pitting Agamennone against the chief interrogator... and in the end it turned out that:<br/>- trying to pry intel from his kidnappers, Agamennone kept up with the "hunt for Alchemists" fake-story but let slip that his team also had another, more important reason to be in NovaCairo<br/>- using the real Alchemist intel offered by Freya when they first came up with that cover story, Agamennone managed to figure out his captors were not true Alchemists<br/>- that meant that (possibly) he got captured by the local Jemnost, trying to discover if his team told the truth about their being in NovaCairo to hunt heretics<br/>- so Agamennone played the part (cementing the Alchemist cover story) and turned his slip about a second hidden goal into a further win by feeding false information to his captors ("<i>yeah, we are here for Dr Sargon, he has been corrupted by the Alchemists, he is their contact on the inside!</i>")<br/>- all while suffering a truly harsh interrogation based on waterboarding, that truly took a big toll physically and mentally (he took 1 Hurt in order to get +5 Hits and win the Challange)<br/>- then a Twist happened, just before he lost conciousness the last time; Agamennone overheard some talk that confirmed what, up to that moment, was only a speculation... there <b>was</b> a secret unofficial movement within the Ordo, and <b>they</b> had him!<br/>This was partly good, because it possibly meant that the local Jemnost may turn out to be an ally after all.<br/>But it also was dramatically bad, because Agamennone just told them "<i>Yes, we are your enemy and we're here for Sargon</i>".<br/>Shit! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div

How is a typical session handled?</blockquote>\nThe structure of the game is this:<br/>1) <b>SetUp phase</b> ... done una tantum in order to present the group with the Setting Seed (or follow the Pitch procedures) and make the characters.<br/><br/>2) <b>Intel phase</b> ... where a very specific and railroaded scene is framed, in order to determine the Mission to be tackled, and all the initial relevant info about it.<br/><br/>3) <b>Action phase</b> ... where the actual game happens.<br/><br/>4) <b>FollowUp phase</b> ... where the current story-arc is given a proper ending and the Players decide if the Mission end here (Standard Followup) or needs another story-arc to be tackled to its fullest (Continuous Followup).<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>In regards to the Action Phase, it goes like this:<br/><br/>1) the Player with the <i>Frame Card</i> frames a scene (the card summarizes the things you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> describe before the scene can actually start, like Location, Time, Cast, Extras, etc).<br/>There are some tricks right here... like, when YOU frame a scene YOUR character is always present... and you musto NOT pre-narrate anything, scene must be chronological (no flashbaks... at least, not done this way), and other stuff like that (with examples).<br/>Also, the Framing Card moves clockwise at the end of each scene... and the Start and End of each scene are very clear-cut events.<br/><br/>2) after framing, Players can contribute to a scene in various ways.<br/>Primarily by playing their own characters (describing what she does and says and thinks)... to this end a character always succeedes in what she tries to do.<br/>Players can also flesh out the scene with scenographic details and manouvering NPCs (but YOU can never make an NPC answer to YOUR character's interactions... so no talking to yourself).<br/>Players can also summon unexpected complications (by rolling 1d6 on a table, earning points).<br/>Players can ask Yes/No questions and have a 1d6 roll answer them.<br/>Players can TAG some fictional element as positive or negative by spending or earning points.<br/>Players can TAG some fictional element as an Obstacle, something you can't overcome just by saying you do... you need to roll dice (why? it's the only way to make the mission's story-arc proceed).<br/>But before all of this even comes into play, the book gives you simple but powerful tools to moderate your game-conversation, to help settle any possible Player-Player conflict with zero arguing and in a clear and equitable way.<br/><br/>The thing that does the no-GM trick here is that all Players are only ever allowed to describe something a PC is <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>perceiving</b></span></i>, right here, right now.<br/>With this, and the structured sharing of everything else, and the random generators of events/answers, no Player can know what whill happen, what is true and what is not, what is fact and what is conjecture... you only ever know what your PC knows... and some extra metagame info you get from the other PCs perspectives.<br/><br/>No one can say the man across the street is in truth a spy unless a PC somehow perceives it.<br/>No one can say what lays behind a door unless a PC somehow goes to check it out.<br/>No one can say the gun was fired by a hired hitman from the martian mob unless a PC somehow finds proof of that.<br/>And even then... it is "just" what your PC saw, heard or found... it is not out-game established "truth".<br/><br/>So in the end you basically pass the time <b>playing your character</b>, and then adding other details whenever you feel like it, or whenver the system tells you need to.<br/>You ask questions, you answer questions.<br/>The story unfolds and you get surprised by it.<br/><br/>An interesting side effect I noticed is that often Players star making plans and conjectures, talking just as if they were their characters.<br/>It's not a roleplay... they are actually talking to each other, debating whether or not to trust the Red Moon lady, or if a heist could be pulled off instead of a frontal attack... they end up truly thinkering with the clues the PCs found, trying to make sense of them.<br/>This in turn feeds everybody's immagination, influencing future developments of the story in unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>Does this answer your question?

It did. I have to thank you for writing that information-filled post but, like always, some questions were raised.<br/>\n<blockquote>1) <b>SetUp phase</b> ... done una tantum in order to present the group with the Setting Seed (or follow the Pitch procedures) and make the characters.</blockquote>\nHow is this made? Is it one person who drops the information? Is it anything in the setting seed or pitch procedures that you think stands out as typical for your game?\n<blockquote>2) <b>Intel phase</b> ... where a very specific and railroaded scene is framed, in order to determine the Mission to be tackled, and all the initial relevant info about it.</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean with railroaded? Dropping the characters in front of something in media res? Who or what is framing that scene?\n<blockquote>4) <b>FollowUp phase</b> ... where the current story-arc is given a proper ending and the Players decide if the Mission end here (Standard Followup) or needs another story-arc to be tackled to its fullest (Continuous Followup).</blockquote>\nDo you have anything else that is discussed, like how the participants think it's going, highlights of the session and what to do after the session is complete? (The last one may build a group feeling.)\n<blockquote>Also, the Framing Card moves clockwise at the end of each scene... and the Start and End of each scene are very clear-cut events.</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean with very clear-cut events? Is everything explained, or can you cut right before a resolution and leave what's going to happen unsaid? (Creating cliffhangers)\n<blockquote>Players can also flesh out the scene with scenographic details and manouvering NPCs (but YOU can never make an NPC answer to YOUR character's interactions... so no talking to yourself).<br/>/.../<br/>Players can ask Yes/No questions and have a 1d6 roll answer them.</blockquote>\nA good rule in the brackets there. Why would a player ask a yes/no question if that person can invent scenographic details and control the NPCs?\n<blockquote>An interesting side effect I noticed is that often Players star making plans and conjectures, talking just as if they were their characters.<br/>It's not a roleplay... they are actually talking to each other, debating whether or not to trust the Red Moon lady, or if a heist could be pulled off instead of a frontal attack... they end up truly thinkering with the clues the PCs found, trying to make sense of them.<br/>This in turn feeds everybody's immagination, influencing future developments of the story in unpredictable ways.</blockquote>\nThis sounds awesome. I've been on sessions when the players did this, but then it's been more about me, as a game master, using structures and nurturing the players into that behavior. I haven't really had this experience without a game master. One group was even so afraid of "play before play" that they blocked themselves into doing this. I personally like this, when meta talk could as easily be in game talk, but where it's not important what it actually is. The important thing is that everybody are involved and excited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424514/#Comment_424514" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T17:23:37+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  5:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mmm ... I'm starting to think you might be better off just reading the book (link at the start of the first post).<br/>But anyway, let's see.\n<blockquote><b>SetUp Phase</b></blockquote>\nThe standard SetUp phase assumes you are using a <i>Setting in a Box</i>.<br/>The default setting (the Dreamwake one) is presented following this very structure, and it goes like this:<br/>- there is a Setting Seed<br/>- there are some Crunchy Bits<br/>- there is a World Deck of cards<br/><br/>During SetUp you do only 2 things: you read the Seed to all participants, and then you create the PCs.<br/>(The Seed is a very brief text of less than one page, presenting the very essential core concepts of the setting, super-concentrated and focused on what players will see and do NOW in the present)<br/><br/>Crunchy Bits are bite-sized pieces of "active setting" ... they use the normal rules of the game to offer practical example of how you can use them... and at the same time convey canon information about the setting.<br/><br/>A World Deck (not yet existent for Dreamwake, but I'm working on it) is basically a deck of cards with 20 places, 20 people/organizations, 20 items, 20 threats.<br/>These elements are 100% fiction, no rules attached.<br/>They are meant both as another source of bite-sized canon setting information, and as a tool to help players come up with ideas, both offering official examples, and a way to randomly pick "a location" or maybe "a person" etc.<br/><br/>THIS is how Dreamwake conveis setting... no long explanations, no "dead" info no one will ever use in active play, no sourcebooks to be read and studied.<br/>Only 100% usable material to give the Players the correct feeling and starting point... then the rest will be explored/created in-game.<br/><br/>This is how Dreamwake handles the minutious representation of an already existing, deep, complex setting... I'm using the Setting in a Box format to "rescue" some Traditional settings I love, like Shadowrun, Dark Sun, SLA Induesties, Aeon Trinity, etc.<br/><br/>The book offers an appendix with an alternative SetUp meant to help people do simpler "color hacks".<br/>The procedure is really the same, you just do a series of brief and focussed <i>pitches</i> in place of having a Setting Seed, and then you play right away.\n<blockquote><b>Intel Phase</b></blockquote>\nIn-Fiction the PCs are getting (and accepting) a mission... this is already a Scene of the game, the very starting point, so all Communication Rules already apply.<br/>Out-Fiction the Players are answering a specific series of questions in order to establish the details of the mission.<br/>Once the table knows what the mission is about and what intel they have about it, the Intel Phase ends and the Action Phase starts.<br/>In a way, the whole phase is a big "framing" made by all the players following a scripted path.\n<blockquote>Bonding Exercises</blockquote>\nNope, the rules don't openly suggest any such activity ... most examples and explanations in the book basically boil down to "ask questions! talk to each other! ask for guidance and help and ideas! offer your own ideas!".<br/>But that's it.\n<blockquote><b>Scene Framing</b></blockquote>\nWhen you frame a scene you must follow a rigid list of elements you HAVE to describe:<br/>- Location (where is the scene happening?)<br/>- Time (when is the scene happening in relation to the previous scene?)<br/>- Cast (what PCs are present in addition to your own?)<br/>- Extras (what NPCs are present and what are they generally doing?)<br/><br/>You are FORBIDDEN from saying anything else!<br/>No pre-narration, no filler explanations, nothing... although in actual play everybody always let some extra words slip into the framing <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Also, all framing MUST be additive and chronological... no flashbacks.<br/><br/>Then, the Scene ends if the Location changes, if the Cast substantially changes, at the end of a Challenge, or when the Framing players feels like it... whatever comes first.<br/>Now the card passes clockwise, and a new Framing is done.<br/>\n<blockquote><b>Quoth the Die</b></blockquote>\nIn the mindset of only playing your PC from an actor stance (or as close as possible to it) the Yes/No rule is very handy.<br/>Because sometimes you want to feel the answer is coming from an esternal, impartial source.<br/>Because sometimes if you answer yourself, or let the other players answer, it feels like cheating.<br/>Because sometimes you just want to be surprised.<br/>Because sometimes you don't really care too much, or you don't have an opinion about something, and coming up with an answer is a pain in the ass.<br/>Because sometimes no one has an interesting idea, so you just drop a series of obvious questions and... voil\xe0... you end up with a not-obvious situation.<br/><br/>It works miracles in investigative missions, too!<br/>In my very first playtest we had to investigate a strange murder... a player asked access to the official files to see if others had already worked the case, or on similar cases.<br/>I don't remember the exact question (at the time the structure was Positive/Neutral/Negative instead of the current Yes/No) but the result was "<i>there are previous records, but you have no clearence to access them</i>".<br/>This random and largely meaningless detail unintentionally sent our whole group on a conspirational spin of paranoia and second guessing like I have rarely seen <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>\n<blockquote><b>Meta-Immersion</b></blockquote>\nI agree.<br/>And in my session I also noticed another thing that was very closely related and had the potential to be an awesome resource IF players did not misinterpret it... so much that I wrote an explanation paragraph about it right into the book:<br/><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Awkward Silence</b></span><br/>Sometimes all the Players fall silent and look at each other expectantly... but no one speaks.<br/>They don\u2019t know how to start things out or what to do next or who should say what or<br/>something along those lines.<br/>This is good.<br/>It offers an opportunity to take a good look at the current situation, regroup, and get a better<br/>focus on the game.<br/>The first thing to do is to look at your Character!<br/>Where is she now? What was she doing? What does she wants/needs to do next?<br/>If you look at your own PC and say what she does and thinks, all becomes much clearer.<br/>The second thing you should do is to frame a quiet scene where the PCs can meet and<br/>talk and actually say \u201cWhat the hell is going on? What do we do now?\u201d.<br/>This helps Players to set things straight, clarify obscure points, remember past details and<br/>put together all the pieces of the puzzle... and drops new ideas on the table!<br/>Brainstorming in this fashion is very fun and immersive because while your PC is thinking<br/>hard and brainstorming to make sense of things, you (the Player) are doing the same!<br/>Try to get the big picture... make sense of apparently random details... ask questions about<br/>nebulous events.<br/>In the end this is all pure speculations and conjectures; it will give the PCs a direction, but<br/>then again maybe their assumptions were correct, and maybe they were wrong... go do<br/>something to find out!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
