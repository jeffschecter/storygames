Especially having played a dozen traditional games over the past few months I realize that there are things that I believe players can be doing to bring more fun to the table if their goals are to tell good stories.<br/><br/>Much of this advice is old hat to most everyone here and I apologize for asking you to slog through the proverbial dead horse but your input is greatly appreciated.  I'd like to know what you think.  I'd like to know where you think I am off the mark, sound too pushy, overstate something, etc.  I'd like to know how you liked the examples.  What would have been something you added or took away?  What about length and all that.  I am trying to do this more and it's important to me in the next few months to put some of these ideas out there to those who I will be communicating some of my traditional designs to.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your valuable ideas,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145426/#Comment_145426" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T08:37:26+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  8:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.<br/><br/>I think I disagree with the premise, actually. Conflicts are important, in stories, but if you focus exclusively on them, you're telling a very particular kind of story. Stories can be about the quiet moments, too. <br/><br/>You're suggesting taking elements from indie games and incorporating them into other games. There's some sense in that, but there are caveats to add, I think.<br/><br/>Those elements were originally put in the games to support a definite style of play. You can't necessarily make another game more fun by transplanting a mechanic from an indie game. If you do, you'll change the game in a very particular way.<br/><br/>Like, for example, imagine I transplanted the Roach's Reputation mechanic into D&amp;D. It might well put more of a story into the game, but it'd have a very particular effect, too.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145434/#Comment_145434" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T09:40:17+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  9:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, about transplanting mechanics. My thought on this is that I'd like to see more people exposed to these ideas and games and starting to see how they DO transform games. Many of the games I am seeing are in desperate need of transformation. <br/><br/>Sure, I knew someone here would disagree with focusing on conflicts. Butanority of adventure gaming out there is of should be conflict oriented. Some people need to know how to walk first, to be trite. I see too many games where they want to tell these cool epic tales of sword and sorcery and they wind up shopping or looking up spells. It'd be one thing if they were like "wow, that was fun."  but they're not.  Especially speaking to a D&amp;D crowd I felt itore productive to speak to the sorts of stories they are trying to craft. <br/><br/>Thnks Graham, you always give me the best feedback!<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145435/#Comment_145435" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T09:43:15+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  9:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham could you give me an example of a story without conflict that would be fun to game?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145442/#Comment_145442" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T10:17:52+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 10:17AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Don,<br/><br/>Back in 2001 we played an eight or nine session Theatrix superheroes game. Somewhere around session four I revealed that I'd hired a private detective to try and find my partner's girlfriend, who had disappeared after he killed himself back when we were teenagers, and who I'd always had a torch for. I made the revelation of having hired the private detective by telling the GM to play my character taking a phone call. I played the private detective for the call, describing the woman he'd tracked down as nutcase, and giving rather lurid details of her in-yer-face tattoos from the photos he'd taken with a hidden camera in the showers at her gym.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how well I'd previously established my character's unresolved emotions, but assuming I had, then the scene was tense, productive of distress for my character, and compelling because of it, rather than an event of conflict resolution. What Graham is saying isn't that games can be fun without conflict, but that other stuff can be just as compelling and watchable, and when taken together, the result is more powerful than if you'd exclusively focused on stringing conflicts together.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145451/#Comment_145451" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T10:55:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 10:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Graham could you give me an example of a story without conflict that would be fun to game?</blockquote>\nWell, it's not so much about story-without-conflict, in my opinion. I'm suggesting that other things are important, in a story, apart from a conflict.<br/><br/>Like, in Casablanca, the interesting bit isn't <i>as such</i> Ilsa's conflict over whether to stay with Rick or go with Laszlo. It's the fallout after she's made the decision. If you were playing Casablanca as a game*, you wouldn't want to drive towards another conflict after she'd made that decision. You'd want to play through the fallout.<br/><br/>(I think.)<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* Which is a great idea, by the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145452/#Comment_145452" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T10:56:49+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 10:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 10:59AM by Graham.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Bollocks.

Resolving conflict is playing out an arguement, rolling dice to shoot stuff, or making a fateful decision as to whether to leave or not.  Informing conflict is working out what happens to lead up to the arguement, a characters introspection over the ethics of shooting stuff and the fallout from one's decision to leave.  <br/><br/>It was never said that we shouldn't play out that stuff.<br/><br/>What do I think games suffer from, in my experience?  Conversations that go on far too long for everyone.  Entire sessions of shopping and figuring out who carries the 10' pole.  Entire sessions of roleplaying out the planning of taking the corporate tower knowing full well it won't go as planned and if it did it would be dull as shit.<br/><br/>And I also want to point out that we probably all have had some awesome quiet moments - chats with our mothers and lovers about what's going on.  Cool debriefings and bedside to fallen comrades.  But the time devoted to those very hit-or-miss moments in games compared to the sheer weight of the hours many of us have spent listening to players bicker over setting minutea or deciding which 5' square to step in I think definately warrants "getting to the good stuff" advice.  If a group really wants to tell good stories and they are not familiar with this approach to storytelling I think even if more games "string conflicts together" they are still going to have more fun than the above examples (I don't care how much you like shopping) and eventually can start to capitalize on the quiet moments between later, no?<br/><br/>This is very valuable input guys, thanks!<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146467/#Comment_146467" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T12:23:32+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 12:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 12:23PM by eruditus.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you guys disagree with these points?
