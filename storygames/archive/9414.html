There were some cute mechanics to emphasize magic/faeriedust/etc. Specifially:<br/><br/>- Potions: their effect is on a sealed card, and you don't know what they do until you use and open them. Also, glittery powder sealed inside each potion card. (Our hosts were very tolerant.)<br/><br/>- Masks: Many people had masks, which they could put on to suddenly look like a "Noble", or "Peasant", or something else. The GMs were clear that these masks would always fool us. There were some funny moments of "oh, my Noble father is here, let me just step aside and find him" "I'm here! Where's that Peasant bastard son of mine?"<br/><br/>- Glamours: faerie magic! It takes the form of a hat with a folded affect card in the front. When someone puts a glamour on you, they place the hat and open the card for you. Result: you walk around with no idea what's on your head, and all other players start reacting to the effect. In other words, some faerie did some magic and everyone starts treating you like their ex-wife and it's KINDA WEIRD. This worked fabulously.<br/><br/>The result was emergently foolish behavior in the style of the play, which I appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208696/#Comment_208696" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T06:25:42+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  6:25AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really fun.  The combination of personal mystery and shared agreement is killer.  Did it have characters from the play or was it used as inspiration?  <br/><br/>(I always wanted to make a sueprhero team called the Rude Mechanicals.  Snug the Joiner, Francis Flute, they would be fearsome.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208718/#Comment_208718" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T10:27:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 10:27AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, awesome. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208722/#Comment_208722" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T10:32:45+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 10:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a moment of serendipity, the lady and I went to a performance of <i>Midsummer</i> on Tuesday night, and I can easily see there being tons of great inspirational material for a LARP there, or even a tabletop game, if treated right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
