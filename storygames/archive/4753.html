Hollis's mom, who was kind of a strange hippy type, had bought him a new kind of game--"Dungeons &amp; Dragons" (Mentzer, Red Box, 1983)--and he wanted us to play it with him as the "Dungeon Master."<br/>\n<br/>\nFor pretty much the next twenty years, I've been a big fan of RPG's in general, and Red Box D&amp;D; has always held a special spot in my heart.  That was our favorite game from about 1985 to 1989.  Our characters went on crazy quests, defeated Demogorgon, won strange artifacts, fought beasts from the 5th Dimension (the Dimension of Nightmares, y'know).  With the recent threads about it on various on-line fora, I dug out my old copies--and I'm <i>astonished</i> that, to the best of my knowledge, <b>we never engaged with any of the rules.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nOn that first night, I played a Cleric with 4 Charisma.  None of us knew what "Charisma" meant, but I was <i>very</i> unhappy with that low score.  Tim played a Fighter.  I don't remember anything about the dungeon, except that it involved graph paper, and all kinds of crazy monsters from the AD&amp;D; Monster Manual (which had funky pictures in it).  My Cleric died almost immediately fighting a carrion crawler; we bribed Hollis with Halloween candy to let us live.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the rest of our "campaign" over the next couple of years ended up being weird, random stuff that didn't make much sense, handled almost entirely through declaration and fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\n* We never bothered with encumbrance rules<br/>\n* We never bothered with morale<br/>\n* We never bothered with movement<br/>\n* We never bothered with spell durations &amp; AoE<br/>\n* We never bothered with spells, actually<br/>\n* We never bothered with attack rolls, damage, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically: you name the rule, we ignored it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCONTINUED BELOW                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107061/#Comment_107061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T13:48:43+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  1:48PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The process of playing Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons consisted of...<br/>\n<br/>\n* Drawing maps on graph paper.  All the time.  I was lucky because my dad was an engineer, and he had easy access to all the graph paper I would ever need.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Imagining your character's crazy adventures to yourself, and then maybe telling your friends about them.  I think my guy found the Scarf-Sword of Sinbad--it was this scarf, that was also a sword, and Sinbad used it.  I found it in this port city in the desert!  It was hard to get to!  I had to read directions on how to get there, by using my Elf-vision to read a map written in vapor upon the ocean mists.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Also: imagining making friends with strange monsters.  Like, the lion-pegasus friend, who was really smart and fierce and probably gave me advice, and looked cool even though I could not draw lions very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Along the same lines, having sex with were-tigers.  A few decades of sexual development have persuaded me that this would most likely be a bad idea.  I am sorry, all you fine were-tiger ladies out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Every once in a while, we'd get together, and imagine a new crazy adventure for a character.  Like the time I subdued this gold dragon, sold it, and made enough money to buy a warship.<br/>\n<br/>\n* At one point early on we had a party of NPC's, including Greegan from the basic set (because he was awesome) and Grax the Dwarf (who was so dumb we paid him with dirt).  We got a lot of mileage out of how dumb Grax was.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Reading and re-reading the adventure modules, wondering what it would be like to play them.  I remember <i>The Tree of Life</i> in particular, and thinking it was potentially cool but also involved a lot of stupid shit about colorful rainbows, puzzles, and trials.  More bad-ass wizards who wanted to be an Elf and had a fortress and rode around on a wyvern, please...<br/>\n<br/>\n* Buying more of the boxed sets, to think of more crazy adventures.  One of them involved advancing 20 levels by giving the DM a lot of candy at lunch time.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The one time I remember actually playing the game more or less as intended, my guy was in a dungeon, off on his own, in a room when the orcs start knocking on the door.  I decide that my character will hide under the bed!  To demonstrate, I then hid under the bed myself.  Tim and Hollis demonstrated the Orcs' reaction by jumping on the bed.  I think we never finished playing out that combat, because someone had to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I think in early middle school, Adam joined our group, and became our go-to DM.  He ran a bunch of adventures involving the Lone Wolf world.  Adam's adventures were cool because he had character-specific subplots, and occasionally we actually used the rules.  But God, being a Thief was awful.  We assumed that to backstab someone, you had to succeed at Moving Silently and Hiding - essentially, you had a 1% chance of being useful, and a 99% chance of getting stomped.  But I thought Thieves were cool anyway.  I ended up with an Intelligent Morning-Star.  Adam also used Lone-Wolf as a GMPC character, which I remember resenting, but mechanically he might have worked as a high-level Elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it really does baffle me that, for all the time we spent in an activity labelled "playing D&amp;D;", we really never <i>played the game</i>.  It was just like "ridicuous 10 year olds imagining an incoherent fantasy world."  We briefly tried it again when we were 13, but AD&amp;D; 2e came out almost immediately after I drew the campaign map, and after some heated argument ("Multi-class?  What's that?! It's the stupidest thing I ever heard!  What, you can be a Dwarf/Elf???!") we switched to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I've actually read the rules, it seems like it would be a fun, if perhaps equally incoherent, experience.  With or without the were-tigers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107064/#Comment_107064" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T14:04:45+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  2:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since that time, you have never played any other game either.

I got the idea that the dungeon gets harder as you go deeper. So I made a dungeon on one piece of graph paper. In the first room were 1-10 lemurs (common 1HD creature). In the last was Jubilex, with all the assorted jellies and molds that the rules say he should have with him, marked in the appropriate spots on the map.

I'm wondering how much of the latter was due to the former.  Reading the Red Box now, I'm like, "Um, this is a tabletop roguelike."  I can see how it would be a lot of fun with the right attitude, but what we were doing had almost nothing to do with the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, JD, I'd take exception to your comment.  It's true we weren't playing the game.  But we weren't even <i>remotely</i> playing the game.  There was this one time, when our characters were abducted by space aliens!  And they gave us superhero powers and costumes based on the four fundamental forces of the cosmos (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force) and we fought off space invaders by shooting lightning bolts that did 1000 Hit Points of damage!!!  Then we woke up in a pumpkin field for some reason.  I mean, yes: we entered a shared imagined space.  But the rules text didn't have much to do with it.  In my more recent role-playing experiences, the shared imagined space was far closer to the author's presumptive imagined space, and the rules--which we made a strong effort to follow--had non-trivial effects on the play experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether there's a "there" there or not, we were pretty far afield, and are a lot closer to the non-there now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107209/#Comment_107209" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T10:02:35+00:00" title="November  7, 2007 10:02AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a roommate a long time ago show me his boxed set.

But we* did use the core elements in a principled fashion: initiative, AC, HP, roll to hit, roll damage, spell memorization, keeping track of time, mapping, wandering monsters. Just not stuff like weapon speeds, or spell components, or the nitty-gritty of getting hirelings. The biggest violation of the spirit of the rules was that encumbrance was largely ignored along with any sense of reality: people carried all their stuff on their backs, including multiple pole weapons and thousands of coins. Not to mention we also didn't worry about light sources--either all dungeons must have had lighting, or you could effectively carry a lantern, sword, and shield <i>in combat</i> with no penalty. By the time I started getting particular about that stuff, I was also moving on to other game systems like TFT, and various D&amp;D homebrews that essentially simplified the D&amp;D action system down to the core elements of spells, combat, and percentile-based "tasks"--though adding detail in the form of hit locations, spell points, and armor absorption--and more-or-less customized and rationalized classes.<br><br>I honestly don't remember how we did experience early on. At first it was surely by the book, with illogical but commensurate treasures providing the bulk of it. Later I may have houseruled treasure out of the calculation and compensated by multiplying the award for killing stuff by a factor of 10 or somesuch. All of my later D&amp;D-based gaming was with someone else GMing, and I have no idea how they calculated awards. Hm, I think I'll ask one them.<br><br>Anyway the point is that while JDCorley is surely right in a technical sense about how I played early D&amp;D, we nevertheless played with a strong sense of where the rules had to be used and how to use them in those cases. There may have been fudging but the only obvious cases were (a) when I would declare do-overs after TPK's, and (b) when the GM in one of the homebrews compensated for the obviously D&amp;D-derived numerical patheticness of my character's thief-like skills by playing fast &amp; loose. It's possible that the "rogues' skills" table was revised later to bring it more into balance with the expected power level of the campaign. Hm. I just came across that character sheet this morning, maybe I have the percentages written down.<br><br>*Some people GMed White Box in a really silly way, e.g. a ridiculous killer 10'x10' room filled with a hundred purple worms. They were excluded from DMing pretty quickly. Also, we were probably no younger than 11, more likely 12 when we started playing White Box. I'd also had a brief exposure to the game, played by people 5 years older than me, a year or two before my peers and I started playing, and many of us were familiar with wargames, which affected our approach to rules.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107474/#Comment_107474" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T22:32:51+00:00" title="November  8, 2007 10:32PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chaldfont</cite>We held a tournament for all the PCs we had created.

I remember filling in the numbers on the dice with an included white crayon and then doing the solo adventure about umpteen times. Around the same time, my best friend was given a box of AD&amp;D books by the older kid who lived down the road from him. I don't think we really ever used the rules. We made a lot of characters, drew a lot of maps and pictures of our characters, wrote stories involving our characters...<br/><br/>Eventually we started playing freeform, diceless (or we'd choose an arbitrary target number and roll whatever die we wanted), improvisational games that in no way resembled D&amp;D. Most of our games were based during the Enlightenment in Vienna or Rome and involved political intrigue. We did tons of research on weapons and history, and kept buying various systems and supplements. We read them for inspiration. I had a box of dice I never used...and kept buying more.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the "satanic" and "taboo" aspects of D&amp;D were very attractive to the anti-social tween I was then. I learned all about Alistair Crowley, and then Blavatsky, then Gurdjieff. Later, this evolved into a facination with comparative mythology and philosophy. Hell, I even explored <i>Christianity</i>...<br/><br/>When I was 13 or so, I got really serious about playing the guitar. My friend became an amazing drummer. In fact, all my "gaming" friends ended up being musicians and we kept playing and creating together throughout highschool...only not D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I credit D&amp;D with my love of literature and history and my skill at drawing and painting.

I had asked for some electronic D&amp;D; game that was out, but my aunt bought the wrong thing. That mistake created the person I am today. The Red Box opened up a whole new world to me. From there I went on to most of the games available through Palladium (TMNT After the Bomb and Palladium fantasy more than anything). Then I played Paranoia, Marvel Super Heroes, and Warhammer (and a minimal amount of Twilight: 2000) all through high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur games of D&amp;D; were much like what others experienced: a lot of time making characters, drawing maps, and creating worlds but very little game time. Games usually consisted of myself and one or two others, mostly played while on the bus going to school. Have you ever tried to roll a d10 on a bus seat?<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, fond memories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
