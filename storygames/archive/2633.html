Kiera Knightley perhaps? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite><br/>FYI, public service announcement: PTA is available at Leisure Games for blokes and birds that would rather avoid the overseas shipping charges.</blockquote>\nThe combination of this fact + the fact that I don't own it yet, is likely to equal me owning it soon.

I had a great deal of fun there, too.  <br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that the fun was nothing to do with us organisers.  It was all down to you folks, the attendees, who came along with the intent to have a good time and with a bunch of excellent games to run.  We just provided a venue for it to happen.  I had a cracking game of Savage Worlds in the morning and fantastic game of Cold City in the evening.  (The game of Mythic Russia I ran in the afternoon seemed to go well, too.)<br/><br/>We're doing it again on 29 September: see <a href="http://wiki.mk-rpg.org.uk/index.php/ConcreteCow" rel="nofollow">the Concrete Cow wiki page</a> for more details.  Everyone welcome!  If you're planning to come along with a game to run, let me know and I'll add it to the website.  <br/><br/>And if anyone's got any suggestions for how we can make Concrete Cow 07\xc2\xbd even better than Concrete Cow 07, please let me know.<br/><br/>See you all in September, if not before.  <br/><br/>Ta,<br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morthrai" title="Morthrai"><img alt="Morthrai" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/6107/rousler32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morthrai">Morthrai</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60563/#Comment_60563" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T09:36:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  9:36AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool to know it was a good'un folks!

ConCow was a really fun event, lots of concentrated gaming goodness. And a chance to meet up with peole I see all too rarely or to meet with folks I only know from online chitchat.<br/><br/>Not sure my games were quite as good as I would have liked them to be. There was some flabby scene framing on my part and a lack on conflict and focus in some areas. In the second game especially, I feel that at least a couple of players didn't get the scene time they deserved. But, it was still a fun time, and it gave me much to reflect on for runnning games at cons.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
