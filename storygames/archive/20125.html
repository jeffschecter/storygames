However, either player can choose to risk losing something they value in exchange for a bonus in the conflict.<br/><br/>So far, so good, right? Sounds pretty familiar.<br/><br/>Now imagine you have two characters fighting over something valuable. Luke Skywalker has come to rescue R2D2 from Jabba the Hutt, and the fight begins! Jabba wants to keep R2D2, because he knows R2D2 has the plans for the Death Star<br/><br/>It would be pretty cool for either of them to be able to say, "I care about keeping R2D2 out of my opponent's hands so much, that I'm willing to risk R2D2 being destroyed in this conflict." Right?<br/><br/>Except now we have a problem: if I care more about keeping R2D2 out of Jabba's hands than I do about it surviving, I can say I risk R2D2's destruction, and get a bonus in the conflict... but if R2D2 is destroyed, then I have invalidated Jabba's goal.<br/><br/>Jabba's player would be quite correct in saying that this doesn't seem fair. For example, if the system is set up so that I lose whatever I risked when I defeated in the conflict, then Jabba has literally no chance of winning: either I win and take R2D2 away from him, or I lose and R2D2 is destroyed.<br/><br/>Is there a clever way around this? Some combination of negotiating variables or smart math to make it possible to threaten things you care about, even when your opponent cares about them too?<br/><br/>(It's tempting to just have them both say, "Hey, we care about this", and both get the bonus. Except the problem is that now R2D2's destruction is either certain or much, much more likely, depending on how your system is set up.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444533/#Comment_444533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T04:12:47+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  4:12AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2015 4:14AM by kksimons.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I see the problem with R2D2's precarious position - like you say, I would let them both get a bonus by saying they're willing to risk R2's destruction.

To me, this is intractable, and you simply need to declare which takes priority, fiction or mechanics.  <br/><br/>If we're committed to playing a game where we always have the option to risk loss for a bonus, then we manhandle the fiction into a configuration that supports that.  When you mention that you could simply blast R2 to keep him out of Jabba's hands, then we're obliged to invent a reason why that doesn't happen.  ("Blaster-dampening field!")<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we're committed primarily to seeing how established fiction leads to new fiction, then the dice outcomes are only as binding as the fiction allows, and if Jabba wins the roll, and wins R2, and my response is to shoot R2, then, well, that sucks for Jabba, but that's his loss for not taking precautions.  Now he has to decide whether to kill me in revenge.  This is a bummer if you thought the die rolls would settle the matter, but it's still interesting fiction.  If you parse the dice as simply establishing a new menu of options, then it's no problem at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444538/#Comment_444538" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T05:18:19+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  5:18AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I feel like you're missing something here. Can we not play a game where we can decide what the stakes are, dice off, and then let the victor carry away their spoils?<br/><br/>Like "Let It Ride" in BW, if you win the dice-off and one of the stakes was that you leave with R2D2, that's settled. For me to shoot him or something like that would either not be "kosher", or would be an entirely new conflict.<br/><br/>You're absolutely correct that establishing the primacy of fiction or mechanics is key to playing functionally in this game, but what does that have to do with the issue?<br/><br/>kksimons,<br/><br/>I don't disagree with you in theory, but in practice how does one design such a thing?<br/><br/>For instance, as I pointed out, imagine that the system is all-or-nothing. I can increase the stakes by saying "Hey, R2D2 could also be destroyed during our shoot-out!" Now either I roll well and I win, which means I leave with him, or I lose which means that not ONLY do I not get R2D2 but also he is destroyed.<br/><br/>This is completely non-functional from my opponent's perspective, who now has no chance of winning his goal at all.<br/><br/>Similar issues come up if we have, say, an Otherkind-style resolution, where a danger like R2D2 getting blown up is orthogonal to success or failure. I could theoretically outmaneuver my opponent by "accepting" a risk which denies them their true goal, and then allocate my dice (or whatever) so that this danger happens.<br/><br/>None of these options are terribly satisfying!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444539/#Comment_444539" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T05:38:21+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  5:38AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2015 5:47AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Can we not play a game where we can decide what the stakes are, dice off, and then let the victor carry away their spoils?</blockquote>Of course we can -- that's the first option I mentioned.  I just didn't think you'd committed to that, because this:\n<blockquote>It would be pretty cool for either of them to be able to say, "I care about keeping R2D2 out of my opponent's hands so much, that I'm willing to risk R2D2 being destroyed in this conflict." Right?</blockquote>\nonly strikes me as cool in a fictional sense.  I don't see any upside, gameplay-wise.  At least, not in the context of "risks for bonuses".<br/><br/>In my opinion, the only time when it's interesting to destroy something instead of losing it to an enemy is when that's a meaningful choice, and for it to be a meaningful choice, it has to either:<br/>1) erase some chance you still had to own or profit from the prize despite the opponent winning it, or<br/>2) cost you something valuable<br/><br/>This is a frequent occurrence in board games, where you (player 1) put down a railroad track that will (a) make you money and (b) connect places on the board, and now I (player 2) must decide whether to (c) destroy the track to eliminate your profits, or (d) leave the track in place so I can take advantage of the connected board.  By playing the railroad track, you are gambling on whether or not I have a bomb to destroy the track, and/or a track of my own to replace it with; or, in a game with public info, you are not gambling on whether I <i>can</i> do this, but whether it will be <i>worth it</i> to me to spend my turn doing that instead of building factories or something else.<br/><br/>If you were positing some scenario like <i>that</i> for destroying the prize, then I'm sure I'd have some ideas.  As is, though, with "risks for bonuses", it strikes me as an ill-fitting non-sequitur.  I thought the whole fun of "risks for bonuses" was "how much might you pay to get what you want" -- if so, then the prospect of your payments earning you nothing (not even increased odds) would defeat the premise and ruin the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444541/#Comment_444541" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T06:30:30+00:00" title="April  4, 2015  6:30AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2015 6:34AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game idea:<br/><br/><b>On your turn, you have three options:</b> Find, Claim, or Enjoy.<br/><br/><b>Winning:</b> Game ends after 10 turns.  Player who has Enjoyed the most by game's end wins.<br/><br/><b>Find:</b> gain access to a new Resource.<br/><br/><b>Claim:</b> take hold of a Resource, such that you can Enjoy it on your next turn.  You may Claim <i>only</i> (1) a Resource <i>you</i> have found, or (2) a Resource someone else has Claimed (see "When one player Claims another's Claim" below).  <br/><br/><b>Enjoy:</b> use a Resource that is currently your Claim.  You may not Enjoy the same Resource more than once per Claim.  (You <i>can</i> Enjoy it, lose it to another's Claim, re-Claim it, and Enjoy it again.)<br/><br/><b>When one player Claims another's Claim:</b> the player currently Claiming the Resource has three options: (a) hand the Resource over, (b) destroy the Resource, (c) attempt to maintain their Claim, thus triggering a Conflict.<br/><br/><b>Conflicts:</b> when you try to maintain your Claim against another's attempted Claim, bust out cards / dice / etc. and add Risks for bonuses as per Paul's design.  The challenger declares number of Risks first; the player already holding the Claim declares Risks second.  Whenever one player finishes adding Risks, the other player may then declare that they destroy the Resource.  All Risks thus far declared are still in play and must be resolved.<br/><br/>Note: this game depends on there being 3 or more players.<br/><br/>I just made this up so I don't know if it works, but the idea is that destroying a Resource is (a) bad for everyone because Finding a brand new Resource is always the slowest method of getting Resources out there, but also (b) worse for some players than others depending on whether it's already been Enjoyed.  The standard Conflict would be for a Resource that has been Claimed but not yet Enjoyed.  <br/><br/>This is the best I can do for now at synthesizing "risks for bonuses" with "destroy the prize".  I think "choose to destroy it" works better than "choose to introduce a risk that it might be destroyed by luck", but if you disagree, I suspect you can easily sub the latter in for the former.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest" title="Palimpsest"><img alt="Palimpsest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Palimpsest">Palimpsest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444546/#Comment_444546" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-04T10:57:20+00:00" title="April  4, 2015 10:57AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This strikes me as similar to the "devil's bargain" mechanic of John Harper's <i>Blades in the Dark</i>, except in your case, you don't automatically lose what you risked, you only lose it if you fail.

Is one possible takeaway that it's more interesting to decide to destroy valuables than to risk them? <br/><br/>I'm not sure why I'm being dense here, but I'm not getting what you're saying. Definitely assuming an interest in the fiction over interest in mechanical complexity, as in a typical story game with characters valuing different things - you read me correctly there. (Although I enjoy considering this from a pure competitive game design perspective, as well, and your hypothetical game sounds like fun - reminds me of my storytelling game Muse, as the design is pretty similar in some respects.)<br/><br/>Palimpsest,<br/><br/>Cool, but isn't it an odd side effect that this means I can *always* keep something out of my opponent's hands if I'm willing to see it destroyed?<br/><br/>(And, as you point out, if both players decide to risk a thing, it's automatically destroyed. That's potentially not-interesting, too.)<br/><br/>The hypothetical situation you're describing is precisely what led me to writing this post. "Ok, saying that you can risk things, and they are destroyed if you lose the conflict doesn't work in this case." (Although I can see a variation where "destroyed" becomes "lost", which means that, if your opponent wants them, he ends up with them. Otherwise, they're destroyed or damaged. Perhaps this would apply to any contested item/value? That could work...)<br/><br/>kksimons and komradebob,<br/><br/>Your solution, basically, is "don't do that", right? I respect that. In fact, it's a good solution. Renegotiate stakes until everything makes sense.<br/><br/>I don't find it terribly elegant, but if that's the best we've got, it's OK. One potential problem is that we have to look ahead and try to spot such problems, or fix them after-the-fact if we missed them. (I.e. We roll the dice and we see that R2D2 is destroyed. Jabba's player goes: "Wait a minute!" And then we do over.)<br/><br/>This isn't impossible, but does require a certain discipline, which makes the game a bit more complicated.<br/><br/>wyrmwood,<br/><br/>That's a good point. I was wondering about that myself, as well. It sounds very counterintuitive, but the effects are pretty interesting: if you get a bonus by risking a thing, it affects the odds in a fun way.<br/><br/>For instance, let's say by default I have a 50% chance of ending up with R2D2. I say I'm willing to risk R2D2's destruction, it boosts my overall chances to 70%. However, that 70% breaks down into a 40% chance that I get R2D2, and a 30% chance that he's destroyed.<br/><br/>This is pretty cool.<br/><br/>However, risking stuff happening only on a success makes failures/losses very uneventful, does it not? I can put my life on the line and be willing to lose R2D2 and my only remaining bottle of water... and if I lose, it's potentially better than winning, because, yeah, my opponent achieved their goal, but I'm still alive and R2D2 is OK and I still have my water.<br/><br/>I'll think this over, though.

I don't see how Jabba could be blindsided if he was part of the stakes negotiation. You might have to have some foresight if you want the best outcome, sure, but I don't see how it's inelegant unless you mean you'd prefer rules that didn't require communication, or that mediated it more.<br/><br/>In my mind, there are very few games I've played that don't advocate some negotiation to make sure that things are clear between players (most likely between GM and player) before rolling, whether it's a rule called out explicitly or not. I don't think you're going to find a better/more elegant/more efficient rules procedure than checking to sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to a group of people sharing an imagined space. At least, not if you want everyone to have some form of agency, and I can't see myself having a lot of fun in a game where I have none, but that could just be my preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444576/#Comment_444576" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T10:34:12+00:00" title="April  5, 2015 10:34AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2015 10:38AM by Rickard.">edited April 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem is that you're thinking from a mechanical standpoint.<br/><br/>To me, to destroy R2D2 is a fictional standpoint that gives a clear advantage: Jabba wont get the droid.

I'm just saying that it's quite conceivable that a group using this kind of system could, in a moment of carelessness, not notice the issue, and then have to "rewind".<br/><br/>It's not a huge deal to have to stop and say, "Hey, is this right?"

The problem comes in when someone else values that same thing. Can they both risk it at the same time? What if one of them desires to protect/save it? (It could be a person, too, if that helps formulate the question.)<br/><br/>Mechanically, I'm not sure where to find a good application of this sort of mechanic to that situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444589/#Comment_444589" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-05T19:55:28+00:00" title="April  5, 2015  7:55PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weird thought.  What if the stake has to be unrelated to the item in question?  This could be a horrible horrible idea, but I envision something like this:<br/>Jabba wants R2.  Luke wants R2. R2 holds sensitive info that's important to both parties. They're rolling to see who will be fastest to the draw. Luke w/ his lightsaber and Jabba with the button on the wall to drop Luke into the pit w/ the rancor. Luke says, "I care so much about recovering my friend R2 that I'm willing to tap into the darkside to make this quick draw faster."  Jabba says, "I hate skywalker so much I'm willing to shoot this blaster through my one-of-a-kind-in-the-galaxy droid and use it's head as a projectile to tag the button on the wall."<br/><br/>They both care about R2. And they both want to keep R2 out of the other's hands, but they are required to put something else up as a stake to get that extra bonus (extra die) to their roll. Basically, you are making a hard coded limit that the thing/person/place being battled over is not eligible to be put up as a stake. Trying to prevent droids from capturing Padme? Obi Wan is gonna have to put something else up for stake beyond Padme herself.  So yeah, weird, seems problematic to me.

It's not exactly what you need, because it is a system designed for one player at a time, but check this out.<br/><br/>Every conflict has at least two, sometimes more, orthogonal outcomes. For example:<br/><br/>1. Jabba gets the plans out of R2.<br/>2. Jabba gets physical possession of R2.<br/>3. R2 is destroyed.<br/><br/>They're set up so that one being true doesn't invalidate any of the others ("orthogonal"). For example, R2 could be destroyed, and Jabba could still get the plans somehow (through hackery or by yanking a memory card).<br/><br/>Then every conflict gets its own randomized outcome. Then the player fights to modify each outcome while the GM(s) fuck with the player. This makes the player figure out quickly which outcome is most important, and conflicts tend to have nasty consequences.<br/><br/>"Fights to modify each outcome" in Annalise means nudging a d6 value up or down by a point or two, or maybe picking it up and rerolling it and accepting whatever comes. That's hardly the only way to do it, obviously, but there's something powerful in "only small predictable changes, or reroll."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444606/#Comment_444606" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-06T23:00:52+00:00" title="April  6, 2015 11:00PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>I've been thinking about that, actually. It makes the process much more complex, because both players have to be involved in each "stake" (and you probably need to deal with order-of-actions and so forth), but it does solve the design issue.<br/><br/>Do you think under this model there are any other potential complications? For instance, I may be hesitant to put something really important at risk when I know that you get to screw around with the odds after-the-fact. If I know you really want me dead, then putting my life at risk in a conflict has a very different meaning than it did when you did not want me dead. Of course, that could be a feature, rather than a bug.<br/><br/>Do you know of any particularly easy/simple applications of this concept?

Look at Dogs in the Vineyard, for example. Each "raise" is an increase in stakes pushed on the other player, who must answer them by blocking or taking it.<br/><br/>All of the decent multi-stakes games I've seen have pretty complicated dice systems. Arguably, Powered-by-the-Apocalypse games have the most elegant multi-stakes systems, but it does it by pre-baking the stakes into the Moves and by having "choose from a list" results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444617/#Comment_444617" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-07T17:11:54+00:00" title="April  7, 2015  5:11PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good thought, Adam.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm pretty attached to the idea of the player putting their own stuff at risk; that's the whole premise of this little thought experiment (and potentially a half-designed game). <br/><br/>AW, like this whole concept, works well for a solo player (interacting with established fiction), but can run into trouble when it's player against player, as in this example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444618/#Comment_444618" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-07T17:15:43+00:00" title="April  7, 2015  5:15PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thought:<br/><br/>What if losing the things you put at stake was semi-random, but tended to happen more when you won a conflict?

It's generally only the GM who can bring up a risk to some existing value. Mechanizing values and risks makes the player consider this constantly, identify things he or she cares about, and then weigh how important they are compared to their goal.

And maybe the solution is to set stakes correctly and play with degrees of success.<br/><br/>Pretend you're just playing a Fate hack: if you risk R2D2 you get a +2, but then you must obtain a Success with Style (3 or more over your target) for R2D2 not to get destroyed.<br/><br/>The other player could say "I'm not risking the droid" and get no bonus, or again, put the droid at risk for the same bonus and same consequence.<br/><br/>The bonus is *not* used to save R2D2, but to try to prevail against the opponent; hence you'd take it to boost your chances but knowing you also must obtain a higher degree of success, at that point, for the "bad thing" not to happen.<br/><br/>If you get a success with style (3+ over the Target number), you get the droid and it's safe. If you get only a success, you destroy the droid, but Jabba won't have it. Same goes for Jabba; if he's the one getting a success with style, he gets the droid; if he gets only a success, then the droid is destroyed and you won't have it.<br/><br/>Note that you don't get to declare R2D2 destroyed, especially if you fail. That's an outcome of your partial success. I think the fault in your initial proposition is that the player risking R2D2 would automatically destroy it in case of failure. In case of failure with the dice (or whatever resolution), well, the player doesn't get to decide what happens - because otherwise he gets to invalidate the other player's success.<br/><br/>Now: can the two players risk *the same thing*? Probably not; it would make the first decision to risk something pointless, because the 2nd player would be able to claim the same bonus, hence balancing the stakes once again.<br/><br/>If you try to spell it out in a 'move' style: when you risk something precious for you, you gain a proportionate bonus. On a 10+ you get what you want and nothing bad happens to your precious thing; on a 7-9 you still get what you want, but lose/spoil/destroy/etc.  what you've put at risk.<br/><br/>Then of course you must define the bonuses (i.e. +0 for something easily replaceable - "I risk to loose my boots", "Ok, you take +0"; +1 for something important right now - "I risk to loose my rope and grappling hook that I need for climbing the tower and I have no time to get myself a new one", "OK, take +1"; +2 for something very important or perhaps not replaceable: "I risk the sword of my father" "Ok, take +2").

Thus, I\u2019m fine with the GM saying 'Ok, if the goblins attack the wizard the wizard dies (according to some algorithm or other)', but not with a PC saying to an opponent 'If you kill me [specified NPC] will die'. If, in your example above, the wizard dies, he is effectively part of the fabric of the scenario, whereas in the examples in the OP R2D2 is part of the resolution system, which is what I\u2019m against. <br/><br/>EDIT: I might be overthinking this a bit.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444672/#Comment_444672" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T18:32:54+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  6:32PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>IceCreamEmperor, that's not a bad thought. (And perhaps relevant to catty_big's point here.) How do you define if you have it or not?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of a situation like a big fight between a superhero and a supervillain. Things are getting grim, and the superhero says, "Screw it. I'm willing to risk all these bystanders dying, I just want to kill this villain.</blockquote>\nWell, you work it out through conversation. In the Jabba/R2D2 case it's clear that you don't have it, because the challenge itself is about having it. The key word in your new example is <i>bystanders</i> -- if they were <i>hostages</i> of the villain, then their fate should probably themselves be the stakes of a challenge. (This is another way to deal with the original example -- what you are risking is not R2D2's destruction but rather a penalty to any future conflicts involving his destruction. This would be similar to games like Sorcerer where rolling over 'bonus dice' from one conflict to the next is common.)<br/><br/>So there is a question about whether bystanders will die; maybe the genre default is that they are not in danger at all (just 'danger' of the hero-motivating kind), but if you risk their safety to gain an advantage then you guarantee a follow-up conflict where their safety is on the line. Or if that conflict was going to be necessary anyways -- like if they actually <i>are</i> hostages -- then your willingness to focus on defeating the villain puts you at an explicit disadvantage in that conflict (this would be the same as if you spent all your Hero Points on one conflict and not the other, etc.)<br/><br/>I mean, I think the real principle at work here is that games that use explicit stakes for conflict resolution have to be alert to the possibility of <i>accidentally resolving several stakes at once</i>: in the Jabba example it appears that for the players there are two things at stake: who possesses the plans <i>and</i> whether R2D2 survives. The example is problematic not just because of the win-lose/win for one side, but because there is a second thing to 'win' at all in the single conflict. If one player chooses to risk something that the other player values -- i.e. if they choose to do something that if they did it as part of free play would <i>trigger its own conflict</i> -- that's not a valid risk, and instead they should risk their agency over that thing, and their ability to win a follow-up conflict about it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444675/#Comment_444675" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T20:25:58+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  8:25PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great discussion, thanks, everyone.<br/><br/>Davide, your suggestion is the same as wyrmwood's, I believe, and I like it. The downside is that, on a failure, the loss is not as palpable (or consequential). The hypothetical system might need some additional "gears" to help us figure out which stakes are lost in the case of a failure. (And, unless we leave it up to the winner of the conflict, we run into the same problem. Still, that could be a potential solution: on a win, you lose what you risked unless you're really lucky, and a loss, it's your opponent who decides which stakes you lose.)<br/><br/>IceCreamEmperor, I like your suggestion of settling conflicts over agency rather than the stake itself. I'll think about that! <br/><br/>Although... I'm not 100% convinced it's the correct issue. In this example, you might say neither party has agency over R2 (depending on the fictional scenario: is he in Jabba's hands, or just wandering around on his own?), but we know that both parties care about his, um, contents, either way. <br/><br/>Breaking each stake into separate conflicts/contests is also interesting.<br/><br/>Whether we handle them simultaneously or one-at-a-time, from a system perspective, is just a cosmetic detail. <br/><br/>For instance, we could have a method where you roll, by default, 2d6  (as does your opponent, if there is one; otherwise there is a target number or something similar).<br/><br/>If you want to add other things to the stakes, you get 2 more dice for each. <br/><br/>Allocate as many or as few dice as you like to each stake. However, the things you're risking need to be allocated a die which rolls a 4 or higher, or they are lost.<br/><br/>If your opponent is rolling too, you can allocate some of your dice to their stakes; for each one where you beat their roll, you get decide how it turns out. Otherwise, they do.<br/><br/>However, we could just as easily establish a pool of dice or points which you can use for the whole conflict, and putting more things at risk means there will be more contests/rolls, and it's up to you what order you want to do things and where you want to allocate those points.<br/><br/>I think that, ideally, we'd have a simple "switch" where the opposition could say "I care about that, too", and have the outcome work mathematically, without giving either a huge benefit. <br/><br/>Lots to ponder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444682/#Comment_444682" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-08T21:03:29+00:00" title="April  8, 2015  9:03PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thus, I\u2019m fine with the GM saying 'Ok, if the goblins attack the wizard the wizard dies (according to some algorithm or other)', but not with a PC saying to an opponent 'If you kill me [specified NPC] will die'. </blockquote>\nYou don't get if-then stakes.

What I'm looking at is: is there a trick to make this kind of thing work?<br/><br/>Also, you may be right about the simultaneous/one-at-a-time issue, but I'm speaking strictly from a mechanical perspective when it comes to that.</blockquote>\nYou cannot have a strictly mechanical solution to something that relies on fictional positioning. (Or I mean, you can, but the result is a particular string of post-Forge designs that everyone seems to now agree were kind of terrible?) <br/><br/>Conflict resolution requires careful consideration of the fiction -- it just doesn't work without that effort. Having a conflict resolution system that lets players arbitrarily choose stakes, regardless of the fiction and regardless of possible outcomes, is not a good idea. If it even manages to be functional, it will be because the players are supplying that consideration unconsciously, and even then I suggest that it will trend strongly towards high-scope abstract stakes and every-scene-has-a-single-amorphous-conflict style resolution, neither of which are usually what a story requires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444730/#Comment_444730" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-10T04:05:15+00:00" title="April 10, 2015  4:05AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm!<br/><br/>I don't know if I agree with all that.

You get to put one thing at stake. "I put the NPC's life at stake." Does that change anything for you?</blockquote>\nPossibly, but I think I may be misunderstanding you. When you say "You don't get if/then stakes", how is "I put the NPC's life at stake" not an if/then? Surely the whole idea of having stakes is if/then?

stakes is if-then, but you had specifically said, " Ok, if the goblins attack the wizard the wizard dies." That's a lot different than saying, "I put the wizard's life at stake." It bakes in assumptions about how the stakes come to bear and starts a sort of negotiation process. A threat of sorts, even?</blockquote>\nOk, gotcha. I'll go away and rethink. In any case, it seems as though I've done my usual trick of only skim reading a thread and responding to a part of it out of context. My bad, my bad, my maximum bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20125/design-conundrum-whats-at-stake" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20125/design-conundrum-whats-at-stake" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20125/design-conundrum-whats-at-stake/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20125%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20125%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
