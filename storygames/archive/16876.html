But what about this idea?<br/><br/>Rolling the dice:<br/><br/>Whenever your character attempts to overcome an obstacle (foe or peril) and the outcome is not certain, you\u2019ll need to roll dice to see if you succeed. If you try something which is related to your <b>trade</b> you get one die [1D]. Add another die for each <b>tool</b> and <b>trademark</b> you can use. If your die pool doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s enough, you can lower your <b>threat</b> score on a one point for one die basis. Any of your companions can also use one of their tools or trademarks to give you a die of their own. Keep in mind, however, that you cannot roll more than six dice at a time. This is known as the<i> \u2018rule of six</i>\u2019. Finally, roll all the dice in your pool. Keep the highest die. If you have a pair for your highest dice, add them together. With three or more of a highest number, each die beyond the pair can be used to refresh your threat score, remove a trouble, or add a <b>triumph</b> to a successful result. If your roll is higher than the opposing score then you have succeeded. Ties will result in a success, but with consequences.<br/><br/>The resolution:<br/><br/>This is a sort of a combo between opposed roll and a TN. Haven't really thought it out all that much, but here's the jest of it. Dice mechanics work as above.<br/><br/>The # dice that you roll is the TN. So if you use just your Trade, you need to beat a 1. Trade and Tool you need to beat a 2. Trade, Tool, and a Trademark you beat a 3. Each die you add makes the TN higher, but has the potential to reward you as well. If you beat the TN with multiples rolled, these will count as extra successes. Extra successes earn you treasure points, remove troubles, restore/remove threat points and so on.<br/><br/>Example 1. A Thief wants to steal a gem from a case. He uses Trade [Thief], Tools [Lockpick], Trademarks [Steal] [Hide]. He has got 4D and he needs to beat a 4. He rolls 5,5,3,2. 5+5=10, so he is successful. The two 5's are counted as extra successes.<br/><br/>Example 2. A Thief wants to steal a gem from a case. He uses Trade [Thief] and Tools [Lockpick]. He has got 2D and he needs to beat a 2. He rolls a 4 and 1, so he is successful. But it's just an average success, no bonus since he didn't really risk anything.<br/><br/>By choosing only 2 dice, the thief isn't putting that much effort into the attempt. So while he will probably succeed, nothing special is going to come out of it. However, raising the effort increases the risk, but also offers more reward.<br/><br/>Now the GM can up the ante by adding threat.<br/><br/>Example 3. A Thief wants to steal a gem from a case. He uses Trade [Thief], Tools [Lockpick], Trademarks [Steal] [Hide]. He has got 4D and he needs to beat a 4. The GM however adds 2 Threat [silent alarm] [tricky lock]. The thief now must beat a 6.<br/><br/>Example 4. A fighter takes on a band of goblins. Fighter goes with Trade [Fighter], Tool [Sword], Trademark [Slash] for 3D. The Goblins have a Threat of 3, so the fighter will need to beat a 6 to succeed. He rolls 4,4,4. 4+4=8 so he succeeds and also earns 2 extra successes for the two 4s. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreampod" title="Dreampod"><img alt="Dreampod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreampod">Dreampod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384645/#Comment_384645" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T19:08:11+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  7:08PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I couldn't internalize the probabilities for this so I threw together a quick <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmPYZwHdLSAHdFFGMEJJQVllMGF1QmtWZnFjc0JEVnc" rel="nofollow">Spreadsheet</a> with the probabilities.  I only generated a table for up to three dice because it quickly became clear how the results were trending.  Basically the more dice you add the odds of getting precisely a 6 increase and the odds of getting something lower than a 6 diminish.  The odds of getting something higher than a 6 slightly increase but the odds of getting any particular value remains largely steady so there would be very little meaningful difference between a TN of 8 and a TN of 12 despite instinctually assuming a 12 would be more challenging to achieve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384651/#Comment_384651" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T20:21:26+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  8:21PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2012 8:21PM by vgunn.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/dreampod">@dreampod</a> here are the results: <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?635615-What-do-you-think-of-this-resolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?635615-What-do-you-think-of-this-resolution</a> post 5<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384652/#Comment_384652" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-09T21:03:56+00:00" title="July  9, 2012  9:03PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Example 1: A Thief wants to steal a gem from a case.

Yep, [Doubt] is definitely trouble!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Example 3: A Thief wants to steal a gem from a case.
