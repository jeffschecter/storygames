But the metadata is quite wrong on all of them.  Most of them don't have authors and while the titles are usually identifiable, they're not really titles.  Though both Bliss Stage Interim Stage and Mouse Guard come up as Untitled.  Anyway, more specific comments below.  Oh, and while some of them have chapters come up on "go to -&gt; chapter" none of them seem to work.<br/><br/>Works pretty well<br/>Shooting the Moon<br/>Breaking the Ice<br/>Under My Skin<br/>Labyrinth Lord - free version (though you have to switch text sizes between tables and actual text)<br/>Shock (though the sidebars got smooshed into the main text)<br/>Bliss Stage - Interim Stage (I think, haven't looked too closely at the original pdf)<br/>Time &amp; Temp<br/>My Life With Master Epimas edition - I went back to doublecheck for Paul and there was the art<br/><br/>Text is fine (I think, like I said I just paged through a bit), but the art has issues (missing or other weirdness)<br/>Annalise<br/>Apocalypse World<br/>Maid<br/>Don't Rest your Head (though the cover is hilarious)<br/>How We Came to Live Here<br/>Og<br/>Mouse Guard (this was by far the biggest/fanciest one to actually work)<br/>Wild Talents Essential Edition<br/>Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies<br/><br/>Managed to crash it<br/>Mountain Witch<br/>Burning Empires<br/>Monsters and Other Childish Things<br/><br/>The other thing people might be interested in is software I found called <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" rel="nofollow">Calibre</a> which will convert ebooks to various formats and manage your library and such.

In my understanding, this is true for other eReaders as well. While many support viewing PDFs, PDFs are not designed for the loose flow of an eReader.<br/>Calibre is an excellent program, but it's conversion from PDF to EPUB is hit or miss. That is not the fault of Calibre, per se, but rather the difficulty in automating the parsing of the PDFs.<br/><br/>Hopefully, publishers will take the time to create both formats in the future, or go back and re-release EPUBs.<br/><br/>For those of you who care to try your own hand at creating EPUBs, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321734688?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=elizabethcastro-eb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321734688" rel="nofollow">Elizabeth Castro's EPUB Straight to the Point</a>.

The problem is that PDF's don't encode design intent. That is, there is no information in a PDF that says "this paragraph is supposed to go after that paragraph" or "this section is a boxed callout that sits outside the flow of text".<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the most pathological situation, imagine that every word on a PDF page is contained in its own little (invisible) box. Now imagine that all these boxes overlap slightly. You are given a jumbled list of the locations of all these boxes and the word each on contains, but that is all. OK, now walk the list and put the words in the "correct" order. This is basically what PDF parsing is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat follows amounts to a bunch of guessing. "Well, this word is to the right of that one, so it must be the next word in the sentence." Leading to "oops, actually that word is really the first word in the second column on the page, so 'being to the right' doesn't actually tell me anything. Man, if only PDF had some notion of 'columns' or containers in it. Oh wait, it does? But, not everyone uses it? Great!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe underlying reason for all of this is that PDF is a format for illustration: position is king. Reproducing where things are on the page matters much more than relations between the things. In epub, the oppositie is true: sequence is everything and position doesn't matter at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible to encode sequence into PDFs (InDesign can do so, sort of), but very few people use this feature.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, one is a hammer and one is a saw. Use the right tool for the right job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308669/#Comment_308669" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T13:22:37+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:22PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>I wonder if there is a way to help the chapters links work through the formatting of the pdf.</blockquote> I'm willing to bet that the way that's done is by generating a TOC of links, not building it manually (as some might do, after fighting auto-TOC tools and losing).<br><br>Lester is right, though--building a PDF in a page-layout program for print output tends to track the typesetter down a path that won't work well at all for (metadata-) structured content. That's why folks with advanced technical editing skills (*ahem*) get the big bucks--they know how to maintain structure while also having a somewhat-fine control of presentation, even with multiple output paths (I've built books to one-button-send to print output for the manual, HTML Help file for the application, and web pages of the manual in slightly different contexts [lots of changing "you" to "the customer" and the like]).<br><br>Using free or open applications for desktop publishing, you will have to sacrifice some in absolute style control. (Using a page layout program is... well, it's YOUR headache, not mine.) Even powerhouses like FrameMaker and InDesign can't grant 100% control over pixel-precise output to multiple formats, unless you use multiple templates and book/master files (and variables, and possibly even style definitions). Which is what you want to do in just about ANY application, for multiple output formats (I did the one-button thing above with several FrameMaker plugins, WebWorks Professional, and ... shit, some other app setup to watch for the HTML output to make the HTML Help--ahh, right: RoboHelp).<br><br>Best bet is to start from marked-up text embeds, then build books for each output platform. if you need to change the text (a LITTLE, not so much it reflows!) then you can just tweak the text files and rebuild the books.<br><br>(I should start a blog or something....)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308673/#Comment_308673" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T13:53:04+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:53PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 2:06PM by Wordman.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, you can sort of catch a glimpse of the future here. Assuming e-readers really catch on hugely, there will be a drive from a lot of directions towards the "one source/generate many" model that David is talking about. One thing that this will likely mean is that some types of output (particularly PDF) will get a lot more generic and boring, because following the "one source/generate many" model while still making <i>some</i> types of output punchy and innovative is not easy. Certainly not as easy as just pushing a button and seeing the PDF at the other end.<br/>\n<br/>\nLayouts will tend toward the lowest common denominator of the capabilities of the various targets. As an example, my incomplete game <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://divnull.com/blog/2010/exodus/" rel="nofollow">Exodus</a> was partially an experiment in "using InDesign, how complicated can I make a PDF look without it ruining the epub version". The answer was, "not really all that complicated".<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to the point of the original post: I'd expect the Nook to be good for reading epub and bad for reading PDFs. I read both on the iPad, but use totally different software for each (iBooks for epub and GoodReader for PDF).
