Play a few sessions of one game, than change systems and continue the story with a different approach/mechanics?<br/><br/>I have an idea for a campaign using:<br/>-watch the world die - to generate an apocalypse<br/>-quiet year - to create a post apocalyptic settlement that the players will call home<br/>-and finally, something like Apocalypse World, to play out a story in the settlement after the apocalypse.<br/><br/>I see it as a way of collaborative setting creation. This way all players would know the same details about the world, which would replace reading a hefty setting tome and make the setting very personal.<br/><br/>Have any of you tried something like that? What was the outcome? <br/>What other game combos you could use in a similar manner?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433797/#Comment_433797" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T18:34:53+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  6:34PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2014 6:35PM by James_Stuart.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19296/watch-the-world-die-emergence-aw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19296/watch-the-world-die-emergence-aw</a><br/><br/>in case you hadn't already seen that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433798/#Comment_433798" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T18:35:10+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  6:35PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2014 6:36PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now I'm in a campaign called "700 Horsepower" which is run by <a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a> (Alexander Williams).  It's a hybrid mashup using <i>After the Horsemen</i> and <i>Machinas</i> for the game system(s), while the backstory and worldbuilding stuff was created collaboratively using a combination of <i>Microscope</i> and <i>Watch the World Die</i>.

I'm doing an anthology game in the style of American Horror Story, set in a fictional American city at various historical time periods. It's just reached the point where players are starting to pick up on connections between their game and previous games.  Using just the World of Darkness systems.<br/><br/>You might also check out In A Wicked Age for more anthology-style play.<br/><br/>I tend to not switch game systems but try to keep the same "story" because frankly the game system informs character decisions, the core element of story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433800/#Comment_433800" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T19:03:40+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  7:03PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have frequently used modules (or homemade games) in several different game systems, even a couple times with the exact same group of players. I'm locally famous/infamous for doing this with the TSGDQ storyline in Greyhawk AD&amp;D 1st/2nd. Ported it to 3.5 AD&amp;D, WFRP, RM, BW, Everquest, and a few others. Have thought about trying an adaptation to a non-fantasy game, but haven't had the time or inspiration yet. <br/><br/>We also did an epic campaign decades ago we called the cross-time caper. We played a single set of characters through every game system we had (all the D&amp;D settings, Boot Hill, Top Secret SI, Gamma World, etc) utilizing Spelljammer and a storyline revolving around a mad God and the keys to creation (inspired by the Thomas Covenant series). We'd port the characters as closely as possible and had at it. <br/><br/>Overall it's a lot of fun, and teaches quite a bit about the systems, players, and DMs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433806/#Comment_433806" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T21:11:56+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  9:11PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are a few threads of mine you might find interesting:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18770/harry-potter-and-the-natural-20-how-would-you-play-this" rel="nofollow">About a D&amp;D character in the Harry Potter universe.</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17956/it-all-ends-in-tears-monsterhearts-and-fiasco#Item_46" rel="nofollow">My rules hack for using a Fiasco playset to play Monsterhearts.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
