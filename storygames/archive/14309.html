I've had one exception to this; playing a strong game on friendship and multiple  deaths/burials, and having the players protest my will to discuss at once. We agreed to take the discussion on mail, and I had comments from them all in the course of the next two weeks.<br/><br/>But that was an exeption. The rule is:<br/>---&gt; I ask my test-players to write down what they feel and think about a game immediately, by the table, before we discuss it. And the forms they write on (with a mix of specific questions and open fields for comments) are mine to work with afterwards. They are asked to fill out the forms in silence, so that each of them have a chance of expressing their own view on the game.<br/><br/>When the forms are done, we discuss the game. I tend to ask some open questions in this discussion, and make formal rounds for all of them to have their say. And then I let them talk free too, discussing and commenting whatever they like, to unearth whatever I did not think of as important in my game, or what is of lesser importance than I imagined.<br/><br/>YES, the dissection of the game normally gives me much to work with. A game is seldom 100% in the first play-test, and I am often blind to some of the sides of my game; both the strong and weak sides. And it is most useful in giving directions for further design, sometimes opening whole new venues of development to the game too. <br/><br/>In some instances he discussion reveals that the game is impossible; the premise of the game is wrong, and will never work. And so the discussion has the function of stopping me from using much energy on hopeless ideas.<br/><br/>The testing, and the formal discussions, have proved very useful. I'm testing all my new games this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325043/#Comment_325043" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T01:20:07+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  1:20AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2011 4:45AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our group does this for our game sessions, just for our own benefit -- not as part of developing a game system or playtesting for someone or anything like that.  It's usually interesting and often helpful.<br/><br/>Generally what happens is, we finish the last session, and the usual post-game chatter ensues.  There's some discussion of what we just did, but it's usually too fresh for anyone to really feel like thinking about deeply; most of us seem to prefer to let it settle in our minds before jumping into any serious opinion-forming or analysis.  Whatever we talk about tends to be less focused and doesn't get a lot of traction until everyone's had a chance to really digest the game.<br/><br/>Then within a week or so, whoever ran the game sends around an e-mail thanking everyone for playing, and if they have anything they want to mention about how the game ran or particular questions they want to ask ("How did everyone feel about the way we handled conversations in this game?") they'll do it there.  Then they invite questions from anyone about what happened in the game (what happened "behind the scenes," rules questions, etc.), or comments about what was fun or not fun.  This is about as patterned as it gets for us: direct statements and questions are encouraged, and the tone is very much "Let's all see what we learned about how to do our games even better."<br/><br/>We also tend to do impromptu post-mortems on past games whenever we're just hanging out, as part of the "old gaming war stories" thing.  Again, usually interesting and often helpful, although one thing that I've noticed is that after a week, all we've got are highlights and general opinions.  It's fun to talk about and great for getting a sense of what we like about our games in general, but not so great for figuring out what we specifically did right in THAT game.  Which is fine, since that's still interesting knowledge that can be very helpful; it's just a slightly different variety of interesting and helpful than we get from our more immediate discussions.<br/><br/><br/>One thing that we also do (which I think we stole from someone here, I forget who) is to make a point of scheduling a break at some point <i>during</i> the game (the start of the third or fourth session, usually) to talk about how everyone thinks things are going and what kinds of changes we might want to see going forward <i>as players</i>.  How do people like the system, how do we like the story, are the characters interacting the way we want them to or would you be happier if people reacted to your character more like THIS instead of THAT, and so on.  And it really works!  Every time we've done it, we've either confirmed that we're all pretty happy with how things are going, or we've managed to figure out what we're doing wrong and fix it so that the remaining weeks of our game are much better.  I guess that's kind of like a game biopsy: we go in for a checkup and see if there are any malignancies we need to treat to make our game healthy again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325050/#Comment_325050" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T05:05:57+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  5:05AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been doing a lot of testing with solo games of late.
