The system basically works but I have been a little unsatisfied with the way beliefs worked in the game.<br/><br/>First a basic idea of the system. Clock starts and ticks up to 30 minutes. A character has skills, responsibilities and beliefs all ranked 5, 10 and 15. When you want to do something, you compare the relevant skill against the number of minutes passed. if greater you have passed. if less you haven't. Players and GMs can bring responsibilities and beliefs into the conflict to increase/ reduce their skill until it is sufficent to overcome the task.<br/><br/>That is pretty much it. What I had problems with was that beliefs seemed a little weak. I have been rethinking them, and what I am rejigging them as is Hope/Belief and Doubt.<br/><br/>Hopes would be fundamentally positive in nature.<br/>Doubts would be negative.<br/>Beliefs would could be either positive or negative.<br/><br/>Each character has one each of these, starting off at 5, 10 and 15. As the game progresses they fluctuate up and down, but the 30 points staying over the three. This would give a kind of psychological indicator for the player as to how their character was coping. So for instance if you had 15 in belief and 15 hope and no doubt you might be very positive and everything but that cheeriness could start to grate on the other characters.<br/><br/>What do you think guys?<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105434/#Comment_105434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T16:43:08+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  4:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2007 4:43PM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that high scores in your Belief can be irritating. That's funny. Is it used as a roleplay tool?<br/><br/>Can you give example beliefs, doubts and hopes? How do they fluctuate? What was your previous dissatisfaction with the way beliefs worked?<br/><br/>I wonder whether it might be interesting if they could take values that weren't multiples of five, but that might make calculation difficult.<br/><br/>I have a continuing worry about Stitch, which is best described by that Ron Edwards essay on The Ball. I'll try and find it on The Forge.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
