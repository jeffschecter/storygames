The more information you give someone, or anything at all actually, the more important the players will think it is. I only describe mooks as groups. As soon as you say something like "Hey, Stumpy", that mook will look more important than the others.<br/><br/>"The vampire turns slight around and looks at you, showing it's fangs in it's bloodstained mouth. She turns around fully, pointing at you while shouting "Take them!" and a horde of ghouls enters through the doors in the room."<br/><br/>Who's the boss and who are the mooks? Note however, that it's not important to do this if there are no difference in game mechanics between bosses and mooks. It's important to do this in games like <b>Feng Shui</b>, <b>D&amp;D4</b> and <b>Wushu</b>. If you still want to make them more personalized, wait until they are face-to-face to a character. In other words, give a first impression of what group of NPC they belong to, and later on describe on a more individual basis.<br/><br/>(I use the same technique to describe different rooms. A <i>short </i>and general overview and then more details when it's interacted by the characters.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415420/#Comment_415420" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T07:18:20+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  7:18AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great suggestions!

(I am reminded of this by a great custom Apocalypse World kung-fu-style move from another thread around here: "Drunken master style: When you fight under the influence, roll +Hard. 10+, you inflict harm on all enemies who are not yet named and 2 harm to those who are named...")<br/><br/>The main thing I do when I don't want to "upgrade" an NPC to being named is to give him or her one or two distinct audio/visual cues: The guy in the hat. The woman with the annoying laugh. The guy with the knife, in contrast with the guy with the bat. <br/><br/>Little cues like that are enough to differentiate them in "theater of the mind" interactions and fight scenes, so you don't need minis or props just to keep track of who's in the scene. If it's going to be a recurring character but you still want to establish that they're unimportant, I'd say don't give them real names, just nicknames (probably mostly used out-of-character). Hat guy. No-neck. The old lady. Stubbly bouncer dude. If the players actually try to find out a faceless NPC's name, they are exercising some control over the story, upgrading those characters. Why investigate a character who <i>isn't</i> important? Well, now they are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BerylliumProductions" title="BerylliumProductions"><img alt="BerylliumProductions" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BerylliumProductions">BerylliumProductions</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415430/#Comment_415430" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T09:16:38+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  9:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever we are playing a game in which there are significant amounts of Mooks, I contract the details out to the players. This is something we've trained over dozens of games, so it probably only really works for our group, but it really helps build their investment. Note: Our default game rules are Wushu oriented, so that's also a contributing factor.<br/><br/>When playing a more structured game, Mooks get personalities whenever the players mark them out. If they bluff past a particularly gullible guard, he often gets to make repeat appearances and so do his friends. If one cultist is rolling terribly, he becomes singled out. Otherwise, my tendency to develop backstory gets the better of me, and every mook just lost his job in Detroit and ended up here, and then I really don't want to kill them. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
