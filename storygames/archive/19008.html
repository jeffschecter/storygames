Sort of a "RPGNet for Indie Games", or more accurately, "A gaming-focused 'The Forge Birthday Forum' that never ended". That was... wow, almost nine years ago. I still have a vague recollection of what it felt like to start up the forum, get discussion going, share in exciting new stuff, and so on. I remember the first discussions of events that would later become "Camp Nerdly"s and "Story Games (Location) Meetup"s and game design/play groups. It's been a real ride!<br/><br/>Over the last few years, due to my focus on a very active career in computer storage/performance analysis, plus getting more involved with game translation and publishing in those few minutes per day that I wasn't doing work stuff, I've not really done what I could to grow this site beyond basic maintenance. Not that Growth Is All; More Members == More Good; More Active Discussion == ...Whatever; just that I definitely saw some opportunities to make things better in certain ways, that I had to carefully compare against the time and effort I'd have to expel to do them: And in the end, so as not to burn out, I dropped any thoughts that cut into my stress/mental reserves, or would get in the way of family or work.<br/><br/>At the same time, the seductive pull of G+ networks and their weird strata of self-gratification triggers have had me doing some of the idle, personal game discussion that 9 years I would have done here, in the privacy of my own circles of acquaintances. <br/><br/>Finally, very recently I accepted a new job: I'll be training locally for a few months, then early next year my family will be moving to Tokyo. Permanently. I'll be doing more of what I normally do, but in even a more high-touch and high-tech environment, requiring even more of me and my time/"spoons", and furthermore, almost completely in business Japanese (spoken and written). On my off time, aside from doing my hobby gaming, translating and publishing (from Japan this time!), I'm also going to be visiting a lot of Buddhist temples in Japan for some personal religious research projects I've started. It's a position that both fills me with supreme amounts of excitement, and at the same time an almost vertigo-inducing level of stress and fear. I'm slowly getting over the latter, but what it comes down to is this: What little time I have been setting aside to watch over the community is going to totally evaporate early next year. <br/><br/><b>So, to cut to the quick: I'm retiring from the ownership of Story Games! </b><br/><br/>I always wondered what trigger would cause me to step down from administrating this site, and which form it would take. I always maintained that this site was an experiment: Would I simply pull the plug, archive the data and turn off the lights? Would I get caught up in some kerfluffle that would poison me to the thought of continuing onwards? Would someone else put together an even greater social forum/grounds just as I did, based on similar principles, which would simply be too compelling to not simply go "Okay, everyone, let's just do This over There!"? And so on. In the end, it was a really killer job opportunity on literally the other side of the planet, and a healthy dose of looking into the future to see what has to give, what can take.<br/><br/>Anyway, as work pressures grew over the past two years, I kinda held a secret "bargain with myself" in my heart: If someone, anyone, of any background, approached me with enthusiasm, ingenuity, and care, and asked to help or basically run the show, that I'd absolutely turn the keys to the castle over to her or him. That happened at the last Camp Nerdly, in the form of (who would later become a moderator) <b>James Stuart from NYC</b>. James is insightful, caring, extremely intelligent; he's good with creating and maintaining communities; he's got "coding skills" which could be put to use to not only fix some broken shit around here, but could create tools to make it a better place (more on that below). All in all, James had some ideas, and "jenskot" John S demi-jokingly said "Hey you should just give him Story Games", but in my heart I knew I Already Decided To Do That.<br/><br/>So there you have it. The new community Master Administrator/Vidyaraja is James Stuart. He's been an administrator for a while now, but going forward he'll have The Keys to The Castle, and the direction of the site and community will be upon him. You can find more about James through his G+ Profile over there: <a href="https://plus.google.com/112165300112510479765/about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/112165300112510479765/about</a><br/><br/>There's one more post to go before I open it up to comments, but wanted to make the announcement.

I'll leave it to James to make such proclamations when he's ready. But first, let me bring up some frank points to put them out there.<br/><br/><b>** The Community is You</b>: It's not me and my site, it's all you guys. I created this place 9 years ago to fill a niche in my own life, to meet people and talk about my fun hobby, to bring people together and make friends, to see what people were working on and to exchange ideas about not just game design but the actual running and playing of games. Plus, I wanted an excuse to learn more about server administration and databases, which is why I did the technical stuff myself rather than renting out an existing forum space.<br/><br/>I stepped up to make that happen, because I wanted to see it done.<br/><br/>You can too!<br/><br/>If you don't like the direction the forums have been going, or have an alternative direction for a unique place or community, please by all means create one. Just like the fact that there's not just One Role-Playing Game out there to satisfy everyone, there shouldn't be One Community, either. Hell, I still go to RPGNet every few days to see what people are talking about. I follow small development or cultural discussion communities, focus groups and the like. You don't have to be Big, or even Aim Big. You just have to pour your love into it, treat people with empathy, and people will participate. <br/><br/>So as things go forward, things may change. The very future of Story Games As A Forum Site isn't a conceptual sacred cow that must not be slaughtered. So keep the above in mind: Anyone can make a community.<br/><br/><b>** The Future of Story Games As A Forum</b>: Not set in stone! Many features are being brought up behind-the-scenes in a test environment to perhaps change the very way discussions are created and handled here. Who knows what the future may bring?<br/><br/>Also, as you may have recognized, many people (including all of the moderators!) have been far more active even with general gaming discussions on Google Plus than here. There are many reasons for that, mostly the following:<br/><br/>- G+'s "+1 Feedback" feature is seductive in a very pavlovian way. I make a post, I get the plusses. Rat-Andy eat feedback cheese, very happy.<br/><br/>- More importantly, and this is something that no forum can replicate, is that it can be more of a Safe Space than this or any other place can be. Is someone being a toxic piece of shit to you or your friends? Or someone you don't know is crossing a boundary that you have, that others may not have or even recognize as a boundary? Blip, they're gone, and you never see or hear from them again. It's much harder to maintain that through "Ignore This User" buttons and the like. <br/><br/>This latter thing has become very important to people: Not to cultivate a group into an echo chamber or anything, but rather because every person has their own needs, viewpoints, and triggers. Someone over here might be breaking down something intellectually that over there might be causing suffering to some reader. Or there could be that one guy who is just "telling it to you straight", who in another light is "shitting on your fun". I have a high tolarance for some things, and low tolerance for others (ex: bullying, western cultural imperialism, racism, ignorance of multi-culturalism, lack of empathy, etc are some of my own hair-triggers). I can't expect eveyone who participates to have the same boundaries I do. And G+, as a discussion platform, has tools so that Everyone Can Moderate Their Own Posts/Threads, which is great.<br/><br/>But, on the other hand, G+ is not the end-all be-all tool for everything. A while ago I was considering it as a complete replacement tool for these forums, and stayed my hand because:<br/><br/>- It's a great communication tool, but not a good community building tool. I could write pages on it, but it's basically a great way to present yourself without really creating a space for constructive back-and-forth discussion. It's effectively Twitter but with far more letters allowed and much better feedback system.<br/><br/>- Google Communities is great for some places (I use it for all of my specific games I publish. Ex: I have a "Tenra Bansho Zero" G+ Community instead of a "Tenra Bansho Zero" web-forum or Facebook group). where low traffic is expected. For high traffic sites, or sites where you want to establish a sense of history, it's atrocious. For example, while a Community is totally "searchable" for keywords and the like, you can only see a few "threads" per page, vs a forum where you can see 50-100 easily, by title. Three clicks here lets you see 300 discussion threads; to get that on G+ you have to hold the PageDown button for several minutes.<br/><br/>- Google Communities/G+ in general is not good for real global discussion. On a forum, if someone talked about something 8 months ago that you're extremely interested in revisiting, you simply post to it and it pops up at the top of the forum again, giving it more visibility and life. On G+, in contrast, if a thread is more than two days old it's pretty much dead, forever. Posting to it only tells the people who were involved in that discussion at the time that there's a new comment, and brings no visibility/life to it. It's more of a veneer of "a news item/post for display, and the comments/feedback for that item".<br/><br/>- Finally, G+ in general is too American (see my hair-triggers, above). It is alive and vibrant from the hours of 9AM EST to 9PM PST, and then dead to the world because of that above "new comments do not rise the thread to the top of the pile" effect in Communities. It's gotten such that my friends in Asia and Europe will, if they want to actually get feedback for their ideas, post at times that are pretty unrealistic to them in order to get eyes/traffic to their thoughts. From the start, I wanted to make sure that S-G as a forum was a place where people from Italy, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Korea, Indonesia, Brazil could all post to and interact with in a kind of slow burn, "post/check once every 2-4 days" kinda of laid-back way. Unfortunately, in Internet Time, globalization doesn't work as well. Only a capital-F Forum can really provide a solution to that sort of inhuman craving of immediacy that basically excludes foreign voices.<br/><br/>So, unless G+ Communities restructures itself or creates optional modules to fix those problems, we'll probably never see a full transition off of a forum format, despite the incredible positives it brings to the table in those terms of self-moderation of threads and feedback. It'll be up to James (and you, too!) to set a vision for the future of the site, but at least I wanted to talk about what had been brought up in the past, and where we stand on it at the moment.<br/><br/><b>** To that end, we've been thinking about S-G as more of a "portal" than a "forum".</b> Sure, there are forums for now. But we want to do more to create connections for new people to meet other people around them: An area gamer finder, a way to track people to their preferred communication method (G+, for instance) so that The Next Potential Joe McDoldno who just found out about these new games, can quickly come in and meet peers with similar interests without a lot of effort or warndering. A way to bridge people together. New ways to present content (see: Story Games Weekly, our latest effort. Also, incidentally, that was James' idea as well). All that stuff we normally dismiss as social marketing bullshit, but done right, done well, done with real heart. <br/><br/><b>** If you want to help</b>, and think you have the capacity to help in some way (ideas, and the skills to make them happen), make yourselves known! Speak up to James and the others, and we'll see what we can make together!<br/><br/>Anyway, that's about that. James now has the Keys and the Deed, and I'm moving my furniture out to make way for his. He's a wonderful, caring guy, smart as hell, and I think he's the right person for the job, no matter which direction the community in general, or these forums, take.<br/><br/>You can follow my own progress in the new world over here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/106430054160848801055/posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/106430054160848801055/posts</a> , my G+ profile. When the Next Big Thing comes and replaces G+ in a few years and we all start moving to that, I'll likely be making that move, too. Just like the scrolls and texts I've been studying at temples assures me through time, the self (just like the world) is always changing, Ahimsa...<br/><br/>Thanks so much everyone, for making my tenure so wonderful, filled with learning, joy, friendship, and lively discussion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424520/#Comment_424520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T19:54:00+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  7:54PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations Andy and James!<br/><br/>I for one am glad g+ is not making this place extinct, for all those reasons and more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424523/#Comment_424523" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T20:35:02+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  8:35PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             Thanks for all your hard work Andy!

If people are interested in the topic, they can carry the discussion forward. Also, making some of your posts public- so people outside your circles can see them- is a way of expanding your circles and making new internet buddies into the bargain <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426852/#Comment_426852" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T10:40:01+00:00" title="January  8, 2014 10:40AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya DinDenver... that's a great topic for a new thread!
