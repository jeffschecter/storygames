I loved Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind... sounds like maybe it might get at similar issues...<br/><br/>I am also endlessly intrigued by design innovations, including the "inspired, no-prep" direction, so that's another big plus.  <br/><br/>There's a space between "the system tells you what happens, just relate that" and "make stuff up! push things forward! resolve things! it's all on you!" that I'm interested in navigating with "pick up and play" games.  I generally hear "freeform" and assume a game is much closer to the latter end of that spectrum, but I'd be curious to hear where 183 Days falls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450355/#Comment_450355" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T23:37:57+00:00" title="January  5, 2016 11:37PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds awesome!

The scenes are set, and the cards give some pretty clear prompts as far as when scenes begin, what happens in them, and when they end, even sometimes telling people what they're going to say. But a lot of the texture of the relationship is left to the players. Their relationships is always going to have the obvious free will vs determinism issue at the heart of it, but I think how they treat each other is always a surprising revelation to hear from players, and impacts the game even more.<br/><br/>I think maybe one of the core questions is: "If you could see the future, and change it / not change it, what would you become? How do you live with that?"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450388/#Comment_450388" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T15:29:34+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  3:29PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That said, it is very much a 1-on-1 game about love and relationships. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450419/#Comment_450419" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T19:40:05+00:00" title="January  6, 2016  7:40PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fascinating!<br/><br/>Would you say the game is better played by clever and creative experienced story gamers, or is it well-suited to non-gamers/more shy people?<br/><br/>(I recognize the designer's perpetual desire to say, "both, of course", but I'd like to get more of a sense of how creatively demanding the game is, and whether it requires really heavily invested players willing to bare their souls or can be played in a more "casual" style.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450437/#Comment_450437" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-06T23:09:29+00:00" title="January  6, 2016 11:09PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I watched some people who had never roleplayed play this, and they played in a fascinating way: they just did what the cards said and no more, and breezed through the game in 30 minutes and had a blast! The story they told made good sense too.<br/><br/>I'll split the difference: I don't think cleverness is particularly well rewarded, nor do you need to be a fount of creativity to play this game (although basic improv-y stuff is expected). But I think the game is best played by people who are willing to get a bit emotionally involved. I think new players can often be the best at that, but in a 1 on 1 game, there's no hiding from it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451371/#Comment_451371" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-16T01:43:04+00:00" title="February 16, 2016  1:43AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James when we played we hewed much closer to the "just read" formula than to a full-blown improvisational extravaganza.
