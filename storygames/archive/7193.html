If anyone has managed something like this in a game, even with no formalized system, I'd like to hear about it!<br/><br/>I love looking at sci-fi concept art, especially buildings and vehicles, and I even try to draw things like that in my sketchbook now and then. Although I'm not a gearhead, I have a mild but persistent fascination with military hardware fiction - stuff like MaschinKrieger where Hobby Japan built the models first, then built up a history around them, then more models in an unending cycle.<br/><br/>Right now I want some sort of RPG-like activity that has drawing and designing nifty original buildings and vehicles as an important, although not necessarily primary, element of the story and play.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I want a mechanical reward for, say, drawing a mecha - "Draw three missles and get a +1 to hit.". I just want a nifty byproduct of the game to be this corpus of mechs, vehicles, and buildings which all the players made, and feel very attached to.<br/><br/>It's like shared maps in games, where you have a big blank sheet of butcher paper, and you only add locations as the players go there or hear about them. Then, when you're done, you have this map that has a lot of associations in the minds of the PCs. Rather than "ho hum, here's another fantasy map with trees and buildings" it's "Right there, that's where I dueled the Prince and left him bleeding." Another example would be "Dictionary of Mu", where at the end of the campaign you can flip through the Dictionary and see all the entries in there, a real and persistent artifact of play.<br/><br/>So, I'd like to see something which as a byproduct of play, generates a folder-full of neat concept-art looking designs and a kind of oral history built up around them. When you pull out the schematic for the Leviathan 5000 people really engage with it.<br/><br/>OK, basically I just want to draw vehicles (and buildings too...what is this madness?) for some purpose other than just drawing them, and it would be fun to integrate that into games.<br/><br/>Has anyone done anything like this in their games? I'd love to hear examples if they exist, and ideas if they don't. Cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
