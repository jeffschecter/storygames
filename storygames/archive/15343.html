The down side is that I do not have much in the way of con scenarios planed and it starts on Friday. I was wondering if people could help me expand some ideas for the following, any suggestions are welcome.<br/><br/><br/>The first is a Burning Wheel micro-dungeon of the PCs have been caught by a giant and must try to escape. Aside from Odysseus not much background to work with on that. Perhaps a cultured/smart giant?<br/><br/><br/><br/>The second scenario I'm planning is The Mountain Witch with a focus on ghosts and the dead. I was thinking the Mountain Witch would be a lich like creature and his minions would be the cursed and unquiet dead.  I would prompt the players with questions like Who is some that you want/do not want dead? You see grave stone a head, whose name is on it? I'll let the players know this before hand and try to supply them with powers related to the dead to pick from.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aside from that Capes and Lady Blackbird will probably fill out my repertoire for the weekend so any random thoughts you want to hit me with there would not go far astray.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348396/#Comment_348396" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-08T20:50:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2011  8:50PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly, I just run Apocalypse World poorly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348400/#Comment_348400" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-08T21:23:28+00:00" title="November  8, 2011  9:23PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2011 9:24PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For Capes, I always run Capes Lite.

The key point to both stories is that the captors are too tough to fight directly, and must be beaten through trickery.  <br/>An interesting option would be to make the game more about not getting eaten by the giant, rather than escaping the giant.  In other words, the player characters are competing not to be the one eaten.  I win if the giant eats you!   Let the players know that in X days, reinforcements arrive that will be able to free whomever is still alive\u2014where the number of PCs is X+1 <br/>Change the situation from a giant as the antagonist to a giant spider, with the PCs starting the game either in her web or already cocooned, and the threat of becoming dinner seems much more ominous.    The adventure could start with a power test against the web to see what happens\u2014flight, fight, cooperation or everybody for themselves.  If the PCs are unable to escape the webs, the adventure becomes dialogue, perfect for multiple Duels of Wit!   <br/>Whether a giant or a spider, one important aspect will be the purpose behind the captor\u2019s need for prisoners.  It may be for food, but maybe instead for labor, or information, or in response to orders from above.  This way, when the PCs are negotiating with or otherwise trying to trick the captor, once they discover the purpose, they will have some leverage on which to base the discussion.<br/>Finally, if you are really strapped, there are the adventures and demos at the BW wiki (including my own 'Quest for the Grail'), although I do not think these have been updated for BW Gold .<br/>Mel<br/><br/><a href="http://www.burningwheel.com/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Scenarios_and_Demos" rel="nofollow">BW wiki</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348481/#Comment_348481" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-09T12:10:18+00:00" title="November  9, 2011 12:10PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff there Mel, I really like the giant spider idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348483/#Comment_348483" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-09T12:29:50+00:00" title="November  9, 2011 12:29PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a bunch of scenarios here to run that are designed for Con play: <a href="http://sdc.rpg.net.nz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sdc.rpg.net.nz/</a><br/><br/>Looking at your current list "The Silver Kiss of the Magical Twilight of the Full Moon" may be a good choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
