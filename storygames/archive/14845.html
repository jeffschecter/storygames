A friend of mine have run one-shots of Mouse Guard and Burning Wheel there and the shop owner was super interested and ordered a few Burning Wheel books and is waiting for the MG box set. <br/><br/>I would be running Lady Blackbird, but I thought it could be nice to run a indy game that could also be ordered for the store. <br/><br/>Here are some info maybe to consider:<br/>- I will play with strangers. <br/>- We will play one session by two week. <br/>- Some players will return regularly, some other not.<br/>- It would be great to be able to include new players each session if needed.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337482/#Comment_337482" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T19:59:19+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  7:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco is a great game to have on hand. Takes only 15 mins to explain and setup, 2-3 hrs tops to run, and supports 3, 4 or 5 person tables.<br/><br/>Plus there are at least 20+ free playsets out there to use. For most tables I've played with, it really sells itself as the "Coen Brothers movie game". Which the store owner will like:)<br/><br/>It's certainly not as complex as games like Burning Wheel or even Mouse Guard. But if they get a lot of new players and especially non-RPGers, it's very approachable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337483/#Comment_337483" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T20:35:18+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  8:35PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco is awesome.<br/>Dread is another excellent choice.  <br/>I haven't played Dogs In The Vineyard yet but it was a big hit at a recent house con.<br/>Zombie Cinema would work too.<br/>FATE games like Spirit of the Century are pretty easy and fun too.  <br/>Maybe some licensed based games like Smallville or Leverage would have the additional pull of recognition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337484/#Comment_337484" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T20:41:25+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  8:41PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about this issue for a con coming up soon, and definitely agree with Fiasco.<br/><br/>I personally think Dogs in the Vineyard, Poison'd and Apocalype World suit this best, but check the "adultness" of them is appropriate for the forum.

That can draw a crowd piece of cake if you know what you're doing.  Still, maybe only once a month on that one.  It has an end game you are working towards.<br/><br/>Yes to Fiasco and Zombie Cinema.  They sell easily and can demo quickly.<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow is excellent for adding and dropping characters, let alone players, each week.

Play sessions are quite short, so you can take a break and play a second Letter, or play another short game, in the same game night - a bonus in my book. And if you're flexible about how continuous continuity is, <i>Happy Birthday, Robot!</i> is an amazing game that gets people out of their shells and expressing their enthusiasm quickly.<br/><br/>I haven't played Cthulhu Dark yet, but (1) a book (<i>Stealing Cthulhu</i>), and a damn good one too, is coming soon that includes it; (2) instant system mastery, thanks to Graham's elegant design; (3) everyone loves Cthulhu, right? Character continuity is possible but hardly required.<br/><br/>Going back to your OP, Mouse Guard seems like a perfect match, but played as a loose campaign rather than a one-shot. New mission each session. If a player misses a Winter session, you can try to make that up if you think it would be fun, but otherwise, you can just be like "hey, it's Spring, and you've got a new mission, and Robert is back, and... do you want to do a quick Trait switch around your absence?" Again, cast continuity is fun but not required.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337883/#Comment_337883" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T15:10:10+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  3:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotta be Microscope. <br/><br/>It works with 3-5 players, the notecards draw the right kind of attention, there is effectively no set up, and it is easy to run without referring to the rulebook all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337889/#Comment_337889" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-09T16:05:55+00:00" title="August  9, 2011  4:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="http://harlekin-maus.com/?p=64" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://harlekin-maus.com/?p=64</a></p>\n<p>This is always what game you should run.
