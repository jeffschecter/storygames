Victory must be earned, and it's under that pressure that you get good characters. Torchbearer does an awesome job of providing constant pressure on the players, and of focusing in on the fact that characters exist to be beaten down and refined. It also rewards mastery of playing the game (as opposed to how later D&amp;D awards character creation mastery), and in that way hews a lot closer to older D&amp;D--but has a more interesting game to master.<br/><br/>Dungeon World: fun, dynamic, pulpy sword &amp; sorcery. It's all about adding to the world and getting characters into (and out of) great peril. Also, anyone can contribute in any area! Archetypes are present but not all-powerful. In addition, it's flexible--there are no subsystems for situations like combat. This also means that you can liberally mix all sorts of moves together. Combat tends to have daring actions, fighting, spellcasting, lore-spotting, alert characters keeping an eye out for trouble, and maybe even some parley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430128/#Comment_430128" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T19:27:26+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  7:27PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add that Dungeon World, at least to my eyes, has nothing to do with OSR/old-school D&amp;D whatsoever.

You know how Burning Wheel and its ilk use several subsystems together for a larger effect? Torchbearer does that, but it's ridiculously tight. You use all of the rules, and they create a design that's on par with how a Fantasy Flight game works, with lots of feedback loops and places to work the system. Then, add in the freedom that players have courtesy of it being an RPG, plus the artha/Belief system for characters. It's heavy on the resource management, but it abstracts said resource management to the point where it's not (at least for me) a slog of minutae. There's two major bits that run off of a universal "clock", a turn counter during dungeon-delving. Then there's the inventory system, which has nothing to do with weight and everything to do with space...<br/><br/>Basically? It takes everything from Mouse Guard, pulls it together more tightly, and puts all the pressure into it.<br/><br/>~~~<br/><br/>The obvious rule element that enforces this is Conditions + The Grind. If you've played Mouse Guard, you know what conditions are. Torchbearer's conditions are <i>way nastier</i>. You start with one condition checked: Fresh. It gives you a bonus, and you lose it the moment you acquire a Condition. It starts getting worse from there. <br/><br/>And how do you acquire Conditions? Two ways. The first is by failing a roll: the GM can choose to let you have what you wanted, but give you a Condition as the price. So you've spent way too much effort moving away a boulder; now you're <b>Exhausted</b>, but at least you got the boulder moved out of the way! The second way to gain Conditions is by adventuring! Every fourth test made (this isn't individual, by the way: it's <b>team</b>, although reaction tests collapse into one test--as do conflicts) inflicts a Condition on you, starting from the top. It skips down to the next blank Condition you have.<br/><br/>The last Condition on the list is "Dead". Yep. If all your other Conditions are marked off, that's the one that gets ticked when the Grind hits.<br/><br/>You can only avoid Conditions by taking breaks to camp, and by coming up with ways to circumvent obstacles that don't require you to make tests. (This usually involves being incredibly, incredibly clever--and doesn't happen often.)<br/><br/>On top of that, the reason those Conditions are so punishing is that you don't have a lot of resources to begin with. If you've played Mouse Guard? You'll maybe have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span> skill rated at 4 dice. The rest are at 2 or 3 dice. Later Conditions subtract a die from almost everything you roll (there's two of them, and they stack!), and one Condition requires you to roll an extra success. So, um, yeah. The dungeon turns into "let's use our traits and bullrush through so that we can get loot and get out before the Condition death spiral hits".<br/><br/>...and then there's the problem of <i>loot</i>. And of equipment.<br/><br/>You start broke. You need to sell loot to develop a working Resources stat, so that you can afford to stay in town and recover from Conditions. Loot takes up slots in your inventory. (You can gain more slots by packing a loot sack, but hey! You need to carry that loot sack with your hands! What was that about needing a free hand to hold your torch?) Suddenly, packing loot becomes a question of opportunity cost.<br/><br/>Because having Resources is valuable. It lets you recover from conditions, get new gear, do research on ruins (to be prepared for their traps and secrets), and conduct other business in a Town nearby the dungeon. As you start advancing Resources, you become more stable in your life. But you have to get bigger and better loot to keep advancing those Resources...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430170/#Comment_430170" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-28T10:38:15+00:00" title="March 28, 2014 10:38AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chalk vs Cheese.<br/><br/>Both games are Old School in different ways.

Both do what they do pretty well (a lot better than D&amp;D) and both do the other game worse than D&amp;D - because you don't generally want both in the same game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430217/#Comment_430217" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T08:26:14+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  8:26AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D's a real good game in all editions (in different ways).

One of my biggest issues in OD&amp;D is figuring out the turn length - how long it takes to search a particular room, what's going on with the thief that's a hallway ahead dealing with some mechanism, etc.<br/><br/>Torchbearer handles turns based on rolls. So even if the party splits up, every roll counts toward the clock on resource usage, the progression down the condition track, and potential wandering monsters. Sure it may not be the most "realistic", but this simple rule really keeps the clock ticking, instead of getting frustrated trying to figure out all the various party members' differnet actions time length and how I should handle time, which happens to me in OD&amp;D all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430249/#Comment_430249" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T19:40:22+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  7:40PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, it rewards players who find ways to circumvent obstacles without making tests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430254/#Comment_430254" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-29T20:56:21+00:00" title="March 29, 2014  8:56PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to add that Torchbearer is ALL about fictional positioning.

A mountain lion pounces on you from the boughs of the oak tree. Roll surprise... okay you're surprised... It swipes at you with its claws, and its jaws bear down on you...it hits... you take 12 points of damage.<br/>Player: I'm dead.<br/><br/>GM (Dungeon World): You hear a deafening roar from above. You look up just in time to see a mountain lion pouncing at you from the boughs of the oak tree. What do you do?<br/>Player: I quickly raise my shield over my head!<br/>GM: Okay, you're Defying Danger. Roll + dex...<br/><br/>In my mind, the difference lies mostly in the soft moves. I'm not saying one is better or worse, either. They're different games for different kinds of fun.

Obviously the milieu changes everything ontological about the world, and suggests a largely different set of story types.  That and the specific character classes make the two games very different, on an objective level.  But subjectively... well... they're not entirely similar, but I think it's true that if AW didn't exist, my group's DW games would probably be different.  We've become accustomed to a certain sort of inter-relation between PCs, and between PCs and the MC, due to our experiences with AW.<br/><br/>Ok here's another one.  For me, one difference in practice as an MC is the way the two games use Fronts.  In AW the fronts are rather loosely played, they can be pretty abstract and you'll still be fine.  In DW those are like "Campaign Fronts" but you also have "Adventure Fronts".  The latter are played in a more direct way, like tight little self-contained episodes rather than big co-simultaneous plots, and a lot more attention is paid to custom moves made by the dungeon/terrain itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430276/#Comment_430276" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-30T09:51:30+00:00" title="March 30, 2014  9:51AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not an easy question to answer!

All three games level up characters and all three approach this in various ways. The resultant play can be largely effected by how players perceive they get 'more powerful'.  In TB your skills advance independent of level, whereas in DW your moves are made of leveling up, and your XP is garnered (like in TB) from story based cues, moves and traits. D&amp;D on the other had focuses on mad lootz (and the odd murder) to generate XP, my favourite iteration being <i><b>spent</b></i> loot.
