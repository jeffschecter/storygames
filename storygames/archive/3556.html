It is awesome in its combustible hippieness, and I really, really like the thought behind a lot of the rules. Like, frex, it's easier to win conflicts if you do Evil Things (which reinforces the good-vs-evil struggle the author stands behind).<br/><br/>But I need help. Clock Hour Names are not doing it for me, and I need to make an adjustment so that I can run it/play without going nuts.  I've read the book twice but can not remember what Terce, Lauds, and Matins are, which is higher, etc.<br/><br/>I started thinking of a Dark Sun conversion briefly (more on that in a sec) and came to a conclusion that will work for the game and keep its sensibilities, but I need a little help from someone who's played the game.<br/><br/>Here's the scale, from highest to lowest, and the die roll on a 1d10 it corresponds to:<br/>Sext 10<br/>Terce/None 8-9<br/>Prime/Vespers 5-7<br/>Lauds/Compline 3-4<br/>Matins 2<br/>Devils Hour 1<br/>Note that the abilities and virtue go only from Sext to Matins, Sext being the closest to "Good", and Matins being the closest to "Evil", Prime/Vespers being "Neutral", with Devil's Hour being outside that scale as a Big Bad Failure.<br/><br/>I'm good with pictures and ideas, so I was thinking of the following scale instead of the one that's confusing the hell out of me:<br/>UNICORN<br/>something goodish<br/>THE CITADEL (or the SEA OF MIST)<br/>something badish<br/>DRAGON<br/>DEVIL'S HOUR<br/><br/>So what can I use to fill in the blanks? And is there something better for "Neutral"? Some that I was thinking of using:<br/>The Keepers (for goodish)<br/>Blessed (for goodish)<br/>The Misbegotten (for baddish)<br/>Outsiders (for baddish)<br/><br/>Any thoughts?<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The second part of this post is for a Dark Sun conversion I've been thinking about running at some point after I run the default setting once or twice, and for this all I need is someone familiar with Dark Sun (not necessarily LoA):<br/><br/>Same scale as above.  Here's what I'm thinking:<br/>AVIGNON<br/>something goodish<br/>ELEMENTAL<br/>something baddish<br/>something totally evil<br/>Something that indicates total failure when rolling dice, and a sacred/curious element of the world. A replacement for Devil's Hour.<br/><br/>Here's one scale I considered:<br/>AVIGNON<br/>something goodish<br/>ELEMENTAL<br/>something baddish<br/>THE DRAGON<br/>The Dark Sun<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>AVIGNON<br/>something goodish<br/>ELEMENTAL<br/>something baddish<br/>SORCERER KING (or a specific one: Like "Nibenay" or "Kalak")<br/>THE DRAGON<br/><br/>For something goodish, I was thinking Preserver, or some goodish creature or organization or person of the background setting.<br/>For something baddish, I was thinking Defiler, or some baddish creature like githyanki, or half-giant, or the Sea of Silt<br/>Also, as a replacement for Devil's Hour I was also thinking of the Sea of Silt, or Ral (the larger moon of the planet), or Athas (the world's name)<br/><br/>If I was going for an eco-minded game of DS, then I'd totally use Preserver and Defiler. But I was looking for other options too.<br/><br/>Thoughts on the Legends of Alyria step conversion, and the Dark Sun conversion?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80112/#Comment_80112" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-08T15:30:22+00:00" title="July  8, 2007  3:30PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once upon a time, Alyria used moon faces instead of Clocks.

Treat each pairing as a separate conflict, but narrate each exchange together.<br/><br/>Example:  the classic combat example, right?  Let's see.  Have to have a good Alyria vibe for this....  I know!  A battle on a catwalk in the Web in the middle of a lightning storm!  Yeah, that's the ticket.  A Digger Paladin and a warrior of the Noble Houses are facing off against a dragon cultist.  For simplicity, they're all using Force.<br/><br/>You would define the Digger Paladin vs. dragon cultist as one conflict and the Noble warrior vs. dragon cultist as another conflict.  Then roll the first exchange in each conflict.  Figure out your winner and loser in each exchange, then narrate the whole thing together.<br/><br/>I don't think that I discuss this in the book.  I'll cop to that being an error on my part.<br/><br/>Also, while you're here, do note that a character doesn't have to be present to be in conflict.  Minions, weapons, and the like are all treated as extensions of the character.  So, if teh Evil D00d sent his henchmen to look for Our Hero, you should still use the Evil D00d's Attributes and Traits, because it's really a conflict between Our Hero and the Evil D00d.  The henchmen are irrelevant.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80214/#Comment_80214" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T09:15:38+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  9:15AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, by the way, I'm over here listening to a podcast about PTA, which reminds me of an important point.

I was thinking about it more from the angle that psionics is the only power that doesn't "care" in Dark Sun. Anyone can use it, and it works the same. Whereas the druids powers came with stipulations. Anyway, it's not really material.
