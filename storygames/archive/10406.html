Here are the quotations:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite><br/>Also, I veto any use of the phrase "it's like<i>cops and robbers</i>" or a permutation thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sebastian Hickey</cite>[...] No more Cops and Robbers, Let's Pretend or Cowboys &amp; ****ing Indians.<br/></blockquote>\nWhat's wrong with pretending? Why do you dislike Cops and Robbbers?<br/><br/>I'm interested in an explanation, why you think that mentioning pretending (or children games of pretending) is something bad in order to explain roleplaying games. Is there a pragmatic reason against this (nobody will be excited by games of pretending)? Or do you think it's just plain false to think of roleplaying games (or maybe more specific: of story games?) as games where pretending is an essential aspect of what you're doing (after all one might focus on the idea that you engage in mutual storytelling and not in pretending)?<br/><br/>I'm really curios about the reasons for this aversion because I think that pretending often is part of the game. In fact, I think I have explained roleplaying games as (among other things) an activity where you sometimes playfully pretend to be someone else. Why would you not mention it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231490/#Comment_231490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T00:05:31+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:05AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only speak for myself.<br/><br/>Explaining what happens at the gaming table is not that hard.

Personally, I don't see a negative connotation, but I understand not wanting to associate the activity with child's play. (For example, I get frustrated that the bicycle is still often viewed as a child's toy, or at least as some sort of play thing, rather than as a legitimate &amp; utilitarian form of transportation.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>Why say "It's like X", when you can just tell people what it <b>is</b>?</blockquote>\nThe reason---in the abstract, at least---is that using an analogy should make it easier to explain, as you can assume a certain amount of prior knowledge. The analogy might also engender nostalgia or interest in some people, though there's the trade-off that it might turn other people off.<br/><br/>Another thing is that you want to explain why the activity is fun, or why someone would want to engage in it. If you just give a procedural explanation of play, people may not get it. Honestly, I'm not sure if saying "you get to make up stories with friends" would even do it, as I think that's still a relatively foreign idea to most people. (Personally, I haven't gotten great results when I've tried to explain role-playing as a form of storytelling.) Saying it's like <i>Cops &amp; Robber</i> or playing <i>House</i> communicates that it's some sort of imaginative play activity, at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231558/#Comment_231558" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T06:31:58+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  6:31AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jan</cite>Ok, that makes it clearer.

I listen out all the time to silly, fantasy arguments and discussions, from all walks of life, from kick boxers, to lawyers, to doctors and grandparents.  But sometimes, even though people love to be free and silly, they don't know they want it.  If you've ever convinced the uncle to have a go on the Wii, or finally persuaded the grumpy teen to have a go at Frisbee, you'll know that sometimes people get carried away with things they never thought they'd like.  So, if YOU know that someone would like Story Gaming, but THEY don't, your job is to be sneaky.

Normals <i>play </i>tennis, golf, video games, chess, backgammon, cards, dice, draughts, etc.<br/><br/>Just like everyone else, I've only got one perspective, and mine tells me that people make unfair judgements about gaming unless they're given a new incentive to explore an old idea.  Sometimes people absorb young prejudice in their formative (high school) years, and it never gets a chance to digest.  Anxieties manifest.  If I don't want to dredge up school-yard stigma, I don't enthuse about pretending and children's games.<br/><br/>It's sort of like trying to convince someone that they <i>do </i>like broccoli.  I used to live with a guy who refused to eat his greens.  It was astonishing.  Over time, I started to figure it out.  He'd been subjected to overcooked vegetables through his childhood.  Slowly I introduced him to pan roast roots, from parnsips tossed in rosemary oil, to browned kumara, to charbroiled broccoli with anchovies and lemon juice.  Eventually he folded, enjoyed it, and the damn was burst.  All of the food inhibitions became curiosities.  'Maybe I <i>do </i>like monkfish,' etc.  I think the same can be applied to games, and since it causes no harm to be careful, it's my strategy with newbies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232150/#Comment_232150" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-13T21:38:20+00:00" title="September 13, 2009  9:38PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I guess my use of the word "play" was misleading.

If you took on the role of a doctor, people would expect you to heal their illnesses; if you took on the role of a mother, people would expect you to breastfeed them. Why the squeamishness? Do even _fans_ of these sorts of games think there's something sinister or irresponsible about playing "let's pretend?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, many, many people do regard acting as childish, or if not that, then certainly as something that's deeply frivolous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
