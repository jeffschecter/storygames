Basically I want to take the FFVIII plot (a soldier's guild must take down a witch that has seized government on a neighbour country) and re-work it on a slightly less advanced world (approximately XIX century techology instead of modern/futuristic)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450344/#Comment_450344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T18:57:03+00:00" title="January  5, 2016  6:57PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this a lot! Love the randomness of level-ups and HP rolls. Love the character fragility. Love the lists, options seems well-balanced against each other. The "spells" are all fun.<br/><br/>With "Call," it seems like you could demand some further explication from the player, as an opportunity to introduce some cosmology and narrow the scope a little bit. Like, "You know old rituals to summon spirits (of nature, of the dead, from the weird beyond, from the seven hells, that dwell within objects.)"<br/><br/>Did you write this with Final Fantasy in mind? It doesn't particularly suggest that style of play to me, I'm curious what elements of FF you're trying to capture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450350/#Comment_450350" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-05T20:51:33+00:00" title="January  5, 2016  8:51PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for your kind comment!<br/><br/>Well, on the <b>call</b> subject, I wanted to do a table for "background flavor" which included the exact ones that you're talking about: Wilderness, the dead, eldritch horrors... and then I couldn't think on anything else. So I left it blank and let the players choose whatever they liked. I guess that depending on which effects they want to achieve, they'll have to pick a different entity, but also it will carry a specific kind of drawbacks (In short, I think it will be easier to deal with that in-game than on the rulebook)<br/><br/>On the second question, I wanted it to fit my specific campaign, but I didn't wanted to implement Final Fantasy quirks on the rules. I made something more general for a fantasy world where everyone can learn some magic; but much grittier than a videogame (no phoenix downs or massive-damaging summons; in my campaign I want to enforce the "cold war" aspect of infiltrating into the enemy lines and plotting the assasination of a supernatural entity). <br/><br/>But I have this Final Fantasy-related idea that I might implement: every character that is wielding their favored weapon can decide during combat to land a LIMIT BREAK: you sacrifice 1d6 HP to add a third d6 to your attack roll; then you choose the higher two results. The player describes which kind of technique does this involve in-game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
