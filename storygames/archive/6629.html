This quiz, however, has a solid mix of all sorts of questions of the games of old, including SF, fantasy, supers... and a mix of companies as well (not, like, "All TSR" or whatever).<br/>(EDIT: Oops, maybe spoke too soon: The later ones in the last half of the quiz start to get pretty far detailed, perhaps too much so: I couldn't answer CoC questions, frex, even though I played it nonstop for almost a year. There's also perhaps a few too many "which company?" questions, rather than game questions)<br/><br/>How did you do?  For me, I don't have any experience with Traveller or Rolemaster or the original Marvel, so I flailed on a bunch. But here's the questions I was able to answer:<br/><br/>Undoubtedly correct. Probably:<br/><br/>3) Which of the following was NOT a commercially released roleplaying game?<br/>4) In which of the following gaming worlds are you most likely to see a character take 10,000 points of damage from a relatively normal attack?<br/>6) Which of the following listed terms would be the more powerful rank in TSR's Marvel Super Heroes game? <b>(I only got this because I knew the "F......" acronym, I actually never played it)</b><br/>8) Which of the following RPG names is not nor has ever been an abbreviation?<br/>9) Who created the Forgotten Realms campaign setting?<br/>10) What was the name of the dungeon featured in module B1 In Search of the Unknown?<br/>13) What was the first roleplaying game written by Steve Jackson? <b>(I only got this because Mike Holmes ran it for us last year in the Games On Demand/Forge Throwdown area at GenCon)</b><br/>14) What company once held the licenses to produce both Star Trek and Dr. Who roleplaying games?<br/>17) Which of the following monsters does NOT appear on the cover art of the original Monster Manual?<br/>18) Which of the following is not a Chaosium RPG?<br/>19) In Pacesetter's Chill RPG, what was the name of the organization the PCs all worked for? <b>(totally know this only by accident)</b><br/>22) What roleplaying game started as a Metamorphisis Alpha campaign? <b>(by process of elimination, I knew the other's weren't)</b><br/>28) Complete the following game title: Mercenaries, Spies &amp; _______.<br/>29) What do Castle Falkenstein players use instead of standard dice?<br/>33) What was the name of Aaron Allston's tour-de-force Champions supplement detailing his personal house rules and campaign setting?<br/>35) What are cannon-fodder level warriors called in Ars Magica?<br/>36) What game resolves most actions by rolling d10 and multiplying it by another d10 roll?<br/>37) What island is the setting for Over The Edge?<br/>40) What is the name of the rules system designed to be compatible with both Champions and R. Talsorian games? <b>(this was almost a trick question, but I knew it because it was one of the first efforts to be done almost all on the web back in the mid-90s)</b><br/>44) Mayfair released which of the following RPGs?<br/>45) What game are you most likely to encounter a foe carrying a Panther Assault Cannon?<br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>15) Who singlehandedly wrecked havoc in the Temple of Elemental Evil?<br/>I didn't get this one, but it was because the correct answer, "Gary Gygax", wasn't an option. Fucking moathouse, I got killed three times there.<br/><br/>So for me: About 21 of 50.<br/><br/>I would have loved to see more on CoC, Shadowrun, Cyberpunk, Stombringer, Prince Valiant, Star Frontiers and maybe some alternate D&amp;D game world stuff (Krynn, etc). But hey, I can always make up my own quiz later!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147158/#Comment_147158" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T17:26:53+00:00" title="June  1, 2008  5:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2008 5:30PM by edheil.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The ones I'm sure I got right were:</p>\n<p>1) A character would most likely visit the Spinward Marches in what sci-fi game?</p>\n<p>3) Which of the following was NOT a commercially released roleplaying game?</p>\n<p>4) In which of the following gaming worlds are you most likely to see a character take 10,000 points of damage from a relatively normal attack?</p>\n<p>5) Which game's earliest edition discussed the possibility of playing a young balrog as a PC?
