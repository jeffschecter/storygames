<p>This is a separate thread to call attention to my last AP thread, by the request of Clinton and Andy, because the post was really long, but had an end worth rubber-necking over. If you want to see the full train wreck, just go <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=120&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" title="Train wreck!">here</a>. It has been described by Andy as "like watching the Challenger explosion. In slow motion. While masturbating." and if that endorsement doesn't get you interested, you're a very sensible person.</p>
<p>If you're the type of person that likes to skip to the end of a book to see who dies, however, just read on. For brief reference, this describes the very climax of an otherwise awesome <em>Shadow of Yesterday</em> game I was recently a part of:</p>
<p>====================</p>
<p>Then the badness begins. Gah. It's a full week later and it's still really frustrating just to write about it.</p>
<p>Lord Dvorak also participated in the final fight, but was taken out pretty early on. He had a magic hour-glass, which had been introduced before the siege as a sort of last resort item, that could "Give us a second chance if all is lost". Now, for the PCs, rather little was lost, but he lay there dying after the fight, so he activated it. The players didn't want it and tried to conflict it, but Jeff basically GM-forced it into happening.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes of Bizarre short-term-time-travel-gone-wrong narration ensued. Then it got weirder, until each of the PCs woke up in strange chairs with wires plugged into them. Jeff changed the background music from Warcraft II to some sort of electronica, handed out Shadowrun character sheets with the closest approximation of our previous characters on them, and hauled out the <em>Brainscan</em> and <em>Renraku Arcology: Shutdown</em> books out of his bag.</p>
<p><em>Shadowrun!</em></p>
<p>Apparently the entire game had been a VR simulation, and whoever coded that hour-glass hadn't debugged his code properly. Problems were cropping up all around the arcology, and the session ended with us thrust into the beginnings of a Run Away From the Crazy Robots Shadowrun adventure.</p>
<p>I haven't been that angry in a long time. Just as I had really hit my stride in TSoY and really made the Key system into a force for Awesome; just as I had sat back and begun to contemplate Whisken's arc and the implications of his actions; just as the game became something Important to me, rather than just a fun adventure, he pulled this.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, within five minutes of the switch he made a call for a meaningless task roll, something we had basically run out of town in TSoY (greatly improving the game) by explicitly setting stakes for each conflict.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm not going back to the "real" final session tonight.</p>

                            I think that even if I hadn't just got up and come here and read this post first instead of everything else I need to be doing, this story would still be the worst thing I encountered all day.<br/>

And at 11 I have to discuss a James Baldwin story that involves a lynching and castration.                        </div>

                            Oh man.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I'll admit I've considered it.  I think most people have, at one point or another thought about the "surprise twist, this is actually a _different_ game" - I've even gone so far as "Surprise twist: This game is taking place ins the cosmology of a different game than you expected, but never to the point where ti's this kind of violation of trust.<br/>
<br/>
Heh.  This is the part of things where I will cheerfully join the throng breaking out the "system does matter" bats - I suspect the GM, even if he's sharp enough to recognize it if he thinks about it - hasn't even considered that it will _play_ differently and that that could possibly be an issue.  My money says he's pleased as punch with getting to reveal his big surprise.  WHich is insanely frustrating - he probably is quite certain he's just provided an awesome game experience.<br/>
<br/>
So good luck.  If you're the only one frustrated, communication may get you nowhere, but hopefully, you'll get lucky.  <br/>

                            Is the GM a friend of yours, or just a guy you game with? <br/>
<br/>
Would there be any benefit at all of trying to communicate to him how profoundly he went wrong?<br/>
<br/>
How do you even begin to approach that?<br/>
<br/>
While I  have never been subjected to anything quite this heinous, there have been times I've been so deeply dissatisfied with a friend's GMing that I was at a loss for words. I didn't want to say what I really thought for fear of messing with the friendship or making him think he's irredeemable as a GM.                        </div>

                            Ugh.  This seems like a serious social issue.  I've done a handful of times a session or two where it was revealed that a bunch of what just happened was a dream.  I considered accepting such to be toeing the boundary of trust.  However, the main direction of the campaign (and mechanics used) was always agreed on openly by everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Out of curiousity:  How was the basic game agreed to in the first place?  i.e. How did you decide who was GM and what game you would be playing?  What I'm wondering at is how it happened that Jeff thought he could change out the system which everyone agreed to.  Would it have made a difference to you if he had switched to a different system:  The Pool or  Shock, say?  For my play, I can't see switching out at all without some sort of buy-in from the players.                        </div>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I'll continue responding and detailing context and everything, but it seems worthwhile to keep discussion in one thread, since they're really both about the same thing.
