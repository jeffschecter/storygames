Most of the players were new to Geiger Counter (except for Ping and I, who were seasoned veterans after the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6344" rel="nofollow">crystal ziggurat</a> game) but Will, Chad and Kingston jumped in with both feet -- technically six feet all together.<br/><br/>The title came from a fantastically appropriate Neil Young theme song from Chad's prom. It practically screams slasher flick, doesn't it?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lamemage.com/misc/prom_slasher.jpg"/><br/><br/>As I mentioned in another thread we used little chits of paper to see where people were (we did this in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6344" rel="nofollow">crystal ziggurat</a> too but forgot to mention it). Since there are so many characters it makes a lot easier to keep track of what just happened and where everyone was last seen when they are trying to frame who will show up where next -- it didn't prevent anyone from appearing in a new location as desired. A star on the chit means it's a potential survivor.<br/><br/>Lesson of the day: just like in the movies, never sneak into an empty classroom on prom night to have sex on a teacher's desk. Or sneak into the basement on prom night to have sex in the boiler room. Or sneak out by the lockers on prom night to think about having sex. Basically if the words "sneaking" and "sex" were in the sentence you were in for trouble.<br/><br/>Geiger Counter is definitely getting to be one of my go-to games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147721/#Comment_147721" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T14:19:40+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  2:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Geiger Counter is definitely getting to be one of my go-to games.</blockquote>\nSame here!  I think it's a perfect con game.  You don't have to do any advanced prep and doing setting creation at the table means that it's always tailored to the group you're playing with.  It has a satisfying rising and falling action that naturally emerges in play, and the whole thing can be done in 3-4 hours, even with a brand new group.<br/><br/>Solid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147722/#Comment_147722" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T14:20:09+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  2:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meant to mention that because of some bad paper planning our map got fairly chaotic (as you can see).

I think that caused some trouble: there was definitely a few "not on the same page" moments about the nature of the menace but we sorted it out on the fly.<br/><br/>It's kind of a key question about the two ways to play the game. In one case you all agree pretty clearly what the menace is ahead of time, and in the other (which we keep playing) the menace is basically an unknown and gets defined bit by bit, which is creative and fun but can also lead to total chaos (which I suppose is true of any game with rotating control).<br/><br/>We also had some strange rolls -- the first two conflicts (2 dice vs 8 die menace) came out ties because the protagonist rolled box cars both times, so the menace took early hits. I think towards the end there was also at least one time when I screwed up and didn't take the best two dice from among all the rolling players which hurt the good guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148684/#Comment_148684" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T20:39:35+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  8:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2008 8:41PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So cleaning up and distilling the elements from the game we played, here's what a prom slasher style sheet might look like.

Lots of creepy gazing in windows or skulking just out of sight.<br/><br/>Actually correction -- it didn't hassle anyone who could fight back. The non-survivor stoner kid died after sneaking off to light up behind the auditorium.

Our <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6344" rel="nofollow">alien crystal ziggurat</a> game was actually more fun because we defined the menace as we went along.<br/><br/>I think maybe it needs to be an explicit part of the game setup: are you agreeing on the menace ahead of time or letting it emerge creatively?
