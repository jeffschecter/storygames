Mom is convinced she hates RPG's, my younger bro has played a few, and my dad was willing to play but not totally sure exactly how.<br/>\n  Series creation took about an hour and a half, at which point we stopped.  Mom was surprised by how much fun it was, and I think everyone's looking forward to playing next week.  Here's the setup:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Show Name: High Crossings<br/>\n  Premise: A death at an El Paso high school causes the worlds of crime, justice, and faith to collide.<br/>\n  We opened the game by going around the table naming social issues that interest us.  We ended up with things like prohibition (which was later changed to drugs), abortion, inflation, and health care.  We ended up deciding that a good lens to explore these issues through would be a poor, drug-ridden community.  We ended up choosing El Paso because a few missionaries from our church work there and because we're a little bit familiar with the environment from them.<br/>\n  The rest of the game was dedicated to discussing the event that kicks off the series and the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The characters were...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mom: Officer Vaugn, a white police officer whose wife has left him with two sons.  Vaugn's Issue is that, even though he wants to do justice to the drug lords, he can't because he knows he and his family will be killed.  As a result, he acts as if ignoring problems makes them go away.<br/>\n  He's been ignoring the fact that his older son has been slowly sucked into drug culture, and now he's paying for it.  The first scene of the series is his oldest son overdosing at the local school.  She is now caught between "ignoring" the problem of the drug lord or taking revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dad: Father Aciano, a half-white half-Mexican priest who teaches at the school and is close to many of the kids.  His issue is "Is my calling worth my happiness?"  He feels as if, despite his best efforts, he's not doing any good to save the kids.  He is drifting away from his calling as a priest towards a more materialistic lifestyle.  One of his Edges is "Knowledge of Community" because everyone, including both the other protagonists, confess to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Younger Brother: Alonso, a drug lord in the community.  His wife has also left him with one son, Raymundo.  He lives an affluent lifestyle on the outside, but is walking a fine line when it comes to business.  Everone's children go to Father Aciano's school, even the children of Alonso's "employees."  While he has promised that no drugs will be sold in school, he is in fact secretly employing a man to sell to all the kids but Alonso's son, a young man who is tired of living in his father's shadow.  If Alonso's workers find out that he is exposing their kids to drugs, there could be rebellion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, there's our basic setup.  Right now I don't feel the need to apply much outside pressure as there's a lot of conflict already worked into the characters, but maybe I'm wrong.  Do any of you more weathered PTA'ers have any suggestiosn on how to Produce this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242340/#Comment_242340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T04:35:31+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  4:35AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You have a really nice setup there.  The episodes may well write themselves.  If I were Producer, I'd prepare a few possible bangs for each character (tasty, Issue-related events that the characters cannot ignore) in case things slacken and build a list of names and locations everybody can draw from.  <br/><br/>I condensed the key rules and taped them to the outside of my book, because it is very easy to forget the fiddly details like determining Budget, how to handle ties and stuff.  <br/><br/>Another piece of advice that works for me (your mileage may vary) is to end an episode where it wants to end, regardless of Producer budget remaining.  If they map one to one, awesome, but if they don't, err on the side of ending the episode well - even if you have mojo to spare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242382/#Comment_242382" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T09:16:36+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  9:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noah,<br/>\n  Awesome! I would suggest that you spend budget aggressively in the first epi. The issues is, you need to train the players to give each other fan mail. But they can't give fan mail if you haven't spent budget. and to be honest, fan mail is a great mechanic that needs to be given its due. If used correctly, Fan mail is the core of the game (it is an awesome way for players to communicate what they want from the game if the other players are listening).<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242386/#Comment_242386" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T09:22:48+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  9:22AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave's suggestion is excellent - the economy of PTA is a little opaque until you've seen it in action, and priming the pump is critical early on.

Avoid letting the PCs get into player vs. player conflicts.  Since PTA doesn't do PvP, you'll expend alot of time trying to set orthogonal stakes on PvP conflicts.  And its time better spent in more PC vs producer conflicts.<br/><br/>Making external situations a mirror (or dark mirror) for a players issue is always a good way to bring players to the spotlight.<br/><br/>Yes, get the fan mail out their early.<br/><br/>Use flashbacks if you can to flesh the characters out.  Remember there doesn't have to be a conflict in every scene, but the economy will stagnate if conflicts don't happen fairly regularly.<br/><br/>Sounds like a great set up of plot and characters you've got.<br/><br/>Let us know how it plays out.<br/><br/>Jeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242406/#Comment_242406" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T11:29:36+00:00" title="November 17, 2009 11:29AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2009 11:30AM by misuba.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Know this crucial rule that everyone misses:<br/><br/>There are no "opposing stakes" - when the acting player loses, <i>and not before</i>, what happens is decided by whoever wins narration.<br/><br/>Also, I find it helpful to let the players know up front that when they request their scene, they can put their expectations out there as to whether or not it'll have a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242437/#Comment_242437" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T13:39:32+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  1:39PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also,<br/>\n  This might not happen with your group. But with my group, we had an issue with forced continuity. Meaning when the Producer asked a player what scene they wanted, they felt compelled to have that scene immediately after the previous scene. This caused all kinds of headaches, like not everyone was able to get the "In next week's episode" to come true... Because they couldn't narrate all the varied stuff into the new scene and still have it temporally and spatially congress with the immediately preceding scene. Once we let go of that, a lot of that cleared up, but it was a big stumbling block.<br/>\n  Good luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242438/#Comment_242438" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T13:48:55+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  1:48PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Similarly - while it may be heresy, I do not go clockwise around the table giving each person a scene.

I hadn't been expecting so much advice, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering how many people play PTA.  All of this advice is awesome.  I think it's crucial for this first game to run really smoothly.  My family isn't going to want to focus on rules, so the more natural the game feels the more they can focus on what they have had fun with: discussing and discovering their characters.<br/>\n  Now, I've seen a few references to outside pressures, little bangs that the characters can't ignore.  Should these be NPC-related or circumstantial?  In a game where the GM has very little control over the actual plot, is it good to give the players a few details, then let them figure out what's going on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242526/#Comment_242526" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T04:36:08+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  4:36AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, create some big, memorable NPCs who live to mess with your players.
