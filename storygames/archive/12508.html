I like the heart behind the game. I'm... not sure about what the system is like. I like their conceits with the mindset of a more traditional everygame mindset: Not "tons of races! tons of classes!" but rather "heroes embedded in their culture", "experience == how many stories there are about you", "NO HOT CHICKS IN SKIMPY ARMOR" etc.<br/><br/>I'm interested in knowing more, for sure. But I think the idea and preso has enough heart behind it (plus, the designer is an anthro student, near and dear to my sociology background) that I will likely throw some in as a sponsor.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280977/#Comment_280977" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T15:46:53+00:00" title="July 15, 2010  3:46PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to know more about how to game plays before I kick some money their way.

I've got only a few minutes before meeting my dad at the bar, so let this be only a quick teaser:<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of and enjoy Glorantha. I guess my only comment is that when I play Glorantha, I imagine the action as animated. I wanted to design a game that made people imagine a live-action world. I think that reflects both a personal preference of mine and how I was introduced to the game, of course. When I read the Bhagavad Gita or the Iliad, I never imagine the events as some high-action anime. Whenever I play most RPGs, however, I do. I guess I figured there might be a way to design/present a game that could help encourage the former.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting isn't general at all. We've built up five major cultures with histories, structures, economies, good sides, and bad sides. We started with questions such as: What if different people migrated across the Bering Strait? What if People A conquered People B, instead of B conquering A? What if this religion was not stopped by those mountains? What if... In the end, each of our cultures borrowed heavily from two historical cultures, one traditionally glamorized and masculinized, and another traditionally demonized or feminized. For example, our Vayok people will look rather Norse from certain angles and rather Inuit from others. They turned out very interesting, and so did their songs, the way they dress, their economy, their narrative tradition, their gender norms, etc. So, the cultures are anything but generic and offer quite a few restrictions actually. (For Andy- we borrow from Bourdieu's notion of "habitus," Foucault's "milieu," and Goffman's "footing" in character creation).<br/>\n<br/>\nContributors designing characters: I'm not too worried about them being lame. We'll have editorial control over everything, and I like the idea of having other voices inside our rulebook. This has always been a communal thing for me. Most people will get three or four blurbs like, "Jared's character Hanosk scrambles over the table to avoid the angry husband's hatchet. Jared rolls Move-Labor against the husband's Fight-Labor and scores 2 Hits." And then at the end of the book, we may have the full character sheet added as a sample character in a short example scenario. Not to be contradictory, but I kinda like the idea of having a lame character or two in the book (how often does a GM create a nondescript, lame character, only to have him/her become one of the PCs favorite recurring NPCs over time?). If someone tests out the game and helps us out with debugging, then I think they should not only feel like partial-owners but actually have something to show for it. I'm sure there are cynical ways to spin that, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I can answer some mechanical questions as well but it'll have to wait until tomorrow. Again, thanks for the questions. I'm really digging this site, and I hope I can contribute outside my role in Anthropos Games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280999/#Comment_280999" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T19:19:06+00:00" title="July 15, 2010  7:19PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CalvinAnthropos</cite>The setting isn't general at all.

Some really nice art! You've obviously gone to town there.<br/><br/>The die-type prejudice was a bit less attractive. Bit of advice: throttle back on the angle of, "Our game is a unique new approach better than what's gone before" (that's a theme I noticed, not a direct quote). Savvy online folks have seen this sort of thing many times and know that it's pretty much never true and comes from people who don't have a good awareness of the RPG field.

I'll respond to what I can here, but fuller answers may have to wait until the new website launches. Here goes:<br>\n<br>\nRules/Tidbits: Characters re-roll their total hitpoints/"thresholds" each time they rest, so you can have good days and bad days. Also, casting magick eats at you from the inside out, whereas taking physical damage injures you from the outside in; this leads to a little "burning the candle at both ends" resource management. Thirdly, the roll is a "Roll for Opportunity," which means each roll is more like a scan of the field that lets you know what openings you see and what opportunities arise. I think that philosophy is a slightly different take then we've seen before.<br>\n<br>\nEpithets: We don't have levels. You gain renown by interacting with famous people, objects, enemies, etc. When you get enough Renown, you get to unlock a new Epithet (a moniker, title, or alias). These are totally up to the players to invent, although the book is filled with suggestions. When you unlock the Epithet, you set what bonuses it will eventually offer and really build out what that Epithet will mean quantitatively. You have to do bigger and badder things to unlock more Epithets. "Pages" are gained through role-playing out your character's social ties (to his or her caste, profession, relationships, rivalries) and used to mature those unlocked Epithets. It plays out that Renown is earned by doing huge feats and quests, while Pages are earned by role-playing your character's relationships, duties, responsibilities, etc. <br>\n<br>\nIn medias res: Character creation starts with some random rolls to zoom in on a continent and region and eventually down to a very unique, individual situation. For example, one scenario for Ugurlu is: "While a Vayok ship is unloaded at the docks, a beast breaks free from its cage, killing a handful of laborers and attracting the guard."  The players then imagine this little scenario, fleshing out who is there, what they are doing, why they are there, etc. until each has an idea of the part they will play. One guy is the dockmaster. One girl is the owner of the beast. One guy is a member of the guard, brother to the dockmaster. Each has a motive and a role to play right off the bat. The rest of character creation is then guided by "What would THAT person need/be like/desire/know?" We like to think you are finding the hero in a crowd, not inventing one from scratch.<br>\n<br>\nMechanic influences: I've enjoyed a few editions of D&amp;D, White Wolf games going back to Wraith: The Oblivion, Shadowrun, Glorantha, Champions, Heroes Unlimited (The TMNT edition and the corebook), Burning Wheel... I really liked Mekton, FATE is interesting, Earthdawn was always a great game and is now even better... I mean, I guess they are all influences. I have to say I haven't played too many of the OGL games. I didn't really take a liking to Conan. You can see the basic mechanic of Early Dark up on Kickstarter now. We tried to make the mechanic more like dominoes: something simple with limitless iterations. Especially after we decided to make all actions have a Footing (two-aptitude set), dominoes really became my top influence. We wanted something tactile, something more than just rolling for high numbers-- we wanted building or touching something, haptic stuff. We may even introduce tiles, though I think things work just fine through visualization as of now.<br>\n<br>\nQuick start: Our quick start now is 92 pages. Too long. We'll make a quick start available on the website sometime soon. <br>\n<br>\nUniqueness: I don't believe there is a perfect RPG. A lot of gamers and writers have one goal in life: to make the Great American RPG. I don't think that exists. And that's great! It means we get to keep creating new things. Each game makes choices and focuses on some areas at the cost of others, which means each game focuses on some audiences at the cost of others. I'm fine with that, and I think each game is unique and interesting for how it answers the questions it asks. We're not making a "lite" game, or a simple game, or a one-off game. That said, we don't plan on publishing 38 books with thousands of feats, skills, and spells to separate the real fans from the casual guys/gals. The system should be full enough for anyone to come up with a thousand spells from the effects we do cover. We'll see. Yes, I think I mentioned something about "evolutionary leaps" and "eXtreme innovative deZign" or something, but you'll have to take that with the attitude it was given in. <br>\n<br/>\nDie-type Prejudice: Thanks, man. I'll take that to heart. We aren't haters here. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks much. We will try to get the website done as fast as we can. I'm in Michigan now doing research (which does involve GenCon!) while Chris and Travis are in Austin. It's slowing us down a bit, but I'm sure Chris will have something very pretty up real soon.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281171/#Comment_281171" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T15:24:11+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  3:24PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2010 10:34AM by Mcdaldno.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [retracted for douch-y-ness]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281201/#Comment_281201" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T21:00:44+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  9:00PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eeeeasy.

I like inventing them for scratch because they are "mine," yet at the same time I can see where you are coming from logically. You just skipped over all the uninteresting moments until this triggered moment where play begins. My only concern is that coming from a fairly standard game group with mainstream tastes--how do you feel this concept of  leaping in media res for an entire game can be sold to them? Won't this make it a bit harder to understand what is obviously a unique setting--to ask players to jump into the game without a little more "easement" into the setting?  I think this is why some games stay popular--you don't need enormous back stories to jump into playing very easy roles (Elf, Dwarf, Cleric, Fighter, Thief, Valkyrie  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )  <br/><br/>Love the art by the way, you've done a good job building something that looks fun though, so i can't wait to see what it has in store.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281221/#Comment_281221" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T23:56:21+00:00" title="July 16, 2010 11:56PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for responding, Calvin.

Early Dark isn't really "alternative" or "weird" in my eyes, though our second title, Centennial Gothic (Victorian horror and Wild West with some Edo samurai taking over California yadda yadda) will be more unorthodox: only playing cards and poker chips for mechanical elements, no "to-hit" rolls, no individual turns, no set skills or abilities, etc. If ED isn't your thing, no hard feelings.

You could cut it into separate sections, for situation creation, and... I guess there's no distinct character creation phase? So, whatever different phases come naturally.

Based on reading their Kickstart and website, it seems very likely to suffer the traditional flaws. Consider the following text from the website; apparently one of the goals was to:<br><br>"Create a dynamic game engine that drives dramatic narrative while reproducing realistic conflict and human limitations"<br/><br/>This is apparently a game specifically inspired by (and attempting to emulate) mythology. Why would "realistic combat" be even remotely interesting in this game? Why would I want that? The die mechanic is, in a technical sense, novel. But it's at base just a complicated version of "roll stat+skill against difficulty". It's very much task resolution, not conflict resolution. In a game about myth and culture, why would I want that?<br/><br/>Maybe the ruleset is just not well-served by the marketing. But it seems pretty likely that this is one of those "Cool setting, arbitrary mechanics" sorts of things. Now, the setting seems legitimately cool, and I'm definitely intrigued by the character creation thing, so it might be worth checking out. But I am pretty sure this will be one of those games that I crib from, rather than actually playing as written.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281389/#Comment_281389" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T22:55:17+00:00" title="July 17, 2010 10:55PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calvin.

Thanks.<br/><br/>PeterBB: Yeah, criticisms from a good attitude are very welcome. Iron on iron is good. As far as the arbitrary mechanic goes, I think there are a few things going on that have yet to be discussed. Whether you'll like that system or find it novel is up in the air, but I believe it will be apparent that we really labored over settling on <i>the</i> mechanic for the game's spirit. This isn't the place for a long essay about Early Dark's themes, but I kinda wish it were. I have six or seven little things I'm thinking of, but I'll address one here (I am terribly verbose at times, pardon).<br/><br/>Mythological heroes are very active but rarely in control of what they're doing. Just a little observation I've gathered. Arjuna was NOT all about slaughtering his family in the Bhagavad Gita. Abraham did NOT want to kill his son in the book of Genesis. Odysseus... you get the point. We wanted that in our game. We didn't want players to come up with a plan "I want to hit it with my axe" and then roll to see if that plan worked (one might argue that people do much less of that than they think). We didn't really cover how combat works slightly differently than other Checks in the mechanics intro, but in Early Dark there are no plans or "to hit" rolls as such. You choose a Footing and then roll "for Opportunity." It is only after the roll that you decide what to do (depending on what options are open to you). You sort of roll up a context and then decide how to make the most of it, making each choice (even for the attacker) "always already" a reaction to something else. That is a big philosophical argument that we tried to represent faithfully in our die mechanic. <br/><br/>That may sound lofty or aggrandizing or something, but it's just one of many little things like that that Travis and I argued about for over a year because we really wanted the mechanic to fit the approach we desired for the game and the "otherworldly but familiar" setting. <br/><br/>Our healing mechanic just popped into mind: characters in Early Dark don't have a pool of Hit Points that get depleted in combat and restored in an equal-but-opposite way by healing (instead of minus five hit points of damage, the healing gives you plus five hit points). Our Vitality system is quite different from that to begin with (I won't argue it's insanely novel, but it does have its twists), but let's stick to healing here. So, anyway, healing doesn't just reverse damage that you take. This is a philosophical issue for us, and it fits with the themes of much mythology: loss and pain are part of progressive steps forward, not errors that must be erased. We wanted that notion built into the mechanic, and so we set up our rules for healing accordingly. Will that be overt in the final book? Probably not. But it's in there.<br/><br/>Many games focused on personal character development, for example, give experience points for characters losing or failing at something, and I think that is a great way to blend the mechanics of a game with that focus of the game/setting. Our experience system attempts a solution along those lines as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, just my initial responses. I kept it to only two things (yay).<br/><br/>So, whether it works or not is for you to decide later, but just some things that came to mind. Thanks for the close reading too. You guys are really sharp, and this has been great to talk about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281401/#Comment_281401" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T02:13:36+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  2:13AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, indeed, folks here are so sharp somebody could cut them.

That's cool. I want to read the system just for that.<br/><br/>However, I think my worry was on a slightly more fundamental level. It sounds like you guys really honed the traditional model into something pretty creative and tailored. But my question is why you chose the traditional model in the first place. For instance, why is combat handled differently than other things? "You are always already reacting, but only when you're holding a sword" has a bit less of a ring to it. Was that a conscious choice? As far as I can tell, there isn't even a social conflict system (correct me if I'm wrong) to balance out the focus on combat. Was that too a conscious choice? <br/><br/>Similarly, you use number values in pre-defined skills. What is the rationale for this? Why is "Guile 6" the best way to describe Odysseus' legendary guile? What's the argument for carving up the world of mythology and quantitatizing it in that way rather than another? (Instead of, for instance: custom traits/skills like Dogs in the Vineyard or Unknown Armies, "moves" like Apocalypse World, special abilities in-fiction like Don't Rest Your Head, etc.) <br/><br/>Considering your example for a moment: Why have a roll for "jumping over a wall" in the first place? What function does it serve? The focus of the scene is on the enemy he is running from. Why not have the mechanics also focus on that? (In other words, why is the fact that he's using "labor" more mechanically interesting than the fact that he's trying to escape, or is acting with fear, etc.?)<br/><br/>It's entirely possible that you've considered all of these factors in far greater detail than I have. But I get suspicious, because in the end you have settled on something (skill+stat rolled against difficulty level or opponent in a task-resolution based system) that seems distinguishable only in the details from D&amp;D or Shadowrun. (This is, of course, according only to the few bits we've seen, and I freely admit there may be surprises).<br/><br/>I wouldn't be devoting the time to reading or deconstructing what you guys are doing if I weren't interested. You guys seem to have a very solid idea, and I would love to see more philosophically/anthropologically informed RPGs. I am intrigued by the setting, and one or two of your mechanical ideas also pop out at me. I'm just not willing to shell out actual cash for a game that seems to have a non-zero chance of being yet another traditional "combat-sim-by-default" game. It seems like it's too late to change much about the game (correct me if I'm wrong), so my desire is mostly to entice you to give us more details and answer our worries. I apologize if I come across as overly negative or cynical. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281406/#Comment_281406" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T03:05:27+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  3:05AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think the video said the rules are same for combat and other conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalvin I think your direction with early dark is interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nabout how long is an average game session,<br/>\n<br/>\ngiven your game attempts to model how people think realistically. what type of stories result? should we expect games to follow a mythological story ark something like the "hero's journey"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281407/#Comment_281407" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T03:18:27+00:00" title="July 18, 2010  3:18AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (<a href="/forums/profile/Tyler">@Tyler</a>: Couldn't find it in a rewatching of the video, but I might have missed it.)<br><br><a href="/forums/profile/Calvin">@Calvin</a>, one thing I'm _really_ interested in is the online meta-plot thing.

In combat, you declare the Footing first (the mode you're in) and then Roll for Opportunity. This happens outside combat quite a bit, but more often than not you've already said what you're doing before the roll is called. That just happens when people are all playing and storytelling together, and we didn't want to stunt that. In those situations, things move from "role to roll" as we say: the qualitative role-playing you just did determines the Footing of the following roll. That has actually been fun because it holds people (at least a little) accountable for their outbursts. <br><br>Yeah, ED is being tinkered with to rid ourselves of anything extraneous but not up for huge changes. I wrote this earlier, but the response was destroyed: Our second title, Centennial Gothic, is a Victorian Horror/Western game (Deadwood meets Dracula or something), and it is much less "traditional" in the sense I think Peter and others imply. Centennial Gothic has no attributes as it were, no skills, relies on qualitative "virtues" to handle conflict, uses playing cards and poker chips instead of dice, has no turn-taking, etc. It is our foray into "alterna" or "weird" rpg structures. <br><br>ED was not that project, though I think there are a few things that will come out in play unable to address here without way too many words. The biggest thing that makes me reluctant to call it a "stat+skill" thing is because of the Tacks and how every turn is a combination of multiple actions, some of which might succeed while others fail. We set out to avoid the all-or-nothing, single-minded, roll-to-see-if-my-idea-happens thing. That was our goal here, and Centennial Gothic will be our vehicle to take things even farther.  <br/><br/>The online living campaign comes from one definition of a "virtual world" I came upon during research: the world must be "persistent," which means it continues on even when you aren't playing in it. That's the idea behind the living campaign. Things are happening even when you aren't playing. Not in an annoying way, just in an "optional cool random things that turn out to be a sweet global story" thing. We want players to inhabit our world: Build a house and tell us where it is. Found a city. We'll let you know if an earthquake hits or a great power awakens at the bottom of the lake. You can choose to bring those events into your home campaign or just ignore them. If you tell us about your interactions, however, your heroes might get a little more exposure. I figure we're a small enough company to offer something like that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281443/#Comment_281443" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-18T10:29:10+00:00" title="July 18, 2010 10:29AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Tim">@Tim</a>: I'm really trying to avoid that, but I definitely see where you're coming from.
