The Crossroads in this case is a cafe where the man sitting at the table at the back can give you anything you want, if you perform the task he gives you. It's unashamedly <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://theboothattheend.com/" rel="nofollow">The Booth at the End RPG</a>, a short, mostly freeform scenario for four players.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven a character who wanted to get rich, I was a little taken aback when Neil, as the Man, told me that my task was to get a child addicted to illegal drugs. This was challenging for a number of reasons: partly that my character was a family man who workd in IT, so no obvious criminal background to call upon, but mostly because <i>I'm</i> a child care professional. Fortunately, I had the time while the other three players were each having their first scene with the Man to wrestle this conumdrum around and consider how I could square it (for the record, I was also the only one whose character refused the Man's deal in the first scene; everyone else's said "I'll think about it")<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my second scene, I threw in the idea that my character had tried to score some drugs, so Neil suggested I rolled to see how that had turned out (there is a very simple 2d6 system with graded levels of success). It turned out that I'd failed miserably and had been caught in a sting operation, so I had a court summons and my wife had taken our daughter to stay with her mother. This was the first point at which I could see a clear way forward for the character and over his next three scenes, I charted his downfall, starting with doing some dodgy favours for a few mates and ending with his being a rich underworld figure, but had lost his family to one of the others character's, whose wish had been to find his soul mate!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a challenging game to play, especially as there is nothing stopping you from doing anything you like in-character, so it was entirely in the players' hands as to where their story went and how much effort they put into carrying out the Man's task or defying him. Despite having no scenes where any two of the PCs met, we had plenty of influence on each other, as elements of each story got re-incorporated into the other stories. A good dramatic improv session with just enough structure to guide the narrative to some satisfying conclusions. :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346519/#Comment_346519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T04:49:19+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  4:49AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, many thanks for the feedback, and thanks for playtesting!<br><br>Per                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346543/#Comment_346543" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T12:25:18+00:00" title="October 20, 2011 12:25PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More detail on the scenario from the facilitator's point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game seemed to play out very well, with all four players getting their characters into deeper and more sinister situations. Sandy set off a firebomb in a department store then found true love with David's ex-wife, only to die when Deborah cut the brake lines on his van (with the remaining home-made explosives in the back). Deborah also very nearly shot the Man in the restaurant, but instead shot at (and missed) a passerby who was trying to calm the situation. Patricia, Sandy's mum, ended up in jail after trying and failing to hold up the local Girobank with a wooden AK47 and an Obama mask.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all four people attempted their tasks, and three succeeded and got what they wanted!<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos to James Mullen, Aiva Grasberga, Richard Kettle, and Lisa St John, the four excellent players. It was even Aiva's first go at a RPG, and in her second language!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scenario is intended to be played at the next Fastaval, in a minimal-prep two-hour slot. It fitted that nicely, with us taking about 90 - 120 minutes to come to some nicely satisfying conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the audience, the mechanics are inspired by Apocalypse World. The facilitator is charged to ask questions of the players, without suggesting much, if anything. Most play happens in flashback, with the PCs recounting to the Man what they've been up to since the last time they met. When the player describes some action their PC attempts, they roll 2d6, with 10+ being a success, 7-9 a mixed success, and 6- being a failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of issues that came up in the game that may need clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a good many crosses between the stories this time. I think it helped that I explicitly said at the start of play that the players should look for opportunities to create crosses between stories. That seemed to make the stories more inter-related than was the case in the playtest at Nerdinburgh.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames made a good suggestion to do with the bonus slips. (Each player gets a +1, a +2 and a +3 bonus on a slip of paper; each can be used once for a bonus on a dice roll.) Rather than having the relatively bland descriptions in the slips, James suggested that the player can get a bonus by creating a new cross and incorporating something in another players' story into their own. The sheets would have +1, +2, +3 written on them. When the bonus is claimed, the cross is written next to the number.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a little bit of confusion about who narrates the outcome of a dice roll. The general flow is that the player narrates everything for their PC (with leading questions from the facilitator), but the example of play has the facilitator narrating the outcome of the dice roll. I presume the facilitator should be narrating at that point, but it's different from the normal flow of play, so should perhaps be pointed out in the booklet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players commented that, despite the crosses, there wasn't much for each player to do outside their own scenes. My fault, I should have been quicker on the uptake about giving them NPCs to play. It may be worth a sentence or two in the book to point out this option.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother place where I dropped the ball was not making clear that scenes didn't have to start in the restaurant then move to a flashback. Players could frame scenes straight in flashback. I should have made that clear at the start of the game. Again, a sentence or two may help the facilitator.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe task "Blow up a store" was generally thought to be the weakest of the four, as it could very easily become the victimless crime it was in our playtest. The other tasks will all include a victim. (I'm not sure that 'prevent harm to a person' tasks would work well, as there's nothing to prompt the player to do anything other than 'the person is fine' actions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed a tendency for some of the players to describe what their character was planning to do, not what they had actually done. I don't know if that's an issue with the everything-in-flashback structure, or players expecting the 'GM' to provide a direction for them to react to. It wasn't a problem in play, as all the facilitator has to do is have the Man ask the PC, 'Yes, but what have you <b>done?</b>' But again, it might be worth pointing it out in the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut those are all small quibbles in what was, again, an excellent couple of hours entertainment. The players were shocked at the tasks, but leapt into play with gusto, even if their characters are more reticent. Everyone had a good time, everyone enjoyed watching the other players' scenes, and everyone enjoyed getting their characters into nasty situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell done, Per!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346552/#Comment_346552" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T14:08:53+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  2:08PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arg, connection trouble ate my answer...<br><br>This is great feedback - the game seems to do what I want it to do.
