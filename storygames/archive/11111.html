Like, crazy tight and crazy strong.<br/><br/>So you know what is going to happen, and in what order. And it will happen very quickly. What you don't know is how you will approach and finally resolve the awful choice you are forced to make at endgame, and every piece of the rules supports making this choice matter deeply. The game's rules provide a light touch (they are minimal), but every point of contact is effective and meaningful.<br/><br/>The game's structure is predicated on a relationship map, and answering questions prompted by your character and where he or she is positioned on that map. The characters you choose to play impact the tenor of the session - will you have a romance game? A game about faith? A game about war? A game about fidelity and sacrifice? I love that.<br/><br/>It's a very spare, very effective design. I've played a dozen times and still really enjoy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246746/#Comment_246746" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T07:15:48+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  7:15AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 7:19AM by Alex F.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drama resolution (talk it out, with defined authority-passing) plus masses of structure and predestiny turns out to make a really nifty space for play, and one that supports the theme really well. Seige and slow surrender needs some space to breathe, and Montsegur delivers.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say it's a conch game. Because of the interwoven nature of the characters, and the level of detail at which the fiction concentrates (these people, these fears), what happens on another player's turn can reshape your options and slide you down paths you hadn't expected. That's lovely, and feels like a core feature of roleplaying presented in a naked and functional form.<br/><br/>My character Philippa had a chance meeting with the prostitute Arsende, in which they almost found a moment of unity, only for Philippa to archly expose the social divide that fell between them. In Graham's turn, he had Arsene sleep with my seeming deus ex machina, a templar who favoured me. In my turn, narrating my departure from Montsegur, Graham's action had nestled in my brain. The templar, in the arms of his brothers, broke down and confessed his corruption, implicating Philippa in the process, who burned without Consolamentum.<br/><br/>The stepwise process from turn to turn, the space to think and draw threads together, together with knowing the shape of the game, made things like this possible, easy even.<br/><br/>Best<br/>Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246772/#Comment_246772" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T08:33:42+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  8:33AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks for the feedback.<br/><br/>To back it up a little, are there any online reviews (here, at RPGNet etc) that summarize the game in full?

In my most recent game I had a lovely scene where I'd set it up to shame my character's husband (I was also Philippa, a philandering evil Philippa) with her brazen infidelity and mock him for his devotion to the faith. The scene's starting to cook and Adam Dray steals narration rights and injects the Voice of God, then hands the scene back to us. Which changed everything. Another player's input, driven by the game both thematically (the "Voice of God" event card) and procedurally (the ability to interrupt, a finite resource) just rocked my world as a player and forced me to completely re-assess what was going on and who my character really was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246782/#Comment_246782" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T08:44:24+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  8:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/index.html" rel="nofollow">AP</a><br/><a href="http://gameslinger-enterprises.com/2009/03/13/montsegur-1244-parts-1-and-2/" rel="nofollow">Tevis</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246865/#Comment_246865" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:24:02+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:24PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another AP: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6647" rel="nofollow">The Best Siege Ever</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246870/#Comment_246870" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:34:46+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:34PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. It feels halfway between a board game and a freeform narration game. There's just enough constraint to push the story along. Like anything, it's not 100% unique, but it feels new, in the way Polaris does.<br/><br/>2. The system gives you lots of things to insert into narration. For example, "Witchcraft" or "Blood running in a stream". That sparks the imagination.<br/><br/>The setting is unusual. It's really unusual to have religion taking such a central part in a game. It makes it feel very different from other games.<br/><br/>3. None of Arsende's sexual activity was described onscreen. I liked that. She talked one of the younger characters into seeing sex as a way to express her womanhood. That was dark and interesting at the same time.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246872/#Comment_246872" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:36:37+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:36PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2009 1:21PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the hot points, to me, is micro-cultural. Because the game is so specific and due to how it's set up, people who have played the game can talk about how their experiences went with other people who have played the game. This is not dissimilar to the Keep on the Borderlands (or Shadowfell) effect, where people who have played or run it can talk about how different encounters went and what people did.<br/><br/>While that doesn't necessarily account for the start of the M1244 craze, I think it's a huge contributing factor to why it stayed Teh Hawtness for as long as it did. People would talk about this shared micro-cultural experience online in a very excited way, having long discussions about how their group handled (for instance) Phillipa's questions or which primary characters they had or whatever. Which also drives one to try the game again in different circumstances. I have played now three times, and have seen some really interesting ways in which play can radically differ.<br/><br/>But play with nearly any RPG can radically differ from one session/group/situation to the next. The killer app part of M1244 is that is has the same starting point &amp; same structure, so there's the ability to converse about <em>story</em> differences rather than mechanical/structural talk. It's a game to play to be part of an interesting conversation.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I'm finding the same conversations with Dragon Age: Origins. I'm fascinated talking with people who did different backgrounds, used different party members &amp; chose different branches in the game. The shared context of the overall plot/CRPG system bridges gaps and makes talking about differences in story fruitful -- and, frankly, conversational rather than a meaningless exchange of vignettes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246874/#Comment_246874" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T12:44:46+00:00" title="December 15, 2009 12:44PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting, Ryan.

The Templar may be crazy; the event card doesn't nail that down.  I played the Templar as a forthright and unblooded grail nerd, thinking he might become a sombre witness to the slaughter, the sad outsider who survives but doesn't escape intact. <br/><br/>Sadly, the Templar wound up in the care of Pierre, authored by Wilhelm. This Pierre had some....baggage about Catholics.  Pierre and the Templar go to the catacombs, making polite conversation.  I'm digging on the dialog between them, how mundane and verite' it is.  Then, without warning, Pierre smashes the Templar's head in with a rock, killing him mid-sentence, and dumps the body in a bottomless well.<br/><br/>At first I was shocked and WTFing, but then I realized that this was probably a pretty meaningful thing for Wil's Pierre, and I'd totally innocently stumbled into provoking him just with the inspiration of the event card.  What other bombs were on the character cards?  What other fuses were on the event cards? I watched everything after that carefully. I'd never been in audience mode like that for a game before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
