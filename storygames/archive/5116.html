Now, I know how this can easily work in a mixed group of teens: The boys talk much more than the girls. Or some alpha player takes over the show while the silent kids stay silent. I don't want that.<br/><br/>I know techniques from other games that are used to moderate how much focus different characters and players get - like PTA's screen presence, round-robin GM-less games etc. However, none of these seem to fit in this straight, GMed, party-play-style game.<br/><br/>So I'm looking to brainstorm good ways to make sure everyone gets about the same amount of... narrative space, so to speak. <br/><br/>Any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doplegager" title="doplegager"><img alt="doplegager" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doplegager">doplegager</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115479/#Comment_115479" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T01:22:32+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  1:22AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm picturing DnD as a fantasy RPG, with the assumption that the party includes different 'classes' with different abilities, and that a party will be 'balanced'.<br/><br/>I'm not heavily familiar with PTA, but my understanding is that different characters have more influence in different episodes.  It's a little simple, but might it be possible to do the same thing, but scale it down to individual challenges instead of episodes?  As in, clerics have ability X.  Based on the schedule, it's time for the cleric to be center stage, so this challenge will heavily involve ability X?  Maybe Fighters have ability Y, and the next challenge is XXY (a few goblins around a desecrated shrine).  It's taking a basic dungeon design tip and using mechanics to make it an essential part of play (<i>e.g beating the game over the head with it</i>).<br/><br/>The second thought that goes through my head would be that in any given scene, the spotlighted character gains a bonus during that scene.  For example, maybe a character has a +6 to all rolls, with small pool of +2 or +4 bonuses to distribute as needed during the scene; ideally, they gain a mechanical incentive to be more active, but the bonus is flexible enough that other character's key abilities can come into play.  Naturally, bonus type and size is a reflection of whatever other mechanics are being used.<br/><br/>Just a few ideas.  Feel free to abuse or disabuse as you see fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115480/#Comment_115480" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T01:33:23+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  1:33AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool.

Maybe you could let them choose their screen presence session to session.  <br/><br/>Building on that, maybe choosing a 3 means you are going to be highly active but not central all night, and choosing a 1 means that you will be largely dormant but crucially important in one scene.  So in a four-player group, everyone gets 25% of the attention, but one guy gets it at 3% per scene and another guy gets it at 25% all at once.  This gives the "all at once" guy a chance to sit back and think about what he'd like to happen, as well as just observe and be quiet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115502/#Comment_115502" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T05:39:09+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  5:39AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, why do you feel screen presence would not work for a GMed game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115506/#Comment_115506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T06:19:58+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  6:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aeternal Legends has an Expertise rule designed to deal with this.

Spending a chip / die lets you take action to respond to a challenge posed by the GM, or in a more conflict-resolution approach, after the GM's posed a challenge, spending a chip puts you in a scene where your character will make a significant contribution to surmounting the challenge (if you don't, maybe you get your chip back).  Each challenge the players meet requires a certain number of chips to overcome [in addition to any other mechanics you have for determining success], so multiple players will have to band together on some things, but no player who's involved in a challenge can contribute less than a certain portion of the chips needed.  The point is to prevent situations where everyone always contributes a chip at the instigation of the alpha player, but the same player also always does most of the narration.  The game doesn't end until all the chips are spent.  I'm not sure what to do about people using their chips too quickly and getting bored, though.  Maybe you could have them play things on the GM's side when they ran out of chips, so that they wouldn't detract too much from the spotlight of the players who hadn't spent all their chips yet. [this approach would also let shy people sit back at the beginning and shine once they got a feel for the game]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115592/#Comment_115592" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T11:31:59+00:00" title="December 20, 2007 11:31AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Malcolm's idea.<br/><br/>His mention of the talking stick makes me actually want a talking stick.

This works well for teaching -- nobody knows who'll answer, so everybody pays attention. <br/><br/>But I really do think you need a rock-solid system that ensures that everybody gets the floor a certain amount of time; if that's how you play the game, then loud kids have the job of shutting up sometimes and the quiet kids have the job of speaking up sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115642/#Comment_115642" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T13:20:29+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  1:20PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chess clocks to limit spotlight time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115701/#Comment_115701" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T17:42:01+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  5:42PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's important to tie mechanics like this to a mechanical reward, otherwise it feels like work for no reward, or worse, paying to suck.<br/><br/>I like the "talking stick" idea, and I think it could be used to reinforce not just sharing spotlight, but also coming up with different solutions to problems.  <br/><br/>I propose the "action cup".  Every player has two or three "action dice" which they keep in front of them.  Every character has a special ability which is really useful for overcoming challenges.  In order to use your special ability, you have to be holding the "action cup", which can change hands once per scene.  When the cup changes hands, the new holder adds a dice to the cup.  When you use your special ability, you get to roll the dice in the cup.  You get some kind of bonus depending on how the dice roll.  The dice aren't used up, they just go back into the cup. When you hold the cup, you choose who to pass it to (or not to pass it).  <br/><br/>Or something like that.  The idea is that there's an incentive to get the cup to as many players as possible, and for them to use their ability.  Also, when you've got the cup, you've got a meaningful decision to make every scene.  It doesn't tie mechanical reward to big narrations or anything, which (in my opinion) is a terrible idea.  It rewards contribution and decision making, but it doesn't require anyone to do anything they're not comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115708/#Comment_115708" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T18:44:28+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  6:44PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it'd be neat if you could stop egg timers, or give out an equal number of tokens that symbolize a set time limit.  maybe the strength of playing cards equals the number of sentences you can say.  like a 5 is five sentences, and a queen is 10, or something?<br/>\nmaybe time also equals ability...or power of the action.  so i could spend alot of tokens thru out the game, to do little actions or i can spend a couple tokens for each action to perform "bigger" stunts.  <br/>\ni think you can only give people equal oppurtunity for describing.  forcing people who are less vocal to decribe story, i don't see that going so well.   <br/>\nyou have to make a non-verbal mechanic have as much game weight as vocalizing.<br/>\ni'm not sure how to do that.<br/>\nmaybe shy players can fuel the opposition?  like a player giving Gift Dice in tSoY to the Story Guide.<br/>\n...there are my jumbled-up thoughts                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115743/#Comment_115743" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T23:06:26+00:00" title="December 20, 2007 11:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time limits make shy players choke up.
