We had been playing and running multitudes of small press games and wanted to revisit the trad gaming structure. We played a year and a half of Pathfinder, and had a blast. mainly due to inter party fighting, great gm-ing, and trust. In that time the GM even won the 2011 Pathfinder All Star Competition (we take 150% of the credit of course, for inspiration).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, Sam moved away to law school and we contemplated the next game. We decided to tackle Changeling: the Lost... mainly because we we were curious about its victimization themes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter ~20 sessions and approximately 10 in-character days the game exploded. The characters were cool, but the pacing (partially my fault as GM), the rules, and the poor design of the game systems (the magic system was too botched to deal with) made the game unplayable to a few of the players. (the main rule book was edited by a comp [not on a comp, but by a computer] and it showed).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we were invested in both the characters and story, which promised vast awesome things (only 30 years of game time down the road). So we decided to have a end session using ...(much discussion)... Microscope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Tuesday we had microscope/changeling Session 1. It was crazy awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo summary of the timeline (we have one more session to go), but we have got to see amazing Events and Scenes that would have never been played out otherwise. However, we are not 100% sure how to close down the threads to bring the characters' story to any sort of conclusion. The desire to continue to open up story lines is very strong.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I would share, maybe some of the others will chime in.<br/>\n<br/>\n___<br/>\nJason                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354155/#Comment_354155" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T08:27:16+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  8:27AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2012 8:27AM by Mathalus.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should agree on when your last session will be.

OWoD was never exactly great shakes, but the higher target number and no more spending Willpower for autosuccesses just makes the game a constant whiff-fest, without even any learn-by-doing advancement a la BW or even freaking RuneQuest to take any of the sting away.

Were you just really unlucky or fighting people with super high Defenses, or...?<br><br>Maybe we were just unlucky, but I could not succeed at things for the life of me.  One success on a pool of 7-8 seemed surprisingly uncommon, especially since I had to spend Willpower to even get that many dice.  And when I did get a success, fairly often it was on a roll where margin of success mattered (like combat, or harvesting Glamour), so it was such a marginal success that I felt like I practically had failed.  After a certain point I started reading my pools ORE-style whenever I rolled to see if it'd be worth converting to Wild Talents or something.<br><br>And that's not even getting into rolls involving Defenses, unskilled penalties (so not only are we de facto penalized by having fewer dice to roll, we get double penalized for that crime by having more dice subtracted, with a chance of TRIPLE penalty depending on your choice of seeming), wound penalties (which synergizes terribly with the overall rarity of magical healing and the very long healing times), "too many cooks" penalties for multiple people gathering Glamour (so either everyone dogpiles and drives down everyone's harvest, or one person stocks up and the rest stay empty)... the game just seems outrageously stacked against starting characters.  I know this is kind of a trademark WoD thing, but, well, I got tired of earning my fun a long time ago and I guess you just can't go home again.\n<blockquote>I mean, nWoD's not perfect, but surely "whiff-fest" is a bad way to describe it.</blockquote>\nI don't know why no one seems to have these problems except our group, but I assure you that it sucked the fun right out of that game for me.  After a couple sessions I hated even touching the dice.  Looking back on it, I remember there were a few rolls I seemed to consistently manage (notably picking up stuff with the ba-rokenn Improvised Weapon Fighting Style merit), but my overall chances of success seemed inconsistent enough that whenever there was a roll I absolutely HAD to make, I failed it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rustin</cite>Tell me more.</blockquote>\nNot much to tell yet, but it seemed a natural given that one of CtL's central conflicts is reality vs illusion and unreliable perception and all that, and we had at least one character down to Clarity 3.  If we give it a shot next session I'll report back.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354174/#Comment_354174" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T11:42:18+00:00" title="January 13, 2012 11:42AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back when oWOD was new I ran a 2 year game of Vamp.

It doesn't bother me so much when it's a new setting and a new system and we're all learning the ropes together, but after you've played the game a little while, you just want to skip ahead and play characters who can do the cool stuff NOW instead of twenty sessions from now (when the game's probably about to end anyway).                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354194/#Comment_354194" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T17:44:26+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  5:44PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>One success on a pool of 7-8 seemed surprisingly uncommon, especially since I had to spend Willpower to even get that many dice.</blockquote>\nWith 7 dice you have a 70 percent probability of getting 2 successes and with 8 dice it's 76.  Pretty sure if you were routinely failing those it wasn't the system's fault.  <a href="http://wiki.white-wolf.com/worldofdarkness/index.php?title=Probability_Math" rel="nofollow">This site</a> has a breakdown of it.<br><br>An average combatant (2 dice in Attribute, 2 dice in combat skill - 2 Defense of an average opponent) can expect to inflict 1 damage about half the time, so yes, the combat system is not too deadly, it will have a lot of back and forth. However, supernatural stuff that just straight improves your Defense is pretty rare, so early combat skills tend to WAY outweight early Defenses.<br><br>As for Harvesting Glamour, 1-2 points of Glamour is supposed to be a pretty decent result, so yeah, if you needed more than that you were in trouble.<br><br>A lot of GMs (especially those who were active in the latter days of oWoD, when, um, the game creators forgot about this too) forget that marginal successes are still "you get most of what you're after" and 2 successes is complete success, so sometimes that is a problem.  If someone rolls 2 successes and a GM half gives them a halfhearted result, then it seems like 2 is a bad result, when actually it's a complete success.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354203/#Comment_354203" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T19:35:09+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  7:35PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: khelek</cite>Back when oWOD was new I ran a 2 year game of Vamp.

I can't argue with the math, but it doesn't retroactively made me have enjoyed the game more or failed rolls less.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354417/#Comment_354417" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T21:28:30+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  9:28PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Submitted for your approval: the player characters, the "Thrice-Sworn Motley," presented with only pre-microscope information.\n<ul>\n<li>David "Yahote Amada" Garcia. Approximately 30 years of age.<br/>A famous artist in multiple media with a particular penchant for performance art. He was captured by the True Fey during his most ambitious project: living homeless on the streets of DC. His durance made him one of the Fairest; a Muse I believe. His Mien is that of a shadowed figure outlined by the setting sun. In addition to creating art in the court of Nuata, I believe he was also the Fey lord's lover.<br/><br/>We dealt with his Fetch relatively early. It wandered into the Hedge and into our Hollow, was killed by the motley therein, and granted formless immortality in dreams when Yahote made a pledge with its departing spirit. Recently, he pledged to destroy the Autumn Court for a mysterious True Fey named Mordred. On a whim.</li>\n<li>Sean Kerrigan AKA "Kerrigan Tusk" AKA "Sean Sty". Approximately 47 years of age.<br/>A poet captured by the Fey in the 80s. His capacity for Poetry was ripped from him physically pulped into a book by a The Lady, a powerful True Fey and consort and ally to Nuata, known for taking exactly what she finds interesting from a mortal and largely discarding the rest. What remains is a Cyclopean Ogre whose official title was pig-keeper (he still wears the skin of a pig as a hood and cloak), but whose durance is infamous among Changelings for consisting of kidnapping mortals for the True Fey. Sean wants to atone for what he's done and carries a bag of deteriorating mementos from those he took. Children still recite a nursery rhyme to ward him off, and with reason: poetry spoken in Sean's presence repels him, as it can alert The Lady to his location immediately and draw her to him.<br/><br/>We were in the middle of discovering the tangled web woven by the Fetch inhabiting Sean's life when the campaign switched to Microscope-mode. His wife is cheating on his Fetch with another supernatural creature of some kind, his daughter is very well versed in the ways of Changelings, and his Fetch knowingly allows other Changelings to feed on the Glamour generated at his poetry readings.<br/><br/>Recently, he inadvertently went on a rampage through dozens of dreams, and is wracked with new guilt.</li>\n<li>Maya. Approximately 18 years of age.<br/>A Wizenend Soldier, Maya's durance did not consist of the horrors of war, but rather of bizarre, dream-like, ritualized duels reminiscent of the symbol-filled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena" rel="nofollow">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>.<br/><br/>Maya's time in durance was the shortest of our crew: her face is still on milk cartons and her Mien is hardly different from her Mask. Maya is a youthful mirror to the rest of the cast. While Yahote has slick detachment, Maya is genuine and honest; Sean is paralyzed with remorse, but Maya is curious and experimental; Tommy is haunted by the horrors he's seen, but Maya remains innocent and brash; Alexandra is absolutely confident in her convictions, Maya retains a healthy amount of skepticism and insecurity. She's started crafting her own Hedgespun armaments and is scheduled to duel a member of the Summer Court. Recently, she invoked the power of her recently constructed Token without knowing what it did, resulting in a very public display of magic at a poetry reading, causing Sean's fetch to reveal his dealings with Changelings by scolding us.</li>\n<li>Alexandra Cassiopeia Lee, played by me. Approximately 25 years of age.<br/>Socialite and scion of the famous Lee family of Virginia and Maryland (Richard Henry Lee, Francis "Lightfoot" Lee, Robert E. Lee, Jackie Kennedy Onassis' mom [this was a lie in the real world, but perhaps not in our Changeling game]). In non-microscope play, it was recently revealed that she and her little sister Christine Ariadne were sold into durance by their father, a senator, in exchange for access to a potent site in Arcadia. This act seems to have identified senator Lee as a Mage. Alexandra believes her younger sister to have died in Durance.<br/><br/>Alexandra is a Mirrorskin Darkling, a shapechanger who can assume the form of anyone she's met. She has a second Kith as well, Flowering, which makes her scent alluring and intoxicating. Nuata used her to impersonate the True Fey, including himself when he did not have the time or inclination to deal with The Lady. Upon returning from Arcadia, she resolved never to acknowledge herself as a victim and instead to extract bloody revenge on all of Arcadia for herself and for all Changelings. She plotted to turn the powerful engine of America's so-called "culture of fear" against the True Fey and started by releasing murderous rat-like Hobs in the District of Columbia, unsupervised, to start seeding the body of evidence needed to prove that a supernatural threat to national security exists. She has extensive Allies within both the Federal Government and terrorist organizations and is making in-roads with the US military. She's accepted the title of Baron from the Spring Court.<br/><br/>Recently, she made a Pledge with Yahote regarding her fetch, who's she's met in a dream and inspired with words of self-determination and acts of self-sacrifice. Yahote is to make her Fetch a Hero, on penalty of death. Whether Alexandra is trying to maintain some kind of karmic balance for the evil she'll have to commit to destroy Arcadia or if there's a large plan involved remains to be seen.</li>\n<li>Tommy Achilles AKA "The Greek". Approximately 32 years of age.<br/>A Veterinarian captured into durance to serve in Nuata and The Lady's horrific war-games in Arcadia as a medic, leaving him a Wizened Chirugeon with almost classic PTSD symptoms. His first goal was to secure shelter, and he took on the monumental task of cat-herding to get his Pledge-mates into our Hollow, an abandoned hunting lodge that once belonged to Nuata but made wholly ours by the power of our Thrice-Sworn Oath, our Motley pledge.<br/><br/>Tommy has no interest in resuming his former life, but he does want a new normal mortal identity and a place to live outside of the hollow. Tommy was the first to master the art of Pledge-making with mortals, the first to realize how incredibly dangerous Alexandra could be.<br/><br/>I thought he was our pillar of sanity and grounded reality, but recently he became the first to embrace Alexandra's aggressive plan of revenge against Arcadia. This new imbalance in the social dynamics of Motley may have led to Maya getting servants of her own to swear Fealty to her and to Yahote's further descent into madness.</li></ul>\nNext time: how we chose the first and last periods in Microscope!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354422/#Comment_354422" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T22:13:38+00:00" title="January 15, 2012 10:13PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very badass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354480/#Comment_354480" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T11:19:28+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 11:19AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I wanna play that game too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354702/#Comment_354702" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T11:05:55+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 11:05AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks! <br/>I should mention that Joe McGuffin plays Tommy Achilles and Buddha Rules (I think that's his storygames handle.

Around halfway through I was worried we were digressing too much and not going to get enough closure to put the outstanding plot threads to bed, but George pointed out that the wording on a late-timeline Event we'd laid down two weeks ago dovetailed perfectly with some of the stuff we'd just played out in Scenes, which is the kind of thing that keeps me coming back to Microscope.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was an interesting experience.  I'd never played a game of Microscope for more than one sitting, and while I've often idly thought about using it to sketch out a setting &amp; history for use in a more character-centric game, I never even considered doing it the other way around.  I think it turned out really well.  While some of the plot turns probably wouldn't have turned out that way in a linearly played, character-advocacy campaign, I really enjoyed getting to mess around with ideas that flat-out would not have been feasible until another 500 XP or so.<br/><br/>This was also probably the largest game of Microscope I've been in; with six players and a fairly large amount of Scenes, it took us three sessions of 3-4 hours apiece to give everyone at the table a chance at being the Lens.  Whew!<br/><br/>For a complete change of pace, our next game is probably going to be Earthdawn or Ars Magica, though after trying out a test combat in ED we're leaning a bit more towards Ars...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
