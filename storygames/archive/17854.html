Another part of that thing - if i understand this correctly - is making an artistic <br/>choice which involves scarcity and constraint to the game design process. <br/><br/>The entire time he's been talking about it he's been talking about the one-physical-sheet aspect. <br/>I'd be willing to bet that, without that extremely fruitful (to him, and to me as well) constraint in place, <br/>this project wouldn't have gained the momentum to actually get off of the ground.<br/>That would mean $0 raised for the American Diabetes Association, the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center, <br/>the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, the Against Malaria Foundation, and for the classrooms of Donors Choose. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I like artistic constraints. There will be at least two games in the collection which benefit from being on paper <br/>instead of on screen - Filamena's and mine. Robert was talking about doing something that takes the medium <br/>itself into account, too. Sure, you could read these games on a screen, and you could even play Filamena's via <br/>a tablet, i guess - but i don't know if you'd want to treat your tablet that way. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Now that there's some voices asking for PDF, I'm sure A Terrible Idea will consider it. And maybe that <br/>period of consideration will end up with him sticking to his original plan, and not offering the collection <br/>in any digital format. In any case, that would be a choice that he makes for the second Octo collection - <br/>this one's contract is well in place.<br/><br/>I've agreed to make a game that occupies a single sheet of paper, and have exactly 216 copies of that game <br/>distributed to those who donate to a set group of charities. Through making a donation, you receive a <br/>physical copy of the collection - this doesn't come with any permissions to modify or redistribute that collection or <br/>pieces thereof. <br/><br/>I'm not talking about legal issues per se. I'm talking about the intent of an artist through and towards their work, <br/>and also about the entitlement that some consumers of that art may feel towards it. Now, I don't come down <br/>hard on either side of this - but i feel that it's a conversation worth having. Sure, re-distributing it to some friends <br/>may get the game played more, and it may even raise more money for those charities that are benefited by Octo. <br/>Those are both good things. It might also result in neither of those things. <br/><br/>What it has definitely resulted in, however, is someone taking control of a situation in which no control was offered. <br/>I think it's worth noting when this happens in one's life - when others do this to you, when you do this to others.<br/>Is your will really the more valuable, more important? Do you understand what they were doing there, before you <br/>changed it? And sometimes the answer will be "Yes, and that's why I changed it."<br/><br/>For goodness sakes, though, I hope this isn't one of those situations. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I expect my game for Octo will be available in a collection of my own works in the coming years. <br/>This isn't the only time you or your friends will have access to it. <br/><br/><br/>Thanks for reading.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404062/#Comment_404062" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T15:42:01+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  3:42PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jackson, thank you for writing such a thoughtful and articulate piece; I'm hard pressed to add anything of value other to say that I am very excited by the medium and distribution format and am greatly looking forward to reading the games in this collection!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404064/#Comment_404064" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T15:49:37+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  3:49PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1,000,000                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404068/#Comment_404068" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T16:12:30+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  4:12PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a firm believer in artistic expression, even if that expression crashes head-on with my distain for artificial scarcity of infomation in a digital age.  <br/><br/>Having said that...

To deliberately turn away from that, to deliberately cap the amount of funds this project can create for charity, just rubs me the wrong way.  Drive Thru RPG has shown what the power of going full digital can do for charity.  If you're going to turn away from PDFs, why even post about it on social media?  Just mimeograph that bad boy and sell it door to door or at conventions.  Either go full Luddite or embrace what the 21st century can do for your cause.

I like to push the envelope with graphical design, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse...but every choice is a deliberate artistic decision. <br/><br/>This has rendered a number of my PDFs "non-printer-friendly", and I've had a few people ask for "printer-friendly" versions of the products. These people have often made the comment that they'd love to play the games but they would find it easier with a printed copy, and that they'd love to print the game but it's too "ink-intensive" or some other similar comment. <br/><br/>I've seriously wondered whether to compromise my artistic integrity to make a more mainstream version of the products, something that might be more marketable or more user friendly. If I were in it for the money, this might be an easy decision...create a version where I just throw away the fancy formatting, leaving text and a few images. But I'm designing the stuff that I'd want to play, and I find most products not to be very visually stimulating...<i>"oh, another digest sized book", "ooh look, another Letter sized book in two column format with a standard 11pt font"</i>. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that standard formats are bad, they're great for comprehension and that why they've become standards. I'm saying that something a bit different stands out, and I respect an artist who stands by their artistic principles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404072/#Comment_404072" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T17:21:18+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  5:21PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would anybody be angry about this?

I love the Wayne Foundation charity bundle and was raring to go on this one. But my personal preference for digital copies kicked in. I know my preference for pdfs and the like comes from a very personal place of being forced to move around a lot in the last 8 years to the point that I had to throw out/sell a lot of books and DVDs. In the last year I discovered places like DriveThru and they are actually a major comfort to my own personal neuroses of losing things I love. Digital has made it so that no matter where I go I never have to say goodbye to any of the amazing games I buy off of there. I've ended up getting to the point where if I don't see a digital option I usually pass on purchasing. I do hope you raise a lot for charity and I would not hesitate in the slightest to snatch up any future pdf offerings.<br/><br/>Also, I love/hate Jackson Tegu. I never read any of his games but dammit if the description of Silver and White isn't making me want it bad. But then my hesitancy to buy an analog game kicks in. It sounds completely silly, but I have struggled a lot about certain games that go straight analog. I still haven't gotten the point where I can purchase them, but Tegu's stuff is definitely pushing me towards that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404075/#Comment_404075" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T18:02:40+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  6:02PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Having said that...

There's a creator saying "I've got a thing that I want to create and hand to others. How do I want to do that?" Indie publication has no template, only a bunch of interesting endeavors that overlap and inform one another.<br/><br/>This endeavor doesn't make it harder to pursue digital distribution in the future. Contrary, it adds new information to the table for creators who're considering publication. It says, <i>hey, this is another thing you could do, and this is how well that worked for us.</i><br/><br/>I get your thing about artificial scarcity.<br/>I'd like to offer that it's also silly to impose an artificial scarcity of distribution models.<br/><br/>We've got lots of different models for publishing - we should use them, let them play against each other, let them inform each other, let them be distinct, let their contrasting emergent properties surprise us, and keep innovating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dylanix" title="dylanix"><img alt="dylanix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nPR7I305WK1I4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dylanix">dylanix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404076/#Comment_404076" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T18:04:43+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  6:04PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frankly, the print-only choice was a large part of what snagged my support for the project. It feels intimate, like there's this stronger sense of sharing what was made. That complements the charity-driven component very well in my mind.  If this doesn't do anything for you, then it's not for you. It's not a bad idea; it's just a different approach that doesn't line up with how you would have done it.<br/><br/>My personal preference for printed things applies here, too, I suppose.  I'm less likely to forget about the physical objects I possess because I only have so much room for them. Especially for games, this means I'll use what I have or give away to those who might want it when I don't any longer. I've gone way overboard with digital distribution platforms in the past, and I'm trying to keep a watch on my media consumption.<br/><br/>I enjoy the convenience of digital, and if I can pair the two I'll certainly go in for that. huckabees, I'm right with you on the pangs of letting go of the things we own; I certainly don't discredit your feelings there, since I have similar struggles.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404077/#Comment_404077" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T18:51:51+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  6:51PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, I love/hate Jackson Tegu.

I don't want to condemn or condone any specific actions - as someone who's associated with Octo but by no means its spokesperson (and nor the spokesperson for 7 of the 8 games), I'm in an interesting position where my personal stance could be taken as the official Octo line, so i'd rather not say anything on the subject. But I'm glad you're chewing it over in public.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Temptation is an interesting thing. When there's even 15 minutes of work between you copying someone a thing, maybe you'll not get around to that 15 minutes. Or at least, while engaged in the work, you may waffle as to whether you want to be doing it after all. But when it's already on your harddrive - or sitting on your gmail - and a friend asks after it - and it's only 15 seconds of work to send it off to them... it can be very tempting. When things become easy, they're sometimes not so well examined. <br/><br/>It's interesting thinking about this in "disease outbreak" terms. Like, how far would that PDF travel? Once you let that monkey out of the research facility...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>huckabees &amp; Joe Mcdaldno (hello again!):<br/><br/>Well, I'm totally a fan of paper, it's true. My preference leads me to not so much take a stance on the divide, but to prioritize the work that produces paper over the work that produces PDF. For example, my recent game collections are paper-exclusive due to the way they're laid out to print &amp; cut - trying to read the printing PDF onscreen would be a twisty puzzle (there are 8 non-sequential pages per printed sheet). To get the PDF ready would take another dive into the project, and my attention is, regrettably, elsewhere.<br/><br/>The thing i'm working on right now was, until last week, going to be PDF-exclusive. Ross Cowman, designer of Serpent's Tooth (etc), who has shown me the light surrounding PDF printing for Silver And White, has also convinced me to offer a physical copy of the Monsterhearts Second Skins. So... i fall off of both sides.<br/><br/>And yes, there was a time when i printed &amp; mailed people physical playtest copies of Silver And White. I didn't want them to just read them, i wanted it played &amp; thought that would add a little weight to the playtest request - but they've predominantly been PDFs throughout the history of the piece. When it's finalized, both paper and PDF will be available. <br/><br/>But there are lots of other reasons to have internal tension about both loving &amp; hating me, so don't let that go!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404264/#Comment_404264" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-22T11:09:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2013 11:09AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But there are lots of other reasons to have internal tension about both loving &amp; hating me, so don't let that go! </blockquote>\nIf you need a new reason to both love and hate Jackson, here's one: he can make any haircut look amazing.

This isn't a venue I frequent, but I thought I'd chime in if for no other reason than to free Jackson up from awkward position being the guy speaking on behalf of the project itself while being a contributor.  I'm happy to share what I was thinking when deciding not to do a digital release.<br/><br/>There were a few different things that went into this.  One is a series of conversations I was having with another game designer about the idea of doing an analog only gaming zine, and if there was room for such a thing.  We didn't know, I still don't know.  But postulating about that contributed to this some.<br/><br/>Another contributing factor for me was the relationship I wanted to have with the contributors.  I want to pay them reasonably for the work, while allowing them to retain control over their content to allow them to decide how, when, if and in what medium to distribute it outside of Octo.  The agreement I've made with all the contributors is that I get to print a fixed number of copies for Octo, and I've asked them not to distribute digitally until the beginning of July, which should end up being about 3 months after Games Of Spring is in the mail.  I've also indicated I don't intend to enforce or police that - it's an ask.  These are their games, not mine, and what the authors do with them outside of Octo is entirely their decision - they can upload them, sell them, creative commons them, offer their own charity bundle, or keep them in a vault.  It was important to me that I pay for the work, but it wasn't practical for me to buy digital distribution rights, at least not in a way I felt was fair to the contributors.<br/><br/>Octo is meant to be a thing.  Things persist differently from data.  Not better or worse, just differently.  I'd wager we all have character sheets with smudges and stains and tears on them that represent stories we'd likely have forgotten if they persisted as data.  I'd also wager there's one we'd really like to have a scan of that we can't find anymore.  It's not a question to me of better or worse.  I wanted Octo to be a thing, with smudges and imperfections misaligned bits, possibly something a friend will spill coffee on.<br/><br/>There's a hypothesis here: that an analog only collection like this will be interesting enough that 200 people will give to charity to get it.  The only way to test that hypothesis is to run an experiment, which is what this is.  It might not yield the results I'm hoping for, but either way it'll teach me something I didn't know.  Even if I kick myself in the face in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404348/#Comment_404348" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T18:46:50+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  6:46PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why didn't you advertise this thing for what it is, instead of what it's not?<br/>I Can't Believe It's Not Butter = This Margarine Shit Is Awesome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404352/#Comment_404352" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-23T20:19:51+00:00" title="January 23, 2013  8:19PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting that explaination, ATerribleIdea.
