During it, I figured out why I'd rather do almost anything else than play a board game.<br/><br/>The panel was meant to discuss what makes a good game, and what one wants out of games. (The language in the title is purposefully overblown.) During the conversation we asked whether games can be good or bad (we determined they could be), what made a game good or bad (it does or does not meet its objectives), and what you want out of games.<br/><br/>My answer: I like to be creative with my friends. And a light went on over my head. No matter how good a board game is, it's not a creative activity. This is not to say that board games are for stupid people or that they don't take brains or strategic and tactical thinking, but they're non-creative. Even if I enjoy playing a board game, afterwards I find myself wishing I'd been creative with these people. If they're not into roleplaying games, then I find myself wishing I'd spent that time talking to them.<br/><br/>This was a satisfying realization for me. All of my gamer friends like playing board games and the most I ever say is "Ok, I'll do that with you because I like you and you like that." I was wondering why I was so weird. Why these people who I loved loved doing something that always made me feel quite "meh."<br/><br/>Now I know.

I don't drink, but that's an easy one to dismiss: it's being social, and that's fine. As for movies?<br/><br/>I'm not sure. Maybe I see it as grist for future discussions? I know when I see a movie with friends, I want to do so because I want to share my effusive enthusiasm for something with other people.

Where does the creativity come in?<br/><br/>It's a Wild West card game where take on the roll of the Sheriff or an Outlaw.  The creativity comes in through roleplaying shooting at people and the game encouraging you to be over the top.  When we pass dynamite around the table we feign throwing a stick through the air, it can be a riot.<br/><br/>I also edited in Battlestar Galactica the Boardgame to my original post (BSG).  Another game which encourages creativity through adopting to specific roles and requiring interesting social dynamics with the other players.<br/><br/>Games like Catch Phrase/Taboo require a bit of creativity as well.

Like I said, just having a conversation is preferable to board games to me.<br/><br/>Maybe it's:<br/><br/>* Board games eat up a lot of social space.<br/>* They're non-creative.<br/>* I don't love them with the burning intensity that I do movies and concerts, where I can overlook the lack of creative outlet despite the monopolizing of the social space.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The thing is I'm not trying to draw proscriptive lines for anyone. I know that I don't enjoy board games, and I'm trying to figure out why. The missing creativity piece is the best answer I can think of for my own very-real feelings on the matter.<br/><br/>It's like, I have empirical data about my own reaction to playing board games. I'm trying to figure out why.

You have all of the "topic of conversation" stuff that's good about a movie for after the game, only you also get to talk to your friends DURING the game.<br/><br/>- Strategy is creativity, it's just not narrative creativity: it's totally fun to see the way my friends' minds work managing resources, deciding courses of action, plotting future moves. It's a really satisfying and fascinating thing to go brain-to-brain against a friend that way. I guess I just take umbrage at your assertion that telling a story together is the only kind of creativity there is. I've played board games that required a resourcefulness and flexibility of thought that are unmatched in a lot of the usual RPG subjects.<br/><br/>- No worries about creative agenda: everyone who gets together to play a board game is getting together to play the same game. There are occasional drifts in rules (We don't use the river in Carcasonne, you're allowed to swap out a blank tile on the board with the letter in Scrabble) which are easy to explain, easy to justify, and most importantly-- are obvious and clear and people are self-aware enough to point out the change. Whenever I sit down to play an RPG with new folks, I'm apprehensive about whether our play styles will mesh, even if I'm good friends with the people. I never have to worry about that with friends and board games; at most I just have to worry about whether I like the same kinds of games my friends do.<br/><br/><br/>I don't know. I love RPGs, and I love board games, and I'm certainly not saying that one is superior to the other. I do certainly feel that one is not inherently INferior to the other. I mean, hell, I write RPGs.. but the most fun GAME I've played in the last year was Settlers of Cattan on my birthday. Everyone was loud and laughing and having fun, making crazy alliances and cursing the dice, having bidding wars based on machismo and not strategy.  If I could get that PLUS story out of every RPG I played, I'd never pick up a board game again-- but I can't.<br/><br/>(Enter the board-game RPG hybrids like Transantiago, It's Complicated, and Time and Temp here.)<br/><br/>Edit: crossposted with Rob and Bret above. I'm baffled by your constant and consistant use of the phrase "non-creative" here, Rob. Have you ever tried thinking creatively in the process of playing a board game?

That's emphatically not what this is about. It's about me trying to figure out why I don't enjoy board games. Why I'd rather do almost anything else with my friends than play board games.<br/><br/>Elizabeth: I think we have different definitions of what the word "creativity" means. I don't see strategic thinking as creativity. This is not to put a value judgment on the words "creativity" or "strategy," though.<br/><br/>Robert: That's certainly an element of it, I'm sure. I'm not a big one for constant competition when interacting with my friends. However, a little competition in RPGs doesn't bother me that much, and I've had very similar feelings about non-competitive board games. So yeah, it's a piece, but it's not the whole pie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226700/#Comment_226700" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T09:28:48+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  9:28AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It makes sense to me that you're focused on your relative enjoyment of RPGs and BGs.

Movies, TV, concerts are about observing rather than doing; cooking or other domestic projects have a point other than just fun; sports and dancing usually take place outside the home (or local game shop); eating, drinking and/or talking usually doesn't have a pre-set agenda of what's going to be done, and can be grafted on to the game niche easily enough.  Group playing of videogames is in the same category.<br/><br/>There's a few other things that share the niche, but these days people usually don't get together with friends for impromptu sing-alongs or play readings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amoeba" title="amoeba"><img alt="amoeba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amoeba">amoeba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226702/#Comment_226702" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T09:32:45+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  9:32AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the definition of a game, and does it even involve "creativity"?<br/>\nPerhaps RPGs/Story Games aren't even truly "games" in the original sense, but rather a form of art?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226703/#Comment_226703" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T09:34:30+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  9:34AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 9:36AM by Graham.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, do you like any social games that are non-creative?

Some of the most deeply creative experiences of my life have come while playing competitive games. Tournaments in particular. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>- No worries about creative agenda: everyone who gets together to play a board game is getting together to play the same game. There are occasional drifts in rules (We don't use the river in Carcasonne, you're allowed to swap out a blank tile on the board with the letter in Scrabble) which are easy to explain, easy to justify, and most importantly-- are obvious and clear and people are self-aware enough to point out the change. Whenever I sit down to play an RPG with new folks, I'm apprehensive about whether our play styles will mesh, even if I'm good friends with the people. I never have to worry about that with friends and board games; at most I just have to worry about whether I like the same kinds of games my friends do..</blockquote>\nOh, god yes.

Something about working with someone mitigated for me the ugly feelings I got when I was competing with my friends. I think I don't like competitive games not because I'm not an inherently competitive person, but because I am very competitive and I don't like the guy I become when I get that way.

Maybe some other social activity you would have come out knowing your friends better / having bonded more / other.  When you role play you come out with a narrative story as a intangible "object" that you can share or treasure yourself in the future.

I've been touching on this subject off and on for a while now. I have some friends who are boardgamers of the first degree, who are theorists on Boardgamegeek.com, and it's interesting to talk about RPGs from their perspective. An interesting quote from one of them, which I'll have to paraphrase:<br/>\n<br/>\n"I've never played any RPG that wasn't horribly broken as a game." <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll get back to that. <br/>\n<br/>\nRob, I'm probably being a bit didactic, but I think you should have used some other term than creativity. I think I can feel what you mean, but obviously some folks feel that boardgaming is a creative activity. I'm one of them. And, to channel Ron for a moment, I think you're just talking about "Creative Agenda" here. "Narrative" as an output is, to me, too simple. That is, narrative might be what you're looking for, but RPGs provide other outputs that board games do not. For example that product of "simulationism" play, where you feel that the world of has some sort of tangibility to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might not be anything you're looking for, but I don't think you've ruled it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, Ralph's question gets to the crux of things. Is it really the narrative as an output that you're cherishing after the fact? Do you really remember those things well? I rarely recall details of play well after a while (no moreso than I can tell you what I did last Monday). From that POV, the term "Creativity" is perfectly accurate. What I think you miss, whatever the specific of the agenda is, is the ACT of creating the sort of thing that you want to create. Who cares about output, was it fun while actually playing? It's the act, not the result, that I think matters. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs the "meta-agenda" if you will, what separates RPGs from boardgames is what Ron calls Exploration. I've tried to define what this is in very concrete terms, and it's not easy. Where does revealing the board in a boardgame with a hidden set up differ from having your character wander around and discover things in a RPG? For instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's my one theory that I think sorta has some credibility to it: in a RPG, the question of what is over the next hill has a potentially infinite number of answers. Even if we limit things by genre, or other limitations, that simply makes it a smaller infinity. In a boardgame, there's only so many things that could be over the hill. If you've played the game, in fact, you probably have a pretty good idea of the range of possibilities. In being like the real world, in being potentially infinite, RPGs have a quality that is much more like real life. And, so in exploring, no matter how you explore, or what agenda, you feel like you're not simply in a tiny sandbox, but in a realm that is as large as the real world. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that, to me, makes a big difference somehow. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to Bill, and RPGs being broken. Given the infinite number of potential things that can happen in a RPG, mechanically there's always some point at which the judgment of one or more participants comes into play. Usually the GM. Deciding something like "should we bother to roll." <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you imagine in Monopoly having players say, "Eh, don't bother rolling to see where you land, just head to GO." <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it is this fact, and factors that extend from it, that make the boardgamers feel that all RPGs are completely imperfect playing fields. I mean Bill is a guy who also says that having any random element in a boardgame makes it worse design. Because it becomes in some small way less of a clear test of your abilities to manipulate the game better than your opponent. Consider that perspective for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is, unfortunately, quite possible that the two viewpoints are irreconcilable. How can you have an infinity of possibilities, and yet no judgment involved in deciding how to adjudicate the outcome? How can you write rules to cover everything? As Bill puts it... what do you do when your opponent in the arena decides to throw sand in your face? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I'm kinda with Morningstar in how I don't like games to be competitive in the sense of having to hate your opponent to win. OK, that's an overstatement, but I'm referencing the movie "Searching For Bobby Fischer" (which, if you haven't seen it, you must as it is key to all of this I think). There are two quite distinct "gamist" agendas involved there. I tell people that I don't play to win so much as to explore creative strategies when I play. And that seems somewhat valid. But, know what? <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm just scared of losing when trying hard to win. And have created an agenda that does not allow me to lose.

If you like you can term it "agenda" rather than "creative agenda", but one very common way of playing board games is the celebration of everyone choosing their moves to maximize their probability of winning the game. When some people are doing that and others are just throwing in a little bit of what to them feels like competition (this is how I think of what many in this thread say they like from a board game), it often works okay, but you get things that look exactly like creative agenda clashes. Kingmaking. "He always wins!". Taking competition "too seriously". AFAICT these are all symptoms of getting different things from play. Riding bikes for the camaraderie with an occasional "race you to the tree!" is a wholly different activity than a bike race.<br/><br/>I've never played, read, or heard of an RPG that wasn't horribly broken as a game where the players are celebrating everyone choosing their moves to maximize their probability of winning the game. I doubt it's possible, and that's fine, as long as everyone's aware of the agenda differences.<br/><br/>There's another bit to separate out here, I think... there's everyone choosing their moves to maximize their probability of winning the game, there's <i>not</i> doing that, there's <i>feeling</i> competitive and <i>not</i> feeling competitive, and there's taking winning/losing seriously and not. These are three separate axes. Absolutely separate. When playing a board game my favorite mode is maximize probability, feel competitive, don't take winning seriously. Poker? Maximize probability, don't feel competitive, take winning seriously. D&amp;D4e's combat encounters? Don't maximize probability, feel competitive, take winning seriously. Burning Wheel's Fight!? Don't maximize probability, don't feel competitive, don't take winning seriously.<br/><br/>I've met people who I feel like have never experienced one side or the other of every one of these axes (except the not-maximizing-probability-of-winning one).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226783/#Comment_226783" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T12:34:25+00:00" title="August 22, 2009 12:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 12:35PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Mike: I think it's quite possible that people read judgment into my calling the playing of boardgames to be a non-creative act.

But that's some damned loaded language you're engaging in by not adding the "for you/me" part.  I mean, I read the implicit "for you/me", but a straight-up read says you're criticizing someone else's fun. Even if you don't mean to be.<br/><br/>So, I play quite a bit of chess. I love chess.

Long ago, I realized what I like about chess is that the way I was brought up to play it is metaphor for conversation. And that's colored many of my competitive games over the years. What I like these days is playing with people who will then happily discuss after the game where it went in different directions and the like -- thus the game becomes context for fascinating conversation.

I too have drifted further and further away from competitive games, but I still love Pandemic and Lord of the Rings or Shadows. Yes, I can only play competitive games with those that don't take it seriously and well, that means I don't play a lot of competitive games. I cannot stand it when players are gleeful (I've seen 40-year old guys hop up and down with childish glee) when they score points or beat someone else or worse, deliberately screw someone else and so upset when it happens to them. Ugh. As Jason says, it ruins the winning or the losing.<br/><br/>A lot of boardgames seem to be about racking up points via some metaphor while barely interacting with the other players and in that case, I'd rather play solitare. It's hard enough these days with everyone's adult lives to get a bunch of people together that I'd rather do some group activity that's social than an activity that's just doing something by yourself near other people doing the same thing.<br/><br/>[edited to fix the citation]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226789/#Comment_226789" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T13:15:19+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  1:15PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone can relax a bit, we know Robert's not a dick and he's not trying to criticize other people's fun. Sometimes I feel like words said by a friend in conversation would be granted all kinds of context and leeway, but words read on screen are suddenly taken only at face value. Benefit of the doubt people.<br/><br/>I'm totally with you Robert, but the biggest disadvantage of boardgames for me is the lack of Story. I love stories, whether creating them (RPGs), watching them (movies), or reading them. Stories seem to give reason and value to what's happening on the table or on the screen. <br/><br/>Just as I won't watch a kickboxing championship on DVD, I also don't play the Street Fighter video games or pretty much any collectible card games. To me these are all just fight after fight with no context, no drama, and often no reason to be there outside the entertainment of the battles themselves. This doesn't mean I have something against fighting though. I'll watch 300 or play Mass Effect all day long, but that's because these tell a story in my mind.<br/><br/>RPGs are my favorite way to tell or watch an unfolding story so they are naturally preferable to boardgames. That being said, Betrayal at House on the Hill (and to a lesser extent Arkham Horror) is a fantastic boardgame that succeeds in telling a story better than any other boardgame I've seen.<br/><br/>The second reason I dislike boardgames is because 95% of them are competitive. I'm not a competitive dude and I hate the idea that my fun or my win must come at the expense of someone else's. This level of competition rarely, if ever, enters the RPGs I play and makes them preferable to boardgames yet again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226793/#Comment_226793" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T13:30:55+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  1:30PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, is it perhaps a lack of investment on your part, rather than a lack of creativity in the activity?<br/><br/>When I strategize in an rpg, I like it because I'm invested in a story and in characters.<br/><br/>When I strategize in a board/card game (a strategy game!), it just seems like an intellectual exercise, because I'm not invested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226798/#Comment_226798" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T13:53:24+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  1:53PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jarvis: I was just thinking about how to deal with the semantic clusterfuck the thread has flirted with becoming, and decided to say something much like what you did. <br/><br/>Empirical fact: Whenever I consider or finish playing a board game, I think of the things I could have done with those people instead that I would have liked better.<br/><br/>Hypothesis: If I'm going to be in a social environment, I'd prefer to talk with them or create or share art with them.

About twenty-five players of D&amp;D or WoD of various editions, all kind of awkwardly making idle chit-chat. Most didn't know each other, as the point of the gathering was to allow different players to meet each other.<br/><br/>I decided to bring a couple games (and I turned out to be the only one who brought any). I brought <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6411" rel="nofollow">Rumis</a> because it's a four-player puzzle game with colorful pieces that are fun to watch carefully being placed together. I brought <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16992" rel="nofollow">Tsuro</a> because it's a very simple game for up to eight players that is highly competitive, but very short so the sting of a loss doesn't linger very long. Neither of these produce any kind of fiction.<br/><br/>Rumis got played a bit, but Tsuro was the big hit of the gathering. Eight people gathered around the board and a handful more watched from the sidelines. Total strangers were high-fiving each other, laughing, smack-talking and generally having a grand ol' time.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the party, I was talking to the host who was pleased that the mixer was such a success and that he hoped some new D&amp;D groups would form out of the occasion. However, he made a passing comment about Tsuro being nice, but he wanted to get some real games going after this party.<br/><br/>I wish I could remember his exact words, but it just seemed odd to me to be so dismissive of something that produced tons of uproarious fun in ten minutes between strangers when it would've taken far longer with a traditional RPG. Isn't there room for both in the fun-o-sphere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226809/#Comment_226809" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T15:21:37+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  3:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At some point earlier this year I realized that playing badminton made me feel almost exactly the same way as a really, really good rpg experience. The difference being: a good badminton session is, at least for me, much, much easier to achieve. Plus it makes me sleep better and shrinks my belly.<br/><br/>It is not the physical activity in itself that makes me feel so good about badminton (Even if that helps, I like running too because of the physical aspect. But running lacks the other qualities) it is that it forces me to take tactical decisions in a fraction of a second plus the excitement in not knowing how your opponent will answer to your last shot. It was an epiphany for when I realized that this, at least on a psycological level was the same for me as a successful group improv without hesitation. In the moment each point in the game is like collaborative fantasy. (I could have used squash as an example instead, but I have more fun badmintone opponents these days)<br/><br/>(Reality check: Can anyone identify with this?)<br/><br/>I think theoretically I could enjoy boardgames in the same way, (I do truly enjoy some boardgames, I carry a large Eufrat and Tigris infatuation, for example) but often the stress of intellectual achievement and trying to best your opponents during the boardgame make me sad. Of course, Eufrat and Tigris should be enough to make anyone happy anytime, but that's a rare gem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Why I don't like board games - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10209/why-i-dont-like-board-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Why I don't like board games - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10209/why-i-dont-like-board-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Daniel, this is exactly it.

Absolutely, check. Environments? For everything but the most abstract Euros, and even then they pay lip service to them? Check. Characters?

Poker, for example. It contains individualized contextualized Scenes (each hand), conflict (take the hand), and meaningful choices everywhere. And if you don't think there's narrative, I dare you to talk to enthusiastic poker players after a game. Their rendition of the back-and-forths along with the table-talk comes out as gripping as the most hardcore of the Forgites' or Story-Gamers' discussion of their characters' successes and failures and how it might fit into a narrative. The conflicts have a different complexion, but the <em>story</em> part of them are very, very similar. (And before you say "the cards are the content while <em>my</em> stories are about human drama!" recognize the poker player without an investment in your character would likely say "well, their content is all about rolling some piddly dice combinations;" you miss the story by focusing on the expression.)</p>\n<p>Rob, I think you may have really shot yourself right in the foot by suggesting boardgames are "non-creative," no matter how you meant it. I can absolutely buy that they're not artifactually creative; that is, the aim is not in and of itself to create a narrative. Narrative falls out as a result of experiencing and retelling, and many board games are pretty much the apotheosis of the SG implicit maxim "the mechanics should all serve to create the experience." Creative play in boardgames are exactly how one succeeds in them; that's the point.</p>\n<p>(Games like <em>Capes</em> and <em>Shock</em> have successfully decoupled the idea of "singular protagonist play" as the only or even best way to have even solid RPG stories, and that used to be one of the biggest RPG-vs-boardgame hammers to swing. And I don't even know where to start when we edge over into <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/az3/twohourwargames/" rel="nofollow">solo and same-side-friendly wargame/RPG hybrids like the games Two Hour Wargames put out</a> or boardgames like <a href="http://www.flyingfrog.net/lastnightonearth/" rel="nofollow"><em>Last Night on Earth</em></a> which feature strongly defined protagonist roles for players vs a zombie/antagonist-controlling GM. Where do those fit into the "boardgames are non-creative" architecture?</p>\n<p>Rob, I have to say, I don't think the issue is that these games aren't creative or don't create stories, it's just that you don't like the stories they generate. And that's fine, because I think <em>Burning Wheel</em> is kind of a crappy story-weaver myself, marking me as an SG heretic. That said, there's a big difference in saying "I don't like that story" (an aesthetic judgement) compared to "I realized those games are non-creative." And that should have been fairly obvious early on.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226824/#Comment_226824" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T18:55:50+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  6:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 7:03PM by madunkieg.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>I'm sorry, but I'm wholly missing where the "story"<em>isn't</em>here.</blockquote>I think that the difference is in how we deal with constructing meaning, or perhaps, to what degree we must rely upon meaning construction in order to play. I don't have to know what a King is to play chess, I just have to know how it works in the game. In a roleplaying game, when presented with a King, I need to have a general understanding of what a King is, but I may not precisely know what a King may do.<br/><br/>I think this thread's arguments run a funny parallel to the the very matter being discussed. When people get down to arguing the nitty gritty definitions of particular words, they can go on forever as we battle back and forth to control the language. Once a particular definition is chosen, outcomes can be arrived at fairly quickly, but they are often only tenuously related to the original point of view. Essentially, changing definitions is a bit like shifting the thread topic. Other arguments are presented through story. While we may not agree with the use of a word or concept in a story, we can often understand the general point of view being presented and explore it with counter-stories without ranging too far off-topic. Unfortunately, it's harder to come to solid conclusions from stories. In a sense, these two approaches are not dissimilar to boardgames and rpgs, respectively. And no, I don't think people's preference for one argument method or another has any connection to their preferences for boardgames or rpgs.<br/><br/>Bah, I'm rambling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226828/#Comment_226828" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T19:44:13+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  7:44PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>Situations?

Stuff like environments and characters exist, but even in relatively simulation-oriented games they seem to ultimately boil down to metaphors for how you do stuff with dice, cards, pawns, etc. The difference between Anglo and Euro board games is that in the latter the metaphor is weaker, but regardless the role-playing/imaginary space/whatever you want to call it is not the primary goal.<br/><br/>I'm not totally sure how to really articulate how I feel about it, but I think it's like, I really enjoy playing "let's pretend," and I'm willing to try out most any kind of game that will help that work better, but I'm not competitive/strategic/tactical/logical/whatever enough to sufficiently enjoy the game elements on their own. Without the let's pretend part, I don't really feel the need to do an activity that involves other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/threegee" title="threegee"><img alt="threegee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/threegee">threegee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226830/#Comment_226830" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T20:08:51+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  8:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really don't like word games like Scrabble or Apples to Apples.<br/><br/>Oh, sorry.

It was designed for two players, very quickly, and it wasn't perfect. But it had some good bits. My friend and I tried it, and had an interesting story. We both enjoyed ourselves; but it was clear that I enjoyed it more than he did. He seemed kind of... let down, after. But he decided to play it again.<br/><br/>So we did, much to the same result. He said to me after, "I think you've got some good ideas here, and this could be a good game. But it's not a game for me.". He stated the competitive elements (and the fact that they overwhelmed the story at times), as one reason. I think Rob had a similar moment here ("I'm sure this is great, but it's just not for me"), and it's actually got me thinking about a few things.<br/><br/>The other thought involves Magic. I've played that for longer than I've played RPGs, but probably less often - at least 7 or 8 years, though. And every time I play in a "serious" environment, like a tournament or at a card store (with strangers), I feel kind of "meh". Not bad, but not great.<br/><br/>But when I'm with friends, playing, I enjoy myself much more. And it's not just who I'm playing with. We still play to win, always, to the best of our ability. But A) We try to do it in fun ways, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> We don't really care all that much.<br/><br/>But, primarily, the "fun" I get when playing Magic is the same "fun" I get when playing many RPGs (Beast Hunters comes to mind, as does Baron Munchausen) - throwing each other into tricky situations and watching them escape. It's racing to find the right solution. It's doing something clever or tricky. It is, on occasion, drawing the right card at the right time.<br/><br/>I'm rambling here, but the main point is this: Both RPGs and board/card games have spectrum of playing styles, both within types of games and within a particular game. This isn't really news, but it affects people all the time - and I daresay there's interesting, not-fully-explored design lessons in that fact.<br/><br/>- Alex D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226855/#Comment_226855" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T23:43:23+00:00" title="August 22, 2009 11:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Tsuro was the big hit of the gathering</blockquote>Weird. I fucking <i>love</i> Tsuro and yet it has arguably the least story of any boardgame. Revising my opinion . . . now!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>Situations? Absolutely, check. Environments? Check. Characters? check check. Conflict-driven scenes?</blockquote>Okay, you got me. Something is <i>definitely</i> happening in most, if not all, boardgames. A story is definitely there. Why does it feel so different from an RPG then? Allow me to revise my "boardgames have no story" claim above. <br/><br/>Maybe it's that boardgames seem to focus on the destination instead of the journey. I'm having a hard time putting this feeling into words, but bear with me a moment. Boardgames and the social conventions surrounding them seem to encourage, reward, and acknowledge cool results. The micro processes of an individual turn pale in comparison to the overall win/lose result. The <i>awesome</i> in a boardgame seems to come only from achieving the awesome result, the win.<br/><br/>RPGs and the social conventions surrounding them finds awesome in everything from cool ideas, witty dialog, well-timed betrayals, big reveals, interesting twists, momentous die rolls (crits as well as fumbles), and even smart character backgrounds. The character background thing is especially funny, because RPGs are one of the only activities I know that reward you for playing before you actually sit down to play. <br/><br/>Many boardgames seem like elaborately detailed versions of a coin toss or High Card. In the end, I feel left with little more than the feeling of a win or a loss. Many kids games leave so much to chance that you may as well be flipping a coin because there's little to no strategy involved. For me, this simple result of A or B (win or lose) is not worth the investment of time it took to reach it. RPGs take a LOT of time, no doubt, but they're about all the little things in between winning or losing.<br/><br/>Comparing boardgames to RPGs, for me, is like comparing a movie's plot synopsis to actually watching the movie. The synopsis still tells you 'what happens' but leaves out all the good bits of the film. If this analogy were perfect though, the plot synopsis would have to take just as long to read as the movie would to watch. (This is where you chime in with a list of boardgames that play out in 20 minutes and I counter with a list that play out in 10 hours.)<br/><br/>The classic game Clue has the same premise as many classic RPG adventures. They both tell the same 'story', but I offer that the emphasis falls in different places. Boardgames seem to emphasize the mechanics, allowing the story to be fluff. RPGs seem to emphasize the story, allowing the mechanics to be fluff. This is why I will always argue that D&amp;D 3-4th Ed. is actually a boardgame, albeit heavy on fluff.<br/><br/>Damn. Now I want to go make mini-rpgs out of all those classic boardgames. Candyland, Clue, Mousetrap and the like would all make for some pretty strange rpgs...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Crowe" title="Josh Crowe"><img alt="Josh Crowe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Crowe">Josh Crowe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226859/#Comment_226859" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T00:51:24+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 12:51AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you first brought this point up I called bullshit.  The reasoning I had then has been pretty well covered by others here (use of the word "creative.")  So I think that aspect has been put to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nFact: Board games do not meet many of Rob's Payouts. And Rob has a high payout threshold<br/>\n<br/>\nBoard games are complex and have a steep learning curve to understand and enjoy(or they are simplistic and boring anyway). If you have fun mastering systems, that is a payout for you.  Other payouts are winning, mastering systems, developing strategies, executing tricky plays, learning obscure strategies.  I am further going to guess that Rob thinks all those things are a bore fest.  There are of course more payouts but I think that covers the topic well enough for this discussion.  So whatever you might call these things, like creative, Rob is not really turned on by them.  And to Rob's credit he has played Race for the Galaxy and Dominion and he gave them what almost anyone would call a fair chance. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we get to Werewolf.  Rob hates this game, a fact that had to be dragged out of him. And the game itself is very simplistic and boring.  Except for the human interaction part.  If you like "Lie to Me" the TV show or the study of deception and bodylanguage then this game is fantastic.  Rob does not, something he is very reluctant to discuss.  This goes to the general "human interaction" payout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCap that off with Rob's extroversion and you have a guy who does not just dislike things.  He dislikes them enough to talk about it, do a podcast about it and then start a prolonged discussion thread.  Extroverts need a high level of external stimulation to stay engaged.  So if you are an introvert it may be hard to understand his vehemence of this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter playing with Rob a few times my guess is that he wants to do this thing that he enjoys and he also wants the things that others do to entertain him as well.  I think the second part might be the most telling.  As GM in Misspent Youth you actually don't get that much creative time, but you are in a position to egg on people to entertain you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn conclusion, I think that "being creative*" misses the mark.  I think that is only part of the story.  I think Rob wants to be creative and hear others being creative as well, to keep his stimulation up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts on that Rob?<br/>\n<br/>\n*creative being defined here as being "what Rob likes to do."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226860/#Comment_226860" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T00:58:30+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 12:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like board games, but my best board game experience ever (chess against the sister of the junior champion, I still remember it) is not as good as even a mediocre RPG experience.

It seems you do, as various card games have been mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nA week or so ago, we played a game of Bang! that I think maybe you might have liked. I was the sheriff. My deputy was the first to go down (I did not shoot the deputy). The renegade, who can act as a deputy in a pinch (because his win condition requires that he and the sheriff be the last two remaining, then he has to gun the sheriff down) went down next. This left me with two outlaws who no longer had to pretend to have any goal other than taking me down forthwith. It was tense, and they were confident. A combination of luck (a lot of luck) and the right strategies kept me alive until the dynamite I'd begun moving around the table finally crippled one of the outlaws so I could take her out. Then it was down to me and the remaining outlaw. As we traded shots back and forth, it soon became apparent that the odds were in my favor. When the dust cleared, I stood alone, wounded but victorious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt no point did we actually roleplay in the sense of talking in character, or acting on motivations other than mechanical. But we did create a narrative nonetheless. One I still remember pretty well over a week later.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this sound like something you'd enjoy, or does it also fall flat?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226892/#Comment_226892" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T07:39:12+00:00" title="August 23, 2009  7:39AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh: I am touched and vaguely aroused with how closely you monitor my reactions to things and the elaborateness of the theory you've built up.

During it, I figured out why I'd rather do almost anything else than play a board game.<br/><br/>The panel was meant to discuss what makes a good game, and what one wants out of games. (The language in the title is purposefully overblown.) During the conversation we asked whether games can be good or bad (we determined they could be), what made a game good or bad (it does or does not meet its objectives), and what you want out of games.<br/><br/>My answer: I like to be creative with my friends. And a light went on over my head. No matter how good a board game is, it's not a creative activity. This is not to say that board games are for stupid people or that they don't take brains or strategic and tactical thinking, but they're non-creative. Even if I enjoy playing a board game, afterwards I find myself wishing I'd been creative with these people. If they're not into roleplaying games, then I find myself wishing I'd spent that time talking to them.<br/><br/>This was a satisfying realization for me. All of my gamer friends like playing board games and the most I ever say is "Ok, I'll do that with you because I like you and you like that." I was wondering why I was so weird. Why these people who I loved loved doing something that always made me feel quite "meh."<br/><br/>Now I know. I think.</blockquote>\nThis is a cool observation. I will state I can see this point of view totally. One friend of mine from HS is a master at the strategy board game. He also thinks in statistics, counts cards automatically and is a radiologist. That said his brain wiring is set up that way, where he really is not into traditional board games.<br/><br/>Personally I see many parallels between board games and the vast majority of Indie RPG designs as well. I have stated this opinion more than once, so I would ask where do you see similarities or do you not? Just curious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226931/#Comment_226931" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T11:58:48+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 11:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that I have read the whole discussion, I see what you are saying Rob. <br/>For me I do not want competitiveness in my RPG experience<br/>The only competition is the players (characters) in the very traditional simulationist gaming I prefer against the world/environment/setting/campaign/use the term you like.<br/><br/>I do enjoy cooperation and competition in my boardgame world and experiences.<br/><br/>You do not have to get as much from a boardgame as I do<br/>All good<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for posting Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228484/#Comment_228484" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T13:36:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  1:36PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can relate strongly to the statement that "I prefer RPGs to board games because they're about being creative together with other people", even though I agree that "creative" is a laden word that might not be quite the correct word for this situation.<br/><br/>I think it has something to do with story. Something to do with the whole "suspension of disbelief" circuit we have in our heads as human beings. Something about how we can invest in fictional situations and characters.<br/><br/>When I watch a movie or a read a book I'm really enjoying, I really feel an emotional link to that story. If I'm reading a wonderful novel, and suddenly the protagonist died, with no explanation, no statement, nothing, I would feel pretty upset, possibly for the rest of the day (depending on how much I'd been into that novel). It's a good thing "good" stories don't do that (with some rare exceptions). When I play a board game, I don't really experience that identification. Same goes for environments, worlds, cultures, etc--even though they're imaginary, there is a thrill in discovering them. People can feel "lost" within an imaginary world.<br/><br/>When I play a board game, I don't find myself imagining anything. I suppose I could, but it wouldn't be shared with the other players. And roleplaying games perform a little magic trick on us: they allow other people to participate actively in our imagination. I imagine a situation and I say, "You're playing George, Mary. What do you do?" In a tricky little sleight of hand, I've invested something I've imagined with a life of its own, through my friend Mary. My imaginary story, my imaginary world has come to life, it has become "real".<br/><br/>Now, I think that a Poker game or a chess match can be just as much of a story. It's a question of whether we're invested in the actors or lead characters. If you were to make a movie about a Poker game, you wouldn't just get two people to sit down and hang a camera above the table, would you? That wouldn't be a story to most people, because what's the point? What's at stake? That's why Hollywood can make a story about a Poker game, but they have to attach some meaning to the characters--so-and-so is the underdog, so-and-so is a villain, and the life of this Hot Chick over there is at stake!<br/><br/>Then anyone watching can willingly invest in that Poker game. I'm going to guess that for you, Robert, playing a game of Poker, or Settlers of Catan would be exciting IF it took place in the middle of a long roleplaying campaign, and the players in the game were important characters in the story, with each move have some impact on the fiction (even if it's just the hero's imaginary bank account that's at stake). Am I wrong?<br/><br/>By the same token, someone who is a Poker nut DOES see that footage of the Poker match as a story. Because he or she is already invested in the characters playing--they know who they are, whether they have won in the past, and so on. Something is at stake for them.<br/><br/>So, there are many common points. Players in a boardgame ARE being creative in choosing strategies, and their opponents can enjoy that creativity ("Ooh! Nice move!"). Players in an RPG are being creative ("Ooh! Nice plot twist! Nice characterization! Great French accent!"), and enjoying each others' input. Not so different on the creativity front, perhaps. Though I daresay it does feel different--probably because the playing field is so much more wide open.<br/><br/>Tied into that is the whole "premise/Premise/theme" concept: what does the story Say? When I last played Dogs in the Vineyard, I saw one player's Dog kill a young, unarmed girl to protect the medical equipment he thought he needed to save his mother. He was sure he was justified; I felt his character was a murderer. That was INTERESTING, right? I learned something about myself, about him, and about how I might judge a hypothetical situation were it to occur in real life. Very interesting.<br/><br/>...all that to come to the same conclusion as Ralph: this is pretty hard to nail down, if at all possible. But, Robert, I feel exactly the same way as you do. Enjoying the thread, too, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228667/#Comment_228667" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T00:31:03+00:00" title="August 30, 2009 12:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm much more interested in board games and card games than rpgs.

Sportsmanship and fair play -- and a clear social contract that we are *playing the game* and not each other -- are absolutely required for me to have a good time.<br/><br/>There are a couple folks in my gaming circle who never learned sportsmanship, and are willing to resort any means available to them to win a game. That includes exerting psychological or social pressure, kingmaking and other not-part-of-the-game techniques. And that kills it for me every time.<br/><br/>That said, I'm totally okay with games like Poker or Battlestar Galactica, because those out-of-the-game pressures pretty much ARE the game (talk about an Ourobouros of a definition, yikes!). There's not really enough tactical depth in, say, Poker to play it in a completely aboveboard, emotionally honest way. Bluffing, outright lying and other forms of dishonesty (everything except outright cheating) are accepted parts of the social contract of Poker, so it's all good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229011/#Comment_229011" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T13:07:41+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  1:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think "boardgame" kindles up an image in people's minds - Eurogames, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuits. Games that have set rules and set strategies. They are problem solving games rather than exercises in creative writing or story telling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut boardgames don't have to be that limited. For instance...<br/>\n<br/>\nA group of players lay out a map of London and pick characters to champion in a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Each turn they buy the right to make up a clue in the game. Another player decides how likely it is to exist. Other players may offer counter-arguments. What happens is settled by a dice roll. No one knows who did it at the start of the game but everyone knows at the end because the made up clues point right to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a story game, right? It's also a boardgame. I've got a whole line of games that work the same way to do murder mysteries, Cthulhu horror, action adventure and more. They are Engle Matrix Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nA board game is just a medium of play rather than what the play is about. RPGs started off as miniatures games but moved beyond them. Some Indie RPGs now (I'm thinking of The Mountain Witch) sound like they could be done as boardgames quite nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I like a good boardgame because it gives me a play experience that doesn't demand too much from me. It is a light mental exercise. Heavily creative RPGs (especially ones that require many sessions to play) ask more than I can give. They aren't bad for doing that, they just aren't geared for people in my stage of life. In the end it's all about being social.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10209/why-i-dont-like-board-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10209/why-i-dont-like-board-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10209/why-i-dont-like-board-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10209%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10209%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
