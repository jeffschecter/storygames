The demon-god is whispering madness to the captain of the enemy light brigrade, and the strangler queen summons her guards to interfere.  After the second round, the captain has responded to the demon's move and has the advantage, and now the queen has an opportunity to make a move.  She's happy to just quit, though, as she now feels like things are in hand.  The rules make it sound like you can't - so she tries to strangle the demon, and gets some unbelievably bad rolls so now the demon has the advantage and she's out.  Bummer.  She wished she could have just left well enough alone.<br/><br/>* Can you bring in a particular strength partway through a conflict?<br/><br/>We've heard that Vincent said yes, but don't know where that's written down.<br/><br/>* Even if you're not there, you can still roll conflict dice, right?<br/><br/>The captain and his soldiers attack a fortress on the border of the queen's territory.  The queen's particular strength is *not* far reaching, but she wants to roll to defend her fort.  I say "You can roll, but you can't use your particular strength."  Another player says, "That doesn't seem right.  I mean, she's not there."  Who's right?<br/><br/>* Where can I find that cool flowchart that Johnzo had?<br/><br/>I played with Johnzo once and he had a printout of a flowchart for conflict that was quite helpful.<br/><br/>* Is there an errata or FAQ or place I can go for more details and answers?<br/><br/>Googling "In a Wicked Age" hasn't been too helpful for me.<br/><br/><br/>Despite our clunkiness we still had a great time.  I've now had 2 awesome games of IaWA and 1 terrible one.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295563/#Comment_295563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T10:57:41+00:00" title="October  1, 2010 10:57AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the extremely exact flowchart I made, it might be the one:<br/><br/><a href="http://ryswebsite.com/2010/04/13/in-a-wicked-age-dice-map-handout/" rel="nofollow">Ry's Wicked Age Dice Map</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295566/#Comment_295566" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T11:06:25+00:00" title="October  1, 2010 11:06AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jamie,<br/><br/>This is how I'd handle those things if they came up in a game. You may get better answers from someone else!<br/><br/><b>Dropping out</b> - Once you commit to a conflict, you're in it. You can, however, negotiate before the last round of dice. So if you're in a good position, it seems to make sense you could negotiate a graceful exit to the conflict.<br/><br/><b>Particular strength</b> - You can totally bring a strength in after the conflict starts. I've played this way many times, mostly because someone forgot about their particular strength.<br/><br/><b>Conflicts far away</b> - I wouldn't let someone join a conflict they weren't physically present for unless they had a "far-reaching" particular strength. The rules say something about rolling dice when someone takes a "concrete action" and another character tries to interfere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295600/#Comment_295600" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-01T13:18:11+00:00" title="October  1, 2010  1:18PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the stuff you're asking for/about can be found here: <a href="http://random-average.com/InAWickedAge/HomePage" rel="nofollow">http://random-average.com/InAWickedAge/HomePage</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295686/#Comment_295686" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-02T01:51:27+00:00" title="October  2, 2010  1:51AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one additional question from our game (or a partial restatement fo the first question) is:<br/><br/>Can you pass your action during a conflict?  Say you're in a conflict to try to hurt a specific character.  That character gets removed from the conflict by a bad roll.  Do you still have to roll against someone else on subsequent rounds (possibly giving them advantage dice, etc)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295689/#Comment_295689" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-02T02:22:07+00:00" title="October  2, 2010  2:22AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2010 3:21AM by johnzo.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ry, thanks for that flowchart.  I realized how awesome it is on the day I tried to teach IAWA without it...<br/><br/>Brian's answers sound pretty good to me.<br/><br/>Cy, I don't believe you can pass your action -- if by "pass" you mean skip your action in one round but roll it in a subsequent round.  If you're in the conflict, you have to roll.  <br/><br/>If you want to leave the conflict entirely, you can negotiate your exit with the other players in the conflict.  If they won't let you leave the conflict, then you have something to roll for, don't you?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
