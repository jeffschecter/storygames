Similarly, the combination of authority and peer pressure acts to make ordinary people do things they would never do on their own, as in the case of Germany's <a href="http://german-history.suite101.com/article.cfm/review_ordinary_men" rel="nofollow">Reserve Police Battalion 101</a>, ordinary and otherwise good men. The toxic combination of authority ordering or turning a blind eye to illegal or immoral acts, peer pressure, and gross imbalance of power means this kind of thing happens everytime in these circumstances. Every time. The French in Algeria. Israel in the Occupied Territories. Japan during the Korean occupation. Koreans in the Vietnam War. It's such a human thing, not a cultural thing, though a totalitarian society with no meaningful checks on power and no freedom of speech go much, much further in its excesses. <br/><br/>Maybe the good thing about story games is that fictional characters have a much easier time overcoming this kind of push to immorality than real people do. Nevertheless, it would be interesting (if grueling) to actually have that effect in existence and overcoming (or failing to overcome) it, rather than its not existing at all in the fiction. <br/><br/>One possibility is the scene Aspects in Spirit of the Century. For instance soldiers might be rounding up villagers in a sweep for enemy collaborators, and there might be an Aspect like "It could be any one of them." In a confrontation situation with the locals there could be an Aspect like "The other guys will think I'm a wuss if I back down." It doesn't quite fit what I'm thinking of, though, because there's little buildup and each incident is kind of a one-off thing. For another, there's no rule to handle the continuing effect of such a situation on the individual and the society, where the second shot is easier than the first and the situation keeps escalating. <br/><br/>My Life with Master seems like another possibility (My Life with Captain?), though having an actual Big Bad Irredeemable Evil kind of takes away from the premise. It's possible that the corrupt command structure, or the situation itself is the Master and the endgame consists not of killing your commanding officer but rather raising public awareness, testifying in court, etc. The incremental aspect of the self-loathing rule suits my purposes, as in it becomes easier to follow questionable orders the deeper you're in. There's also a definite resistance element to asserting your personal morals. <br/><br/>Still, I'd like some more interaction between players than MLwM provides for, and rules to handle the increasing chaos of the situation. And of course, the characters should still be able to have a meaningful positive impact on the situation--but usually at personal cost. MLwM seems to be an approximate fit overall, but are there any other suggestions? <br/><br/>P.S: I've talked about military occupation situations, but of course similar things happen in lots of other spheres of life--corporate environment, politics, professional practice, and so on. These would also be good situations to play out with the rule I want. I'm also not slamming soldiers or the military; I think the real immorality is in the decision to force these people into an immoral situation, where it becomes all too easy to make the wrong choice and sometimes there's no choice at all. I think these are all interesting situations to explore, though I think it's valid to criticize that it's a trivialization of serious real-life problems. I don't know. I've been reading about this kind of stuff lately and maybe I just feel the need to get it out of my system.<br/><br/>Edit: Changed the title because mentioning the Milgram experiment in the title seemed to be misleading.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108133/#Comment_108133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T14:19:37+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  2:19PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi,<br/><br/><a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/evil.html" rel="nofollow">Acts of Evil</a> is a Milgram-esque experiment for me.

I remember reading a post about RPGs (in that case, Warhammer) as therapy. Of course, not all roleplaying games will have all the methodology and boundaries that the game in that post did. Nevertheless it's a good example of the versatility of the medium. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Jee, I tend to use Lacuna in this way.</blockquote>\nOoh, very lovely. I'll have to look Lacuna up. It certainly gets the pressure and the personal cost parts down pat. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>"The Milgram experiment" encompasses a lot of different ideas and results and concepts, but one thing that I think I would have a problem with in a story game is that some of the results are so counterintuitive.</blockquote>\nWhat I take away from the experiment is that no one is completely immune from evil and that morality is situational as well as individual. Therefore, first of all, it's important to instill a resistance to immoral authority in individuals, and second, decisionmaking structures should be examined closely for moral vulnerability including inadequate oversight. Very few individual acts are completely devoid of voluntariness, but certain situations such as authority and peer pressure do have a tendency to sway individual decisions, sometimes strongly. The important thing in my mind is to make sure that the prevailing pressure goes towards making moral decisions so that less Bad Things happen. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>I think that, if you're going to do this, it has to be along the lines that Graham describes: disguising the experiment under the context of something else entirely, a different game entirely.

It wouldn't be as ethically questionable as Milgram's original experiment, since there's no chance that players would mistake the characters for real people, but I kind of want to throw Milgram's conclusion in their faces rather than make them subject to the experiment itself. In other words, I want a game where there's a pressure to do immoral things, and giving into that pressure is advantageous in some way (which would be part of the pressure). Players would have to actively game the system to resist that pressure yet not lose out, which would be where the strategic part comes in. Or they could revel in their character's depraved acts, which is an interesting outcome in of itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daztur" title="Daztur"><img alt="Daztur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daztur">Daztur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108190/#Comment_108190" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T21:46:29+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  9:46PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that with a lot of games with personality mechanics, either the player is given very wide latitude to choose whatever kind of personality traits he wants (like TSOY Keys or SotC/Fate Aspects) or personality mechanics can force players into doing certain things (CoC and Pendragon).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the TSoY/SotC system is exactly what you said: "doesn't quite fit what I'm thinking of, though, because there's little buildup and each incident is kind of a one-off thing.

Each person will play a member of one of the many groups involved: US or coalition military, Shia militia, Sunni insurgency, Kurdish army, Iraqi police, Security Contractor, Iraqi Arab Sunni or Shia civilian, Kurdish citizen, member of the press, business person, business person, aid worker. On your turn, you play a character going about their business of trying to live during the war and occupation. On other people's turns you play people in that group who affect someone else's main character.

It's by Philip Zimbardo and it's a description of what happened in the Stanford Prison Experiment, and what lessons can be learnt from it.  The key point is that situational effects can make just about anyone drift into commiting evil acts.<br/><br/>From what I've read so far, the main mechanisms behind this seem to be:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Being in a novel situation</b> like a warzone, a prison, a lab, or a revolution.  In such a situation, the normal rules of behaviour obviously don't apply, but we don't know what rules <i>di</i> apply.  So we take our cues from what everyone else is doing.</li>\n<li><b>Being in a total situation</b> where people can't get away from what's happening, so they don't get a chance to take stock and reflect on what's happening.</li>\n<li><b>Invitations to be in the 'in crowd'</b>: people will do all sorts of things in order to be accepted into an exclusive club, to be valorised by those they admire.</li>\n<li><b>Incremental steps</b>: be asked to do something just a little bit dodgy first, then when that's accepted as normal, move on to something a bit worse.</li>\n<li><b>Dehumanisation</b>: the old classic.  If my opponent isn't a real person, they don't deserve my compassion.</li>\n<li><b>Deindividuation</b>: people are all the same.  If one prisoner is just like another, it doesn't matter if I hurt one of them, as another will be along in a moment.  It also works for those with the power, too: if I'm just one prison guard among many, there's some anonyminity which means that I'll never be made accountable for the effects of my actions.</li>\n<li><b>Perception of powerlessness to change the situation</b>: why try to change the system when it'll never change?  Surely it's better to look out for number one.  </li>\n<li><b>Neglect of past and future events</b>: what happened before I got in this situation isn't important, and I can't or won't think about what will happen in the future.  All I have to think about is what's happening <i>right now</i>.</li>\n<li><b>Having an authority figure take responsibility</b>: the classic.  It's not my fault, I was only following orders.  </li>\n<li><b>Either approval, or lack of objection, from superiors and peers (evil through inaction)</b>: if what I'm doing is really wrong, surely someone else would have objected?  As no-one else has, it can't be all that bad.  (This means that large crowds of onlookers are less likely to help than individuals.)  </li>\n</ul>\n(There's a <a href="http://www.lucifereffect.com/guide_tenstep.htm" rel="nofollow">list of ways to be wise to these factors and how to mitigate them</a> on the website for the book.)<br/><br/>I don't have any bright ideas of how to model this in a game.  What I think would be a powerful play experience would be to make these mechanisms operate on the <i>players</i> so that they get to choose to commit evil acts in the game.  I think that would be more fun than something in the mechanics compelling the actions available to the character.<br/><br/>It's also interesting to consider how many of these factors are present in the standard hack-n-slash game where hordes of orcs are slain without a second thought.  <br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108486/#Comment_108486" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T21:21:11+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  9:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>A good system for the sort of thing that you're describing would:<br/>1.

(Hint, hint.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>I'm working on a game about the iraq war to play on Saturday at jiffycon.</blockquote>\nSounds like an awesome game! Though obviously there's nothing awesome about the ongoing war situation. What system are you using? Also, I hope you'll put up an Actual Play post for my greedy perusal. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil</cite>What I think would be a powerful play experience would be to make these mechanisms operate on the<i>players</i>so that they get to choose to commit evil acts in the game.  I think that would be more fun than something in the mechanics compelling the actions available to the character.</blockquote>\nYeah, I think system incentives to commit evil would be much more effective than compulsion. The system could have some compulsive effects, like in Daztur's examples, but the players still need to have a lot of say, for instance through resource management. I'm reminded of Nicotine Girls by Paul Czege (I seem to keep coming back to Paul's games in this thread), where rolling against Fear has such a higher chance for success than rolling against Hope, so there's a definite incentive to keep building your Fear, which is extremely easy to do. However, it's rolling against Hope that will ultimately grant you the desired happy ending. I'd like happy (or at least moral) endings to be more likely than in Nicotine Girls, but it's a good example of system incentive modelling negative pressures. \n<blockquote>It's also interesting to consider how many of these factors are present in the standard hack-n-slash game where hordes of orcs are slain without a second thought.</blockquote>\nDehumanization?

The mechanics for pressuring ordinary people into evil would to use the metaphor of the seasons as much as possible ("winter is coming") to do the same sort of thing you're talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nRough outline of our very preliminary ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Each character picks 1-4 (depending on campaign type) grand themes (for example things like love, honor, country, law, religion, family, the big stuff) for most campaigns the GM would give the PCs a short list of campaign-specific themes to choose from.<br/>\n2. For each theme you pick one grand/quixotic/idealistic goal, something big and hard to get. For example Mal from Firefly would have something like "restore freedom to the galaxy." For the Reserve Police Battalion guy his goal would be "to make Germany the greatest country in the world" or somesuch.<br/>\n3. For each theme a character gets one aspect that represents how the character is currently approaching the theme. Maybe the Reserve Police Battalion guy would start off with an aspect like "make my family proud of my service."<br/>\n4. Each aspect would then either be in Summer, Fall, Winter or Spring. <br/>\n5. Going against summer/winter aspects would tend to push you along the year and into a new season, while going along with spring/fall aspects would tend to move you along the seasonal wheel. Depending on which season an aspect is in slightly different mechanics would apply. But more important than the mechanics is the theme of the seasons Summer = goodness/sanity/naivete Fall = worry/decline/experience Winter = hardened/depravity/madness Spring = hope/rebirth/redemption.<br/>\n6. How the game would work would be to constantly make a character's more summery aspects conflict with reality around them, their goals or with each other. If a character does enough things not in keeping with their summery aspects then they're pushed into fall and get too choose a new aspect that's in keeping with Fall themes and with that they've been doing. Make everything dependent on player choice, tempt them down into winter, don't force them.<br/>\n7. Once a character has some wintry aspects, put them in situations in which the wintry aspects and the summery ones tend to conflict and give them short term mechanical rewards for going with the more wintrty aspects, which would then push the more summery aspects down into winter. Again, everything is easier if you slide down into winter.<br/>\n8. Once a character is in winter then proceed to get a nice gallows ready for all of the rope the characters will have provided you to hang them with, but give them a way out (but not an easy way out) to spring and redemption.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample withe the Reserve Police Battalion guy <br/>\nTheme: Country<br/>\nGoal: To make Germany the greatest country in the world<br/>\nStarting Aspect: To make my family proud of my service (summer)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM then puts the player into situations in which there's pressure on him to do things that his family wouldn't be proud of, no railroading, just make it the path of least resistance. After a while the aspect is pushed into fall and becomes "I will do as the Fuhrer commands" (fall), by following the Fuhrer's commands the PC slowly sinks down into winter and is mechanically rewarded for doing so all the way (like in Fate the GM would compel his "I will do as the Fuhrer commands" aspects and accepting the compel would give them nice juicy Fate points and push them one step farther into winter). Finally the character crosses into winter and has to pick a new aspect for the Country theme, he picks "I wish that blood wasn't so hard to wash off my uniforms." Finally, near the end of the campaign things are looking bad for the PC (the Russians are coming and he's getting quite a reputation for evil) and he looks for a way out. He rejects a whole string of compels of his wintry aspect (which costs him lots and lots of Fate points) and by rejecting all of those compels the mechanics move him to Spring where he picks a new Aspect "I will atone for what I have done." If he accepts enough compels for that aspect he'll move back up into Summer, but it will be a long hard haul.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm should probably have written winter and spring aspects more closely tied to the Country theme, but I think you get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is the make the system as Faustian as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108504/#Comment_108504" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T04:43:26+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  4:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen characters in <i>Grey Ranks</i> go this route, particularly as they approach martyrdom or derangement.

That's pretty synonymous with "evil" in my book, but maybe you don't agree.<br/><br/>The PCs in <i>Sorcerer</i> possess a superhuman degree of will, but are otherwise not required to be anything other than ordinary people. If you line this up with some of the more subtle metaphoric definitions for "demons," you've got a system that should tempt ordinary people to resort to despicable acts in the pursuit of whatever they see as the greater goal.<br/><br/>As for modeling the Milgram experiment in a game... I can't help but notice traditional RPGs already have an "authority figure" that players may have already learned to defer responibility to. There should be a good way to build a game around this.

If your character ever feels okay about it, you lose sentience in the setting. It has elements in common with untitledrpg, but is much more visceral.<br/><br/>A similar system is used in Kill It With Fire; the players are severely mentally unstable, due to their line of work: incinerating the unnecessary. Every hit kills, and the players don't even have a stat for taking damage... but it all affects a tension gauge. As the tension gauge raises, BANG events happen. It's a lot like if you took Lacuna's heartrate and married it directly to Static.

If you want proressive temptation, you could do this:<br/><br/>1) Your Morality also measures the *least* volatile expression of your Vice that will regain Willpower. You can satisfy Greed by stealing at Morality 7, but not at 5.<br/>2) You activate another Vice you can access to get back WP for each Morality point below 7 (this was actually in the playtest). You can also "specialize" in a Vice by taking it again in lieu of a new Vice, up to three times, to multiply the amount of recovered Willpower.<br/>3) Your Virtue only rewards you with 1 Willpower (in current the rules, you recover all of it). <br/>4) Morality above 7 activates another Virtue for you to use, for a maximum of 4 at Morality 10. You can't specialize in a particular Virtue because a narrow moral focus is selfish.<br/><br/>The combined system encourages Bad Things because you gain more channels for awards, but you must exploit those channels in more extreme ways as time goes on. High Morality has similar rewards, but is harder to keep and cannot be exploited as a character development strategy through specialization. There is a powerful temptation to perform obsessive, selfish acts.<br/><br/>In the context of the Stanford Prison/Milgram experiment, the temptation is more severe because of the isolation and lack of consequences for violation, but it's not a perfect fit. I'm ot sure a reward-based system is appropriate in the context of Milgram.<br/><br/>Of course, there's always Powerkill and Violence, which, come to think of it, map petty nicely to Milgram and Stanford Prison exps, respectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108827/#Comment_108827" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T08:07:42+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  8:07AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've begun to take to Vice and Virtues in World of Darkness to create bangs for players that hinge on indulgence or preservation.<br/><br/>A while back I was working on Loyalty Enforcement Office.

Just a little personality test for me to see who thinks it's fun vs. who thinks it's unsettling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108925/#Comment_108925" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T22:14:49+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 10:14PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Emily Care</cite>Each person will play a member of one of the many groups involved: US or coalition military, Shia militia, Sunni insurgency, Kurdish army, Iraqi police, Security Contractor, Iraqi Arab Sunni or Shia civilian, Kurdish citizen, member of the press, business person, business person, aid worker.</blockquote>\nAre there any Al Queda terrorists or Iranian operatives in this scenario?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108968/#Comment_108968" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-20T08:06:45+00:00" title="November 20, 2007  8:06AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2007 8:09AM by Emily_Care.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Scott,\n<blockquote>Are there any Al Queda terrorists or Iranian operatives in this scenario?</blockquote>\nNot at present. I'm not sure I have enough information about them to support playing them adequately. Another group would be non-politically motivated looters/kidnappers.<br/><br/>We played the game at JiffyCon this weekend.
