About the Big Model, being it a... model, the way to test it would be to see if it model the "real thing" with the desired degree of accuracy.<br/><br/>The Big Model is not searching for a very big degree of accuracy, is drawn as a simple "box inside box" diagram.  To confute it, you should find smething that is part of the inner boxes that is not inside the outer boxes.<br/><br/>For example, you should find something that is shared between players (a part of the SIS) that is not shared during a social interaction. Or a technique used in a role-playing game that it's not used by people interacting with each other. Something like that.<br/><br/>Creative Agenda, as drawn in the Big Model diagram, is "agnostic" about the GNS CA Nodes (even if they are still part of general forge theory), so all it say about it is that for successful gaming, people have to be on the same page.

As an arbitrary classification scheme, it can be based on grouping together things based on real-world observable data, or based on subjective properties. Many studies have been performed on human behavior in casual social settings that have been rigorous. That means that you can potentially link the arbitrary categories to real-world observable data, but that in itself does not make them less arbitrary.<br><br/>There are very few classification schemes that we use that can defensibly be considered "real" and "fundamental to the natural world" rather than arbitrary. Some possible examples would include material properties based on phase transitions, and classifying things as alive or not alive, though the latter still lacks a completely rigorous definition (and thus maybe shouldn't be on that list!).<br/><br/>However, just because something is arbitrary doesn't mean that it isn't useful. The periodic table of the elements is an arbitrary classification scheme based on several real-world properties. It is super-useful, despite the fact that you could have picked other properties and found other periodic trends. It's important to understand the box that you're thinking in - the periodicity of atomic properties based on atomic number says that the number of outer shell electrons should determine chemistry, and this is mostly true despite the fact that heavy water is poison even though it has the same outer shell electron setup as regular water.<br/><br/>So, the Big Model = arbitrary. Actual data = great. Actual data + language that makes it understandable = useful. But that doesn't make your classification scheme objectively real, even if it is based on data as objective and repeatable as controlled chemical reactions. As such, it may not be falsifiable any more than the periodic table is.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214730/#Comment_214730" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T14:49:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  2:49PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2009 2:51PM by Eric.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Eric">@Eric</a><br/><br/>I don't think that the kind of rigor required for "the best way" is possible.</blockquote>\nIndeed.

The Big Model is primarily an arbitrary classification scheme. That is not wrong or bad, but neither is it inherently testable at all. That is the first thing you need to realize: there is good reason to think it may not be testable at all.<br/><br/>So, the way you go out and test the Big Model is first to determine if it makes testable claims. You need something like "Vampire games break up at a higher rate than Dogs games." Or perhaps "Vampire players show increased blood pressure and stress response relative to Dogs players after a set play time." Or even "Vampire players ought to answer this survey like this, while Dogs players ought to do that." <br/><br/>If you can make a claim in that fashion - and I do not know if that is possible - then the claim should suggest a test according to the procedures I outlined. If you can formulate a claim, I can help design a test for you. I do not personally know of a testable claim made by the Big Model.<br/><br/>edit: coming up with a really good testable claim is a fundamental challenge of science. I am not fucking with you here. It is seriously one of the most intellectually challenging tasks in science. The experiment itself is usually just following a manual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214737/#Comment_214737" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T14:59:31+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  2:59PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, if you don't think it's testable, this isn't the thread for you.<br/><br/>Everyone else.

The idea that, over time social gaming groups can begin to harmonize their social support towards certain ends, and if they do it's better?  Or maybe there isn't even that value judgement of better, (since I remember quite clearly there being passages saying 'hey, if incoherence works for your play group, that's great!') maybe CA just talks about existence, in which case you just have to watch for the harmonization.<br/><br/>"Social support" and emotional responses is a bit of a fuzzy idea, but if the players at the table can notice these things (which is required for them to be socially effective) then there's got to be a way for science to do so, too!<br/><br/>So, take some gaming groups, hook wires up to their heads and study emotional(?) responses to gaming events.  Maybe have cameras going so you don't have to depend on actual emotional responses, but instead physical tell-signs (in case someone is purpousfully giving off false signals to their group, you know, trying to look like their having more fun than they are.)<br/><br/>Classify gaming groups that, over long periods of time, have discordant social triggers for these emotional (?) responses, and then compare them to gaming groups that, over long periods of time, have harmonized social triggers for these emotional (?) reponses.  I don't really know much about how well we can measure emotions in people, even after sticking wires to their heads, so I can't say exactly what kind of comparison you could run with this, sadly.  Even if you don't have to compare intensity or anything tricky like that, I have no idea how much white noise will be generated in data of this nature.<br/><br/>So, summary: study the fine print on the difference between a gaming group with a CA (*any* CA, though it might be an interesting, less scientific side study to look at what kinds of gaming events are actually happening in patterns with the supposed harmonized social responses.) and a gaming group without a CA.  Get some gamers, and some way to measure each player's social signals.  Test to see if the stated difference between a group with a CA and an incoherent group exist!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214763/#Comment_214763" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T19:10:52+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  7:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay so something I\u2019d like to say before I respond: I\u2019m currently in my last year of my Sociology Honors / Applied Ethics Minor at the University of Victoria BC CA. I\u2019ve proposed, designed, conducted and completed three social \u201cexperiments\u201d with live participants while completing by course work and have met all of my method requirements for my undergrad. I\u2019m trained at the undergraduate level in qualitative, quantitative and critical methodologies for social research.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve found that describing social phenomena in the same way that the various positivistic or \u201chard\u201d sciences do is <i>abundantly unfruitful.</i> However, there is about as much consensus within the field on correct methodology/epistemology as there is here on \u201cRPG Theory.\u201d Actually, far less.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I would propose this:<br/>\n<br/>\nI was to conduct any research at all on RPGs, first I would in engage in a genealogical-historical survey of RPGs texts from the inception of the game and compare them with various other eras/texts, possibly grouping them by decade but probably by more suitable categories as they emerged. I would read them as instances of Foucaultian \u201cgovernmentality\u201d \u2013 that is to say I would attentive to how the game-texts engender the Players as subjects, what are the power relations involved in play, the cultural contexts &amp;c; \u2013 in short how do these text govern the players <i>specifically</i>. Having done this for a wide sample of texts (and by wide I mean like hundreds. All of the DnD core cannon, the major White-Wolf stuff, any other games from the 80s that seem relevant, the Palladium line, as may \u201cIndie \u201c games as I could get my hands on &amp;c.; We call this the \u201cgrey work\u201d) I\u2019d probably have come up with a number of conceptual categories and observations on the nature of the subjectivities that various RPGs engender.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all just Theory work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the \u201ctesting\u201d \u2013 well I don\u2019t see Big Model et al. as demographic issue. So I\u2019d advise against any sort of statistical brute force at all. Quantitative surveying is pretty much useless here because the respondents themselves don\u2019t really have a clear idea (neither does the researcher) about the salient categories. Another problem is that we don\u2019t have any clear idea of what variables we would use to infer these categories from. Quantitative surveying is basically impossible for this sort of thing simply because we cannot operationalize our concepts. This is a very difficult and important step in social surveying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever there is another way. Actually, like a dozen. What do you want you answer to look like? I\u2019m not joking \u2013 in social research the means beget the ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I\u2019d do something phenomenological. I\u2019d select my participants from two groups \u2013 hardcore RPGA types who only ever play the GAMIEST OF GAMES and then like a bunch of hardcore Indie design gurus who are all about gut punching emo porn. We call this deviant or extreme sampling. I can\u2019t think of a third sample group off the top of my head but it\u2019d be really nice to have a third deviant group. Essential even. I\u2019d conduct in-dept semi-structured focus groups and interviews \u2013 using regular play groups as focus groups. Maybe like two or three for each deviant category.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom here, we could go a couple of ways: one is to do \u201cpure\u201d phenomenological style  where I bracket as many assumptions as I can and come to the interviews with as little in mind as possible and just let the participants talk it out; letting various \u201chorizons\u201d emerge. Or I could do what is called Grounded Theory, wherein I do the first interview like that, then go to the second with all that in mind and let that guide interview <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> \u2013 and so on until I feel like I\u2019ve reached what we call \u201cTheoretical Saturation\u201d \u2013 basically when I feel like doing another interview isn\u2019t really going to give me any new information about salient concepts and relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen with my interview transcripts in front me, I\u2019d have to ruthlessly code and analyze them with the concepts and themes that had emerged either during the interviews or during my extensive \u201clit review.\u201d Having done this until my fingers bled and my eyes fall out of my sockets, I\u2019d probably hit the scholarly books seeing if it matched up with anything I found.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen with these new assumptions, theories, concepts and conclusions about RPG-play in hand I\u2019d go and compare them to the Big Model and see how well they aligned. I suspect they would be radically different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s how I would test the Big Model or kill myself trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least, off the top of my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214764/#Comment_214764" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-27T19:27:56+00:00" title="June 27, 2009  7:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I could probably propose like six or seven other methods that would be distinct but just a thorough.<br/>\nIf anyone wants to fund this study - I'd only need like a grant of say like a 50k. [haha.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to be much less formal: first you would need to rigorously develop definitions of what the Big Model is. We can't very well say that a policy is "racist" if we don't know what we mean by "race" (race is a terrible conceptual category - use ethnicity instead; it has a clear set of criteria.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this in hand, sit in on some Actual Play and record it (or take notes.) Go back listen what going on, what is being said - does your definition of Big Model aid in understanding what going on at the table? If yes, then great - Big Model is pragmatically true. If not, then see where it failed or was ambiguous - then propose a fix.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do admire about the Big Model is that it's mostly a descriptive account and not a normative one. I would warn everyone against moralizing while doing theory work.To quote one of my profs: "Once we take a moral position on a phenomena it becomes impossible to understand." Instead, I would follow Max Weber, and suggest sympathy in your theories - we often can only understand other by their suffering.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at when your players as human suffer and start from there.

I'm pretty sure it's part of the BM, I'm quite surprised to see no mention of it on that wiki site.  In my understanding of the Big Model the difference between Coherent and Incoherent is much more significant a concept than the individual types of CA that are currently acknowledged.  CA is, I think, the answer of "Coherent towards <i>what end?</i>"<br/><br/>Edit:I was thinking that "does coherent play exist" isn't exactly a falsifiable question; you can never really prove the answer to be "no".  So maybe a better subject of actual research would be "Do both coherent and incoherent play happen in statistically meaningful samples of gameplay?  Can we reliably reproduce them?"<br/><br/>To find out what agendas "really" exist I would just examine play groups until you identify coherence, and then try to analyze the patterns associated with the social reward cycle.  There might be something falsifiable in the Big Model regarding uniqueness of CA, I'm not sure exactly how it's stated.  If it's "well you could hypothetically have overlapping harmonic waves but I've never seen it," then you'd have a different situation than "No, the harmonics just can't overlap, no way".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214787/#Comment_214787" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T01:20:05+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  1:20AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 1:21AM by Number6intheVillage.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like every other theory of social interaction, it's just an interpretation based on a certain perspective.

There are *kinds* of Sim, there are *kinds* of Nar, etc etc. No one's ever really talked about that a whole lot, and that's always kind of troubled me. I always wanted the Model to be developed more in the direction of talking about how the larger GNS categories could be subcategorized.<br/><br/>As an example, when I was younger I played in a lot of groups that I recognize in retrospect as extremely Narrativist-leaning, where one of the primary tools was to set the books and dice and all that aside when we wanted to make story stuff happen. And like, I remember this as a ritualistic sort of act - if whole sessions went by where no dice were picked up, and it was all decisions and emotional resonance and roleplay and judgment etc etc, then we held it up as a pure example of what we were trying to accomplish. We would literally set the "game-y" stuff aside.<br/><br/>I still maintain contact with some of the folks I gamed with from back then, and I've shown them games like Sorcerer, Dogs, PTA, etc etc. And I've had more than one person balk at the very idea of using mechanics to create thematically resonant content in play, and I've never had any success at demonstrating how it can work to those individuals. But obviously it does work, because I've also experienced it working by playing those games with different people.<br/><br/>On a broad level, I would classify all of the experiences mentioned above as Narrativist experiences, containing the emphasis on creating meaning and expressing theme. But because the techniques used were so vastly different and incompatible, I also classify those experiences as worthy of distinction from one another.<br/><br/>If that's part of the tightening up you're referring to, I'd welcome it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214794/#Comment_214794" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T06:18:44+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  6:18AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lenny,<br/><br/>What you're describing is Story Now play using (at least) two different sets of Techniques.

Or, if you can't or you don't have the time, you ask question (but in this case you have to take in account the observer's bias, and eventual misunderstandings)<br/><br/>I don't think it's difficult to see. It's difficult to recognize, if you don't know where to look. I am not an "expert" by any means, but sometimes it's really easy to see a strong creative agenda in action.  It's much more difficult to observe incoherence (how can you be sure it's incoherence and it's not you that didn't see the CA?) when it's not very strong, to the point of dysfunction.<br/><br/>It's a matter of understanding, when you play a long time with a group, "are we really here together for the same things?" and "what we are searching for?"<br/><br/>I must add that I wasn't even able to UNDERSTAND the concept of CA (I though that I did, but I was confusing it with things like crunchiness or drama) until I experienced play with a different CA than the one I was used to. From your posts here and elsewhere, I suspect that you always play with a "Story Now" CA.

Well, interview a number of experts on CAs and ask them what specifically tips them off to particular CAs, or experiences where the CA was obvious to them. Find all the common ques for the experts.

I have to say, this thread is largely based on a faulty assumption.<br><br><b>The Big Model is NOT a "scientific" theory</b>, it is not really meant to be predictive.

In that sense, you can't really prove the Big Model right or wrong, you can only argue that it's more or less accurate than other models.<br><br>But one quick thing about non-GNS CA's---if you look outside of table-top RPGs, to the broader activity of "role-playing", then there are at least 2 other common CA's: "Instruction-ism" (using role-playing as a way to practice or learn non-roleplaying skills, like you do in some job training) and "Therapy-ism" (using role-playing for personal therapy, like you would with a therapist). There's also the potential "Social-ism" CA (using role-playing for purely social, non-GNS purposes), which is probably more likely if we're talking non-tabletop RPG "role-playing" (like cosplay).<br><br>But if we're talking strictly table-top RPGs, <i>*I've*</i> only seen GNS.

Read this like I'm grinning at you and handing you a beer while I say it: I know precisely what I was describing, thank you very much. Big hearty grin. Big beer.<br/><br/>I disagree with you, though, that the Big Model really <i>categorizes</i> what I'm describing, beyond a very general sense of saying "hey, this happens". Discussion of the specifics of any other level besides CA has always been eclipsed by discussion of CA itself, and there's very little out there about how the pieces-parts actually interrelate in action. <br/><br/>Perhaps because of this, I think there's an unspoken assumption in the air (big shocker, I know) that some sort of homogenous experience exists for different groups whose play falls under one of the larger CA categories. My practical experience suggests that this isn't reliably the case, because the technical side of it changes the experience enough to make the activities seem wholly different.<br/><br/>In other words, the broadness of the CA categories is woefully underemphasized. That's not me knocking down the Model, that's me wishing the Model would continue to develop past the current draft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214879/#Comment_214879" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T13:34:59+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  1:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leonard,<br/>I don't see how that isn't covered by the divisions of Drama, Karma, and Fortune for resolution. Are you talking about something other than that?<br/><br/>Absolutely, those three modes (separate, mix-n-match, whatev) will create a sort of play that feels different. To some extent, though, D &amp; K put all the Credibility in the hands of the humans, while F puts *some* into the randomizer's ... hands. To me, that's the only meaningful difference, and I must say that D &amp; F would only differ as far as the "disruptiveness" of the mechanics based on a) personal preference, b) how well-written the mechanics are, and c) how well they mesh with the group's CA.<br/><br/>Of course, all three of those things are very dependent on one another; both, say, a "Just Talking" RPG and <i>Polaris</i> use more or less exclusively Drama-resolution, but people might desire the "touchstone" that the Key Phrases provide in the latter, or they might feel like any kind of overtly structured resolution is disruptive.<br/><br/>Of those three factors above, however, C is the one that has been most overlooked historically, I think - if I don't care about tactical advantage, etc., then the mechanics won't help me establish Credibility for the things I care about. <br/><br/>At this point, I have to wonder, "Is Leonard going to pass me a beer now, or do I have a point?" ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214888/#Comment_214888" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T14:20:48+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  2:20PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 2:21PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>Leonard,<br/>I don't see how that isn't covered by the divisions of Drama, Karma, and Fortune for resolution. Are you talking about something other than that?</blockquote>\nI'd include talking about how those operate relative to different CAs, but I'd consider it the tip of a rather large iceberg. There's more to techniques than just resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>One pretty well-known example came out of discussion at the 20'x20' Room, when folks (Jim Henley, Ginger Stampley) posited the idea of "aerobic" Narrativism, which is a form of Narrativist play where the themes aren't front-loaded and allowed to emerge over a period of setup time, as a direct contrast to "anaerobic" Narrativist play where the themes get handed to you on a platter right from the get-go and you're expected to bang bang bang your way to resolving them. <br/><br/>If you have a strong preference for either, you're probably not going to get along in the other's group. But you're both Narrativists, so you should be singing Kum Bah Ya together by the campfire and embracing your collective artistry, right? Obviously, not so. In a practical sense, those two skewers are quite different from one another - there are other techniques that will go better with one than the other, there are social contract configurations that might privilege one over another, etc etc.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a more robust breakdown of those organizational relationships, taken across all levels of the Model. I think that would help people out who are trying to spot these things in their own play. I have some ideas about where I might start doing that, but the lack of discussion and free time sort of freezes me up. \n<blockquote>At this point, I have to wonder, "Is Leonard going to pass me a beer now, or do I have a point?" ^_^</blockquote>\nWhy does it have to be either/or?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I totally agree. That's my position too. I quite like the Big Model, but I don't think it's scientific or testable.<br/><br/>With that point made, if anyone thinks it<i>is</i>testable, do tell me how.</blockquote>\nMmm....   this is what I wrote in the post that sparked this thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>CA is testable. Not with the same scientific rigor that can be used to test physic theories, but still, it was "tested" by me alone with a big enough number of "subjects" to prove it to me.<br/><br/>It must be remembered that the Big Model don't talk about what people have in their heads, doesn't measure "immersion", or "enjoyment", or "personal imagination". It's a social model that talk about something observable: communications and gameplay.<br/><br/>A better communication between the players, a better gameplay (as in "with less problems, arguments and with people visibly more satisfied during the game and at the end") IS observable, and it can be observed, when there is a certain "coherence" between the player's idea of "what a role-playing game is" (for people who only play with one CA) or "what we are playing this time" (for people who change CA sometime). And more difficulties, problems, and lack of useful communication can be observed in gaming groups that lack this coherence, where people roll their eyes when some other player do something that don't align with their idea of what the game is.<br/><br/>It's not a subatomic particle, it's a very common phenomenon that every player that play with a lot of different groups and games can easily observe. And the Big Model (and the CA) is ALL about what can be observed during a game.</blockquote>\nReading again this thread, I think I have misunderstood what you were asking here.  I had said "Not with the same scientific rigor that can be used to test physic theories" and then used "tested" between quotes.  It seems instead that you want a _hard-science_ demonstration, as something you do in a lab with instruments.<br/><br/>What I talked about was this:<br/>1) The Big Model ONLY talk about what can be observed (or listened) during a game.  It doesn't talk about imagination, but only about the imagined things that are communicated (shared) between participants. It doesn't care about what players "like" or "desire", but only about what players DO. So, it could be said that when the model push for coherence, it doesn't do it in the name of a better "personal, subjective play experience" but in name of a BETTER GAME.  In the sense of "if everybody agree about what we want to create here, it will be easier to create it".<br/>2) So, there is no need to have telepathy or some arcane instrument to observe what the BM is talking about: it's observable.<br/>3) I think that comparing the Big Model to an Art theory is wrong as comparing it to a hard science theory.  It's a theory about human behavior, and it DOES make some prediction. I really don't know any good comparison that it could be made... maybe some psychoanalytic theory, but I don't know enough about them to be sure.<br/>4) It make some prediction, but not the one you search for:  you can't predict how a player will play on the basis of the creative agenda node where you could put the creative agenda of his group. Because there are a lot of different kind of narrativism, and a lot of different kind of Simulationism, or Gamism... you can say that a group of people is playing a game showing a clear "step on up" agenda, but this will not say to you if they like to crawl in dungeon or if they prefer to use their own brain to solve criminal cases.<br/><br/>So, what I am saying is that you can observe, with your how eyes, the difference between a coherent play (as in "these persons that are playing this game") and an incoherent one. And then, you can observe what creative agenda these people are using, if they do. And this "eyewitness observation"  is enough, for me, to test the BM. ESPECIALLY if I am the witness.<br/><br/>But I see now that you wanted a very different kind of "test"...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214919/#Comment_214919" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T15:46:46+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  3:46PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, no, Moreno, it needn't be scientific if that's not possible.

Such as having known a character who was the seemingly protagonist (or one of several), and then having them die. You react strongly. Think of many TV shows; it is not necessary for the character you've grown to like to die, but it is sufficient for them to suffer a minor setback, such as not getting into the school they wanted to get into for you to have an emotional response, <i>especially</i> if what they failed in had been shown as something they've cared for many times before in the fiction. You've grown to sympathize with their desires, and even desire their eventual success.<br/><br/>Now look at the unaerobic case, where you meet a character in a TV show and they die a minute later, or a character you've grown to love over the length of a book suddenly has a long-lost love which is introduced a couple of minutes before the credits, and hadn't been referenced before, it is much more likely you won't care for them at all. If you do care for them it is often because the writer uses the "Heavy Guns" of emotional manipulation, truly heart-rending sob stories, and if you recognize that attempt, you may accept it, but you may also grow to resent it.<br/><br/>Now, seeing as these are stories, it's all "Emotional Manipulation", but the value-judgment isn't inherent. After all, the reason they introduce the character and their struggles over a long time in an aerobic case is the same as when they bring the parental death, car crashes and abuse for the unaerobic: They want to make you care emotionally, they're trying to make you react.<br/><br/>Now, if you somehow wonder at the relevance of this so-called "Emotional Manipulation", let me show you cases from the real world: When you have a family member or a long-time friend who's in a bind, even if it's non-serious, you feel for them. Their issues could be minor, even from their stand-point, and you'd still care, because you care for <i>them</i>. But if someone approaches you on the street and tells you how their parents killed themselves, and now they live on the streets with their malnourished children, you'll know what is going on, that they are employing emotionally manipulative tools.<br/><br/>In the fiction, aerobic cases are also emotionally manipulative, because nothing there is shown for no reason. You are given calm and relaxed scenes so they could be used later as fodder for the loss and sacrifice.<br/><br/>This distinction is important because we tend to distrust "Deus Ex Machina" moments, where the emotionally manipulative tools are seen as such, and we hadn't had time to actually grow to care of the characters, their struggles, and the themes (it can be otherwise, but usually requires much stronger storytelling). The distinction is also important because some of us like to cut out the "filler" episodes. They/we (unaerobic) want one powerful scene after another, and they want each scene to have a message now, rather than have them mean something in retrospect through the eyes of the theme.<br/><br/>For an example, of a good aerobic anime and a good unaerobic anime, try Code Geass and Shigofumi, respectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214930/#Comment_214930" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T16:26:14+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  4:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 4:27PM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, what are you guys talking about?

Since the Big Model isn't really written down anywhere, and it's not really the brain child of any single person, that'll be tricky to validate. There are a bunch of things about which certain authoritative people seem to agree, so there's where you have to start. You can't use the essays alone because they're out of date and often trumped by bits and pieces of discussions strewn about the Forge.<br/><br/>Pick a part of the Big Model that you think is testable. I reread a bit of the three main GNS essays and there are some predictions in there -- not just editorial comments about Vampire or some other game you care about. Picking those parts of the essays (Jason, you know I'm talking to you) just allows you to prove that Ron doesn't like Vampire. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>The main prediction of the Big Model is that Coherent design leads more reliably to fun play, or that Incoherent design leads more reliably to play that is not fun. You have to dig pretty deep into the essays and read between the lines to see Ron Edwards actually come out and say this though. In re-reading "GNS and Other Matters of Role-playing Theory," I find that he mostly wants to talk through issues and not make those kinds of predictions. There are *value judgments* about how certain games of the past produced dysfunctional play for people, but those aren't really predictions. <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/5/" rel="nofollow">Chapter 4</a> offers this (emphasis in original):\n<blockquote>System, system, system. Or more appropriately, design, design, design. The listed elements in Chapter One (character, situation, color, setting, system, initial premise) may be organized to facilitate greater <b>coherence</b> in Chapters Two (GNS, developed Premise) and Chapter Three (Stance), and thus to facilitate more enjoyable play. This principle is often summarized in the catch-phrase, "System does matter."<br/><br/>By "coherence," I mean the degree to which a group of people can hit upon and sustain a shared Premise (or topic for Exploration, in Simulationist play) - and by definition, continue to enjoy the social role-playing activity consistently. The people do not need to agree in every detail or event of play, and they certainly do not have to conform to a single, immutable Stance or GNS profile. However, to role-play together most successfully, their shared agreements do need to go beyond simply sharing the initial Premise. To whatever extent they do this, they are cohering. </blockquote>\nThe thesis is, "The listed elements in Chapter One (character, situation, color, setting, system, initial premise) may be organized to facilitate greater coherence in Chapters Two (GNS, developed Premise) and Chapter Three (Stance), and thus to facilitate more enjoyable play."<br/><br/>This is testable, I think. Really, testing this aspect of the Big Model tests games that were written with the tenants of the Big Model in mind, to some extent. Here's how I would do it.<br/><br/>1. Select a handful of games incoherently designed and a handful that are coherently designed, according to the essays. Select a handful of modern (post-essay) games that people agree are incoherently and coherently designed, according to a survey of people. The "coherent" games should fall into various GNS categories, if possible. People tend to agree about the Gamist category, even on non-Forge sites. You can probably average a "coherency" score over a large number of people for each game.<br/><br/>2. Put together random groups of players to play these games. Keep each group together for the experiment to isolate interpersonal issues.<br/><br/>3. Have these groups play the games. They probably should play each game for several sessions. They probably should play a wide sample of games. They should be told to play the game by the rules. They should not be told what category a game is in. Good luck with that, since so many people have read the Forge articles. Better, don't let them know they're in a GNS experiment.<br/><br/>4. Survey the players individually, then as a group, to determine how much fun they had and what the problems with the game were. Also determine how closely each group followed the rules. (It'd be interesting for a game expert to review a transcript of play to determine how well the group followed the rules, too.)<br/><br/>5. Compile results. How well does a game's "coherency" score correlate with its "fun" score? If the statistical correlation is low, then the Big Model's Coherence theory is likely not to be true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214969/#Comment_214969" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T23:42:03+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 11:42PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Big Model is an argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nMethods exist-- such as the Socratic Method and law school Casebook Method-- to test complex, abstract (even subjective) arguments for internal contradictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo implement this test, someone would have to submit themselves to defending the Big Model vs. formal cross examination.

To some extent it remains feasible, but you need to add some additional axioms to the theory, most importantly that intentional or engaged play will leave behind a trace in the individual so engaged. Think of it as the relationship between play and learning. If you play a game and are focused on certain aspects, tasks, and events, then we expect you to retain those best out of everything going on during the game. <br/><br/>The result of adding this axiom is that we can start testing theories of player and group preferences by testing player retention after the game, using a recording of the game to construct our test. We can test the overall degree of retention as a measure of engagement - a rough test of the difference between 20 minutes of fun in 4 hours and the full 4 hours of fun. We can test the commonality of retention among a group's members, seeing if they do share the same interests - relating that with agenda (creative or otherwise) and using other results to test the CA coherence encourages functional play hypothesis. We can investigate ideas which are only barely explored in the current Big Model, such as single mode incoherence - where (for example) just because everyone is narrativist doesn't mean they share the same CA. <br/><br/>But ultimately all of these results would depend on two factors: the quality of the retention tests (which is difficult to calibrate) and the axiom which I added to the model. <br/><br/>After arguing about it on the Forge every time I brought it up, I ended up taking my axiom elsewhere. It turns out it can be more powerful than just something shoe-horned into an existing edifice. So I started using it as one of the first principles for my own theories.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215098/#Comment_215098" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T12:35:31+00:00" title="June 29, 2009 12:35PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 12:46PM by Rafu.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I suggest that one test it by attempting to determine whether it does, in fact, produce a common vocabulary which is intelligible and in which each vocabulary item has roughly the same definition (as a linguist, I expect a slight variation) between speakers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>The only problem I see is that the Big Model seems to produce a common vocabulary between some speakers and confusion between others.

You can only prove them false. Any experiment will need to be repeated before its results are accepted. <br/><br/>I think your four bullet points are common answers to <i>any</i> experiment. Try to prove that there are planets around other stars and inevitably, people will argue that you're asking the wrong question (what is a planet anyway?), that you need huge amounts of information (scanning thousands of stars for months before you find a single planet), that you need to understand a lot of background information (methodology for planet searching, metalicity, etc.), or that you need to do something practically impossible (science is still trying to invent the technology to "see" planets against the brilliance of their stars).<br/><br/>This doesn't make the existence of other planets mystical rather than observable. It just means science is hard.<br/><br/>If you had $10,000 to spend on a study, I'll bet you could carry out the experiment I offered and come up with a good answer about that aspect of The Big Model. It's just not worth $10,000 to anyone. <br/><br/>My last point about The Big Model is that it's <i>sorta</i> been science all along. I'm not saying it's rigorous. But from the start, people have put forth theories, then other people find/write actual games, actually play them, post actual play, and discuss how the play supports or invalidates the theory. Then people corrected their theories and started the cycle over again. It's not rigorous science, but it's basically loose scientific method. The experiments are terribly loose and uncontrolled, but it's all we have to go on, since no one wants to spend $10,000 to test any of this shit.<br/><br/>The other way the theory has been developed is by writing new games based on its ideas. Since these games have gone in directions orthogonal to what was there at the time and have produced successful play, I argue that there's some value/truth in the theory. Maybe all those designers just got lucky, but it's unlikely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215328/#Comment_215328" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T08:50:04+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  8:50AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>They're similar answers to the ones I'd get if, for example, I asked how to read auras.

Otherwise I'm testing first-gen rules against first-gen rules and we may have clarity issues instead of GNS-coherence issues.<br/><br/>If I want to pick, say D&amp;D 4th Ed as my Incoherent game because the DMG has all this Right To Dream fluff uncomfortably in there with Gamist Goodness what's going to happen when I present that as my test case?<br/><br/>That's right: argument.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215384/#Comment_215384" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T10:22:22+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:22AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 10:47AM by timfire.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've honestly been thinking about this, and for the life of me, I can only think of <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TWO</span></b> assertions that the Big Models makes. Everything else is purely a matter of description. For the most part, the Big Model is just about applying labels to various phenomenon. And to that end, you can't say whether its right or wrong, you can only argue whether its more/less accurate or useful than other categorizations and labels.<br/><br/>Both of the assertions that the Big Model makes are about CA---HOWEVER---the concept of Creative Agenda, in and of itself, is descriptive. It basically says "for what end or purpose do groups play RPGs for?" It then says, when a group shares a common purpose or acts towards the same creative ends, we call that "coherent", and when individuals exhibit divergent social purposes, we call that "incoherent". The model than labels three different CAs. <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything I've just said is about labeling.</span></i> You can't argue with it, and you can't "test" it. If you want to define things differently that's fine, but doing so doesn't invalidate the Big Model.<br/><br/>Now, the first assertion is easy to test---the Big Model asserts that coherent play is "more fun" than incoherent play.<br/><br/>The second assertion is tricky---the Big Model asserts that there are three primary CAs that exist within role-playing, GNS. And while the Big Model leaves the door open for more, no others have been widely accepted.<br/><br/>The trickiness with GNS is that a lot of the discussion comes down to labeling again. Most people that want to argue with GNS either want to argue with the individual definitions of GNS, or they want to change the scale or scope of CA. With the latter, they usually want to narrow the scope such that GNS gets broken up into more focused categories.<br/><br/>If you wanted to "test" GNS, the only way to do it fairly would be to accept the scope and definition that the Big Model provides. And when you do that, the vast majority of table-top RPG play falls under GNS. (Earlier in the thread I talked about CAs in non-table-top play.)<br/>_________________<br/><br/>I will mention that the Big Model makes one other assertion, but I don't think it's worth talking about---the Big Model asserts that role-playing is a social activity and thus bound by social/cultural conventions. This is the whole social contract thing, but that's social theory, not RPG theory. As such, it's an idea about life and society in general, not RPGs specifically. You could cut social contract off the Big Model and it wouldn't effect the rest of the model.<br/>_________________<br/><br/>Those are honestly the only two assertions I can think of. Can anyone else think of any other aspects of the Big Model that AREN'T just about labels?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215385/#Comment_215385" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T10:25:02+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "System matters."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215389/#Comment_215389" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T10:29:15+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 10:29AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Here's my problem with the experiment: Judging a game incoherent is done by the exact method as the experiment to prove GNS itself.

Does that mean there's no way to prove the thesis though?<br/><br/>Hmm ... you're talking to someone who thinks Incoherence, as it is expressed in the theory, is essentially wrapped tightly around a core of toxic identity politics that was hidden for most of the theory's formative life--so I do expect that any attempt to test it will, yes, yield a tautology (as seen). <br/><br/>OTOH, if we could excavate some of the analytical material from the incoherence-mess then we get decent stuff to talk about (like how <i>do</i> we get that story-goodness out of D&amp;D 4th Ed?). There might be a good generaliztion there that could support theory-style testing. I'm not sure at the moment what that would be though.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215564/#Comment_215564" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T16:41:49+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  4:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I confess up-front that I kind of gave up on the Big Model, but is there ever an explicit assertion in the Big Model itself about the primacy of creating "story" (with themes and premises and moral choices...which I suppose comes back to the problem/issue/reality of setting out definitions) as a core motivator of play?

Thanks for point out the incredibly obvious piece that I was missing-- that it is simply a motivation of play.<br/><br/>That said, I think the Big Model misses it.  At the very best, it'll be subsumed into social contract and kept from having any real implication for what's nested further inside the model.  At the very worst it'll be folded into a single creative agenda-- which does violence to the universal role the creation of story has had in our history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215814/#Comment_215814" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-01T14:04:14+00:00" title="July  1, 2009  2:04PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Or is the urge to "make story" folded into the definition of Nar?<br/><br/>p.</blockquote>\nNope.
