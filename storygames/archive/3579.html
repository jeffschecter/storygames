Best bet, for my money, is just to find the keys that would let the GM cash in most readily if he happened to GM a session where the story turned out that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nA full story (like a movie or something) will probably consist of several distinct situations (and would play as several ~1-hour sessions of <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>).  Each situation is created by combining a Tension card and a Stakes card (as inspired by <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3485&amp;page=1#Item_38" rel="nofollow">Cross-Product your way to situation</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nTENSION (GM draws a card when he introduces one of the listed story elements ... the GM's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3565&amp;page=1#Item_14" rel="nofollow">Countdown Clock</a> is turn back a notch each time a player wins any stakes listed in the cards "Buy-In")<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Rivalry<br/>\n- An advantage an NPC or group has that a PC cannot attain<br/>\n- A prize only one group may attain<br/>\n- A vulnerability of an NPC or group<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of public victory<br/>\n<br/>\nObstacles<br/>\n- The perfect opportunity thwarted at the last moment<br/>\n- Time pressure<br/>\n- The outcome of the last "solution" is the next problem<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of ???<br/>\n<br/>\nPursuit<br/>\n- Danger in front, pursuers close behind<br/>\n- A close call<br/>\n- A chance to cover a lot of distance quickly<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of delaying or distracting pursuers<br/>\n<br/>\nOppression<br/>\n- Rules get in the way of human needs<br/>\n- What's important is obedience, whatever the orders<br/>\n- Wildly disproportionate punishment<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of hiding something from the authorities<br/>\n<br/>\nMystery<br/>\n- The truth obviously concealed<br/>\n- A new truth that seemingly contradicts an old one<br/>\n- One of these things just doesn't belong<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of finding evidence to support your theory<br/>\n<br/>\nInfighting<br/>\n- Something or someone two groups are vying over<br/>\n- Something two groups have in common<br/>\n- A vital message not received<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of proving where you belong<br/>\n<br/>\nDisaster<br/>\n- An unfocussed, general danger<br/>\n- A temporary safe haven<br/>\n- A dangerous gauntlet to be traversed<br/>\nBUY-IN:  Stakes of ???</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAlso, if anyone has ideas for what story elements would encourage: Suspense, Entanglement (e.g. "You mistakenly get the McGuffin, and are pulled into the story against your will") or The Natural Order Disturbed (e.g. Mind-switch episodes) that would be great.

Maybe it'll be beloved, maybe it won't, but you don't have to wonder "How do I make such a film?"<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal here is to provide the GM with a solid formula that she can follow unilaterally.
