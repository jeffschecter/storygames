(Different groups have different agendas.)<br/><br/>The ritual phrases of Polaris &amp; Archipelago are this, right? By making procedures for disagreement we can take some of the emotional edge away, make sure everyone gets heard, negotiate which idea makes it in, all kinds of good stuff.<br/><br/>But suddenly I think we're only scratching the surface, because there is a freaking plethora of these things.

Finger voting and the strict constraint that you must not comment or suggest when someone takes their turn.

The scene initiator schedules, picks the location, and sets the nominal agenda, but it would be totally on-point if the group were to adopt a formal meeting process to run the scene from that point... I might have to add that, in fact.<br/><br/>My two cents from my own history of attending/organizing meetings: The (useful, yet self-parodying) Extreme Programming methodology calls for meetings to be held standing up, with one effect being that sheer physical discomfort motivates people to get to the point. Can that be hacked so that we start out in an emotionally uncomfortable place as a speed-increasing pacing aid, so that we deal with the meat of the scene and quickly move on? We could intentionally start close to a veil, pull ourselves together for a very quick scene with a subject that we're uncomfortable with but that we know will help tell our story, then, without regret, drop the veil and end it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323839/#Comment_323839" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T17:11:41+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  5:11PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the basic ideas are the best.<br/><br/>Simple facilitation: if someone hasn't talked for a while, ask them what they are doing.<br/><br/>Open questions: hey, Player Character, how do you feel about that guy over there?<br/><br/>Time management: 30 minutes to go.

For background, I'll say that we've been playing for a couple of weeks in this new sandbox campaign, and the game is going hot: near dozen different players cycling through the game, sessions 2-3 times per week. The nature of old school D&amp;D is such that you need plenty of meeting procedure to make the game go anywhere:\n<ul><li>A session begins by players deciding what endeavour their adventuring party is taking up this time. For effective decision-making there needs to be players who push the decision-making process onwards, make suggestions and conclusions from the discussion. I don't coordinate this process as a GM except for reminding the group about what they should be doing and consistently suggesting them how they might organize themselves: pick a party leader, have the leader prepare and introduce propositions, vote on disagreements, introduce new characters to replace the fallen, etc.</li><li>The number of players per session has ranged from two to eight. When we get over four, the group basically needs to party leader in the field just to keep their shit together - the dungeoneering takes huge amounts of time if somebody isn't constantly pushing for new decisions: will we proceed, which way we'll go, is there something else to be done in this location and so on.</li><li>At the end of the session the group also needs meeting procedures to split the loot effectively. They need to assess treasure, assign experience points, divide shares for their newly incorporated syndicate, pay off the logistical train and so on. Again, the most effective sessions in this regard have been the ones where somebody who is not the GM keeps lists of issues under consideration and chairs the events.</li></ul>\nI've myself very much encouraged the players to consider D&amp;D a GM-less game for the most part; the game simply doesn't run in its full expression if the players expect the GM to be present for them as a driving force as well as a referee. My strategy in this regard has been to explicitly ask active players if they could make sure that the game moves by adopting leadership roles as necessary. I'm also being very pointed about simply prepping my adventure materials while the players work through the logistical portions of the game described above. The group is slowly getting accustomed to the idea that the basic game-structuring and chairmanning duties are actually separate from refereeing duties in this campaign; while in almost any other game it's part of the GM's job to ask "what's next?", here the task falls on the internal organization of the adventuring group, and ideally the GM never needs to ask them whether anybody's actually going to do something or if they're just going to camp indefinitely in the foyer of the <i>Tomb of the Iron God</i> and chatting about inconsequentalities.<br/><br/>The interesting point here is that this necessary organization of a full-depth D&amp;D game straddles the fiction and real-world game organization in a funky way - the meeting organization stuff is not the rules of the endeavour, but it's still there and critical to successful play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/danpuckett" title="danpuckett"><img alt="danpuckett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/danpuckett">danpuckett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323902/#Comment_323902" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T08:45:16+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  8:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 8:45AM by danpuckett.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Thanks, Jason.  After I finish posting this, I'm definitely<br/>\nadding "insano" to my resume.</p>\n<p>"Accounting" -- I deeply sympathize with your antipathy<br/>\ntowards having "meetings" during your relaxation time.  Most<br/>\nmeetings are at best limp experiences and at worst<br/>\nmiserable.  The thought of bringing those experiences out of<br/>\nthe workplace and into my games doesn't attract me at all.</p>\n<p>That said, I'm even more interested in effectiveness when it<br/>\ncomes to leisure time than I am at work, mainly because I<br/>\nhave more of a personal stake in it.  I don't want to waste<br/>\nmy time when I'm wasting my time--I want to get the most I<br/>\ncan out of it.  If there's stuff I can grab from the<br/>\nworkplace that can help me have more fun, I'm all for it,<br/>\nand if calling them "group interactions" rather than<br/>\n"meetings" makes workplace facilitation techniques easier to<br/>\nsell, then I have no problem with that.</p>\n<p>It strikes me that there's a big intersection between<br/>\ngetting stuff done at work and playing games outside of<br/>\nwork: goal-directed activity.  To the extent that the fun in<br/>\na particular game comes from collaboratively striving to<br/>\nachieve goals, then we may be able to increase our fun by<br/>\nusing techniques from the workplace, where we get paid to<br/>\ncollaboratively strive to achieve goals.  Not all fun in<br/>\ngames comes from goal-striving, certainly, but to the<br/>\nextent it does, the idea seems worth exploring.</p>\n<p>So let's dig a little deeper into the nature of group<br/>\ninteractions.  If you were to ask me what techniques you<br/>\nshould use in any particular group interaction, the first<br/>\nquestion I'm going to ask you is, "What do you want?"</p>\n<p>At work, we have meetings to...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>align people toward a common goal</p></li>\n<li><p>brainstorm options for achieving a goal</p></li>\n<li><p>plan how to execute a goal</p></li>\n<li><p>execute a plan (rarely)</p></li>\n<li><p>share understanding of a complex system</p></li>\n<li><p>report on progress toward achieving a goal</p></li>\n<li><p>learn something new</p></li>\n<li><p>reflect on past experience so we can improve</p></li>\n<li><p>change how everyone feels (e.g., celebrate completion of<br/>\na big project)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>...and so on.  There are less-savory, frequently-tacit<br/>\npurposes like "lay blame" and "justify" and "shame" and<br/>\n"obligation" behind many of these meetings, but the overt<br/>\npurposes listed above seem to be valuable enough, if we can<br/>\nonly accomplish them.  Though I'm the most casual of<br/>\ncasual gamers, I would wager that all of you can come up<br/>\nwith gaming situations that might map into any of those<br/>\ncategories above, plus adding a few categories of your own.</p>\n<p>My point is that before we talk about techniques, we need to<br/>\nfigure out what we're trying to accomplish in any particular<br/>\ngroup interaction, because effectiveness of a technique<br/>\ndepends on what you are trying to accomplish.  If you are<br/>\nclear that, for example, at this point in the game you want<br/>\nthe players to brainstorm options, then I can suggest<br/>\ntechniques like mind-mapping or sticking up Post-its or<br/>\nwhatever.  If you don't have clarity about what you want,<br/>\nthough, it's hard to say what might work well in any given<br/>\ngroup interaction.</p>\n<p>Rather than writing about specific techniques, then, let me<br/>\nadvocate for three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>As a game designer, know the specific type of any group<br/>\ninteraction you set up.  That means mapping the<br/>\ninteraction into either one of those categories above or a<br/>\nnew category of your own.  The point being that you know<br/>\nthe purpose of every group interaction.</p></li>\n<li><p>Provide the players with techniques that support that<br/>\ntype of interaction and leave out techniques that don't<br/>\nsupport it, no matter how cool they are.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure the players are crystal-clear as to what you<br/>\nwant them to achieve in any interaction.  If one player<br/>\nthinks that they're here to generate options and another<br/>\none thinks that they're here to plan a course of action,<br/>\nthen they're going to get frustrated with each other very<br/>\nquickly.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that you have to lock people in.  If you<br/>\nwant to give your players the option to move from one<br/>\npurpose to another within the same meeting, think about<br/>\nhow to make those transitions explicit in the game rather<br/>\nthan implicit, and how the techniques you offer can change<br/>\nto support them.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's all that comes to mind at the moment.  Thanks for<br/>\nreading this.  I'm interested in hearing your reactions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324177/#Comment_324177" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T15:36:46+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  3:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: danpuckett</cite>That's all that comes to mind at the moment.

The goal there is to "brainstorm options" (obviously) - gives everyone a voice, puts a lot of clay on the wheel.<br/><br/>Then there's a voting stage where everyone chooses which character they want as their main - I'm not sure how that fits in with Dan's agenda list, perhaps it's "plan how to execute" - but there we're culling our big pot of ideas down to our best ideas.<br/><br/>Then, an amusing way to look at Geiger Counter is the game culls our ideas in the story, instead of just leaving them out altogether. "Nobody really liked that character. Aaaand ... now he's dead."<br/><br/><br/>So what I've been thinking about is can any of these other techniques become cool procedures that make cool games like Geiger Counter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324402/#Comment_324402" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T23:34:07+00:00" title="May 13, 2011 11:34PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been seeing a lot of similarities between the design thoughts behind Archipelago and Scrum/agile. Facilitating groups. Getting everyone on the same page. Getting everyone invested in the process. Setting short-term, concrete goals. Flat team structure. Getting everyone to contribute, get their voice heard. <br/><br/>Graham got me thinking: The difference between a game like Archipelago and a goal-focused meeting is that in the game, you show up with a vague motivation, possibly even diverging ideas of what's about to happen. One of the things the game helps you do is reach a group consensus. There's a reason I put the "forming, storming, norming, performing" essay in there.<br/><br/>Dan, good post. You emphasize that the designer needs to be very conscious of what they want to do; in roleplaying game design, I don't necessarily think that's true. One of my games I'm most happy with was designed intuitively, over many iterations - not engineered to do what I wanted, so much as reverse engineered so I could figure out why it worked when it worked. ("Huh, so I need to put this piece back into the design, because it was less fun without it. Why? What does that piece actually do?")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324419/#Comment_324419" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T08:43:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  8:43AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Dan - solid gold post.<br/><br/>I love thinking about  using our facilitation to shape the kind of social interaction in an intentional way. I also agree heartily that clear communication is also key. <br/><br/>Another thought. Techniques can be brought to bear both on the design level, and at the table. A good design has appropriate facilitation techniques "built in", a good facilitator, can make an incomplete design work by introducing appropriate techniques at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
