Everyone knows what Mormons are like, and everyone knows what Westerns are like, so stick the two together and hilarity happens.<br/><br/>I was hoping someone would think of something that does not depend on genre emulation, though. Something that maybe has not been tried yet, or has not been tried to any great extent. There must be someone on these boards who taught a group of players a fairly detailed setting that was not pure genre tropes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226997/#Comment_226997" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T22:13:19+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 10:13PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: threegee</cite>people who read gamebooks instead of fiction do not count.</blockquote>\n*Headtilt*<br/><br/>Are you telepathic, by any chance, to know why "those people" read what they do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227013/#Comment_227013" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T23:16:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 11:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to be fair, it's less of a genre emulation thing in the way I described it. Wu xia is a genre, sure, but my point was that there's an appendix of DOZENS of very specific and wildly different play styles, settings, tropes, and visuals. Let me find a couple examples:\n<blockquote><cite>Mist-Robed Gate</cite>Based on a popular wuxia novel series, <i>The Swordsman</i> films produced by Tsui Hark offer classic <b>Mist-Robed Gate</b> action: many factions such as the black-magic-using hillfolk and Japanese samurai with opposing personal and institutional goals, catchy traditional Chinese music, extreme romantic complications and super-low-budget sets and props... There are plenty of female as well as male martial artists, making it a particularly good choice for those interested in gender in kung fu films.</blockquote>\nThat would inspire a wildly different game than, say, this:<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Mist-Robed Gate</cite>This anti-war epic may not be all swords, blood, and exotically-colored cloth-- the film's chief color is gray and its weather pattern is the kicked-up dust of battle under the scorching sun-- but it still contains the seeds of a <b>Mist-Robed Gate</b> game. Three brothers played by Jet Li, Andy Lau, and Takeshi Kaneshiro get caught up in different sides of a deadly political conflict in late 18th century China, when riflemen are able to (melodramatically) gun down the traditional sword-wielding warriors with ease. Amidst the carnage comes the loyalty-shifting politics of men whose self-interest and blind obedience wax and wane with each new crisis situation, eventually destroying them all in a morally ambiguous epic battle that will leave your ears ringing.</blockquote>\nThey both have two things in common-- kung fu and shifting factions-- but ultimately they're extremely different, and you've got a concise, rich situation to mine. <br/><br/>The book also says you should make some snacks and talk about what you think is fun about the situation you choose, and to not rush the part where you figure out what everyone's into and wants to play. That's important for depth, and doesn't require reading more than one brief paragraph of movie synopsis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/threegee" title="threegee"><img alt="threegee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/threegee">threegee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227027/#Comment_227027" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T00:02:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point.

I can still see problems if one or more players have not seen at least one film in that particular style. I think I need to grab some players to put Mist-Robed Gate to the Actual Play test and see for myself how it works in practice. In your experience, can players get on board with a setting when they start the game not even being able to spell Qing, much less describe the appropriate title for one's teacher?

She thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and her characterization was spot on, nothing stuck out or felt awkward. Instead of using appropriate Chinese words or anything, we tended to go for elaborate descriptions that sounded appropriate. And it was relatively soon after we moved here, and we hadn't gotten a chance to play together much with any of the people attending-- I think the game actually had nine or ten players, half of them from out of town. So come to think of it, while some of the people in the group were really comfortable with playing with some of the other people, no one there was really used to playing with everyone else. I think the big success was that the game was equally fun for Meg and for Jonathan Walton, who's China geek extraordinaire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/threegee" title="threegee"><img alt="threegee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/threegee">threegee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227134/#Comment_227134" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T08:25:12+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.

In fact, I would love to know the number of Nobilis players vs. number of books sold (and read).

The closest I think you're likely to get to full buy-in to a given setting is when all the players feel some ownership of the setting, and are interested in where its going because they helped make it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227402/#Comment_227402" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T20:48:11+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 8:50PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a good way to avoid the "nobody hates it, but nobody loves it, either" pitfall of group world creation?

If Gamer Jim comes to the game faithfully each week, but doesn't seem interested in the setting that the group is creating, I don't know that there's anything that can be done to *make* him care.<br/><br/>If he's otherwise an engaged and fun player, then so be it. If he's otherwise a disengaged dude who has nothing better to do on Wednesday nights, then that's a social problem (or not, depending on all sorts of other stuff). Either way, I think his lack of caring is beyond the scope of any rules to address.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227546/#Comment_227546" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T09:30:56+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  9:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shouldn't it be called <i>Being Ron Edwards</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227555/#Comment_227555" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T09:50:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  9:50AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: threegee</cite>We all know that no player in the history of gaming has ever read a gamebook that was not all about statistics or other minutia that could provide an in-game advantage.

How?</blockquote>\nHrm.<br/><br/>One idea I came up with a while back but never had a call to actually try out was to give the individual players incomplete but inter-related information. I was thinking somehting like card-sized infodumps. I guess a GM could hand them out as appropriate to the characters being created byplayers with just a brief overview of the setting.<br/><br/>I suppose this is probably easier in an electronic format for the GM to work with than a hardcopy format, or with one of both.The players can then always refer later on to the full hardcopy document if they wish to inform themselves more fully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
