He's also a teacher to children from 3 to 5 years of age. He kindly offered to play Happy Birthday, Robot! with his class and send me the resulting story. <br/><br/><br/>Happy Birthday, Robot!<br/>Robot is sad because he thinks he's the only robot left.<br/>Robot is wrong but he doesn't know it.<br/>There was a huge war between robots but he's the only good one.<br/>So other robots came and to try to destroy him.<br/>Robot destroys'em all but is again sad and lonely.<br/>Robot knows how to build other robots, but couldn't because he had no pieces.<br/>The other robots are now all destroyed and junk.<br/>Robot rebuilds them because he knows how to do it.<br/>Now the other robots are good too, and robot has many friends!<br/><br/><br/>This is my slight edit of Ariele's translation from Italian into English, so the wording might be a little clunky. Well, actually, no that wording is pretty typical for a Robot story! :P It's nice to know that even though the game is designed for the "clever ten-year-old" audience, a very young kid with adult guidance can play, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262219/#Comment_262219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T07:57:58+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  7:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2010 7:59AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow! Fantastic.<br/><br/>Some of the story seems to go back and just about contradict earlier lines, though. Any chance we can get some of the story behind the story from your friend? I wonder if there was some wrangling going on there, with some people wanting the story to go one way, and others wanting it to go the other way, or if some guidance from the teacher was involved? I'd love to hear more about how it went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262224/#Comment_262224" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T08:10:11+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  8:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ariele said the kids had some difficulty with the rules, but were trying really hard and ultimately enjoyed making the story.

With that approval, I'll try to raise enough funds to pay for the first printing of full color hardcover books, roughly the same size and shape as a high-end children's storybook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
