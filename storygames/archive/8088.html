Since then I've been busy emigrating to Australia, but am now in a position to consider running another mission for the rest of the family.<br/><br/>A question, though. If someone is promoted from, say, Corporal to Sergeant, do their available weapons change? For instance, does the new sergeant automatically gain a Sidearm. And (of more importance) does he lose the Grenades?<br/><br/>Same fro demotion. A Lieutenant is allowed a Power Claw. Does he lose it if busted down to Sergeant?<br/><br/>I guess my question is: are the available weapons for each rank for 'starting characters' only?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178263/#Comment_178263" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T01:55:16+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  1:55AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, hope the move went well!<br/><br/>The way I play it is that you gain new guns and gear when you go up in level and don't lose what you had before (so I've commonly seen Sergeants with E-cannons ... and a crappy NFA). On demotion I've left them keep sidearms they had a Sergeant, but on reflection maybe I should have made a big deal of them having to turn their Sergeant stuff back in? The things like Drop Pods and Starkiller Missiles don't stay with you when you get busted back down though. But that's just my take.<br/><br/>So, I guess my laissez-faire attitude is that any weapons they could get with a Development Roll they can keep (PowerClaw, Shotgun, Flame Gun, E-Cannon, etc.) but the trappings and Special Stuff of the higher ranks has to go when they get demoted by Court Martial.<br/><br/>(I do like the idea of a player arguing to keep a TPK bomb by hiding it... hmm, make me an NFA check.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold" title="kaptainkobold"><img alt="kaptainkobold" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kaptainkobold">kaptainkobold</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178264/#Comment_178264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T03:02:15+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:02AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The move went well, yes. <br/><br/>Thanks for the reply.<br/><br/>One thing that crossed my mind afterwards is whether there is a limit on what weapons a soldier can carry. In our group Trooper (formerly Corporal) Bonzo is already touting a pulse rifle, e-cannon and rocket pods, which seems a lot of kit really. I was thinking that perhaps there should be some kind of limit on carrying heavy weapons.<br/><br/>Perhaps an encumberance rating for each weapon - 0 for things like grenades, sidearms and power claws, 1 for pulse and slug rifles or shotguns and 2 for other weapons. A trooper could then be limited to an encumberance of 3. 4 if they are willng to take a -1 on FA/NFA rolls* So, if you have both a rocket pod and an e-cannon that's fine. But you can only have one or other of them with you on the mission.<br/><br/>*I used this last bit in their most recent mission - upon recovering a crate from a crashed shuttle, someone had to carry it. That lucky someone suffered combat/non-combat penalties for doing so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178265/#Comment_178265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T03:07:11+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  3:07AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I limit everyone to three weapon slots plus unarmed, since this is what's on the original character sheet, and I thought it was by design, but it seems to work ok in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178275/#Comment_178275" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T04:56:35+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  4:56AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Willow, that's a good idea.<br/><br/>Generally the key is finding out what their deafult weapon is, since it then takes an NFA roll to change to another one in combat. And the GM can choose a range that shafts the PC as much as possible given the chance. Maybe the troopers have an ElectroMule that carries their spare gear and weapons, following them a short distance behind?<br/><br/>When people start improving weapons they might end up with a bag full of weapons. That's not a problem, just think of them like golf-clubs, and their golf-bag has anti-gravity suspensors on it. But you can only have one club in your hand at any one time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178289/#Comment_178289" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T06:35:59+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  6:35AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always just figured that the armor was powered, so they didn't have to worry about how heavy things were. Bulky, sure.. But I kinda like the image of a trooper bristling with weaponry. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, I also always figured their weapons were more compact than our versions. I'm thinking rockets like in Starship Troopers, not like modern RPG launchers that are massive and bulky. I figure grenades are about 2 inches long by about an inch wide, but still pack the same or greater punch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
