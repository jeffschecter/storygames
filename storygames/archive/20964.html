I'm not making a criticism of House of Reeds so much as talking about a disappointing session. I haven't played the game enough to know definitively what I think about it; so please take that into consideration, even if the language I use seems to suggest criticism. My group did have some opinions about HoR and express what they believe to be some problems with the game, and I am going to discuss the problems that they thought the game presented. But I personally would like to drill down further myself, being that the game was likely just a bad fit for the personalities that showed up that night. <br/><br/>Disappointing sessions have been very rare for our group, so I think the group was a bit critical. The group really didn't like that HoR doesn't have much direction or procedures to end the story or to wrap it up properly. The other problem the group discussed was that the game's procedures didn't have enough of the framework to shape the game meaningfully. The group felt that  The procedures were less influential to the  shaping of the story than one would think; one member said that it was akin to playing completely free-form and just making up a story; I feel that that's an exaggeration-- but he was probably just a bit frustrated. They especially didn't like that there were not many procedures to help players get involved in other players story threads; that is, to help weave the individual player's stories threads together to satisfying conclusion. I pointed out that we could've made more of an effort to weave our stories threads together ourselves. Still, the group felt as though the game went all over the place and it was difficult to have a unifying conclusion. I think the players we played with are more or less extroverts and most typically like to contribute to the story quite a bit, and so that was definitely part of the issue. I felt that there could've been more effort to support other players ideas. Still, I ultimately agreed that the game doesn't provide too much of a structure or procedures to help direct the story toward the end of play, which may not be a bad thing, but didn't fit the group of people that showed up that week. We played with the alternative rule where time passes by the month rather than the year; I don't know if this had an effect on play. The game did produce very creative and fertile ideas, there was just a problem tying these ideas together creating a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>What has been your experience playing the game? Were things discussed above an issue for you?  Any advice to overcome this issue?  I'm thinking about playing with another group of players and saying that it is important that we make an especially conscious effort to share the story and build upon others ideas. Also, I would likely suggest to the group that we consciously strive toward a satisfying ending.

OK, this sounds pretty wanky, but it's kind of designed *not* to have a satisfying ending. The thing it was primarily inspired by, Aaron Reed's <a href="http://18cadence.textories.com/" rel="nofollow">18 Cadence</a>, is all about loss and distance, people who can't hold together, people whose stories you only catch a small part of. Anticlimax, lack of closure. You're meant to end with a nagging, unsatisfied feeling, a sense of loss. (Which is not a narrative mood that works for everybody!)<br/><br/>I totally agree that HoR is a structure-light, prompt-driven kind of game, and I often have the same kind of frustrations with structure-light games, so I can't really object there.<br/><br/>Did your players end up mostly doing story threads with the characters they had created themselves?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460054/#Comment_460054" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-08T05:13:25+00:00" title="February  8, 2017  5:13AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2017 5:44AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>House of Reeds is...

The story was super interesting and creative it just kind of went in too many directions...I know that Ben Robbins and others I highly respect have played your game and enjoyed it a lot\u2026 What do you think I should do differently next time I play?

That sets up really different expectations about the kinds of story you can tell. <br/><br/>In general, the plot points that work best in HoR aren't the kind of high-pressure, action-to-action, demands-a-response stuff that drives the plot of games like Fiasco. A good Fiasco plot point is like a raccoon that got into your kitchen - it's actively causing more and more of a mess, and someone's going to have to grab a broom and try to deal with it. A good HoR plot point is more like, here's the new normal. "My father's been kidnapped and we need to find a way to pay the ransom!" -  not really going to work. "My father's been taken away by the authorities and we may never see him again"  - much better. <br/><br/>The other thing is that it's not really a super-flexible game when it comes to basic themes; it's always talking about stuff like, what counts as a family? How does a home shape its inhabitants, and vice versa? How do these characters work, or fail to work, as a family? Can they remain a family in the face of external pressure and internal conflict, or do things fall apart? That's going to be the stuff that matters regardless of your setting or the tone cards you choose. And if you find yourself wanting to tell a story that's not really about that - which sometimes just kind of happens as stories develop, it's not necessarily anyone's fault - then the system probably won't support it too well. I can totally imagine setting up a game and getting an hour and a half in and realising "crap, we didn't end up making a family and a home, we ended up making key players in an institution.

I think the bad session was completely on us and had nothing to do with the game. We should have paid much closer attention to the instructions...the game is definitely designed to do what it is supposed to do and we just didn't do that\u2026I'm very excited to play another session and  super appreciate tsawac and you giving me pointers for next time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460074/#Comment_460074" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T05:04:56+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  5:04AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2017 5:06AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
