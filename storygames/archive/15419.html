So I'm not in the sweet spot for participation.<br/><br/>As always, my stance is one of "If you've got a cool idea for a game, or need one piece of feedback or whatever, feel free to share it here in the 'Game Design' category. And if you are ready for playtest, absolutely start a thread here! ...But if you want to publicly discuss over several threads (or one very long thread over a long period of time) a game you're building from the ground up, please do it there."<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349813/#Comment_349813" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T12:18:35+00:00" title="November 28, 2011 12:18PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did post in Praxis for a while, and tried to steer people there, but it never got a critical mass so I stopped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349816/#Comment_349816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T12:28:46+00:00" title="November 28, 2011 12:28PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that Praxis exists every couple of months, go there, glance to see if something is interesting and the go elsewhere.<br/><br/>When discussing game design, I find conversation with friends or gamer acquaintances to be far more effective than anything you get on a forum.

I also had high hopes when Ron switched The Forge into the winter phase, and I thought there was some interesting stuff happening during the Ronnies, but it seems to have mostly drifted back to what it's been for a while. I think it would be cool if there was a place online to talk about design stuff with people who are interested in the kind of games I'm interested in, but there don't seem to be enough other people who want the same thing to make it workable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349824/#Comment_349824" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T13:31:07+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  1:31PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2011 1:34PM by Hans_c-o.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I did post in Praxis for a while, and tried to steer people there, but it never got a critical mass so I stopped.</blockquote>\nMe, too.

There should be a really great place for design discussions these days, but there isn't, at least as far as I know.  Praxis could potentially be such a place, but there are few incentives to check-in regularly.  Honestly, in my experience, high-traffic isn't what you want in a design discussion and neither is high visibility.  What you want is high visibility from a specific group of constructive and supportive people.  Blogs, I think, are still the best way to go, but it's difficult if you don't already have a decent following, which is something you have to build up over years.  Some folks have had success with local or regional forums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349862/#Comment_349862" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T16:05:10+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  4:05PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Follow up question, if not Praxis, where do you go to talk about your game design ideas?</blockquote>\nI like Google+ for game discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349864/#Comment_349864" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T16:07:02+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  4:07PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Follow up question, if not Praxis, where do you go to talk about your game design ideas?</blockquote>\nIM, weirdly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349875/#Comment_349875" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-28T17:02:09+00:00" title="November 28, 2011  5:02PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that the biggest hurdle of game design is not so much the design aspect, but of trying to get a playtest going to see if the design actually works.

The traffic is already so high, even among just the limited number of people I'd want to follow, that it's too much to keep up with.  If I was involved in stuff there, it would be just through making a circle of like 10 people, which doesn't feel like the best way to conduct discussions on broader issues, though it might work for designing a specific game.<br/><br/>Honestly, the best conversations I have are still always face-to-face over beers, when I happen to see Sage or John or Jackson or Lukas or Jamie in Seattle.  Or, lately, they've been happening through collaborative projects I'm working on with folks -- They Became Flesh or Stage One -- where we have a reason and commitment to working and talking with each other about games.<br/><br/>I wish I had the time to run a hardcore game design discussion thing year-round, but Game Chef is the place I give back to the community right now and I'm not sure I can take on something else.  I mean, I can imaging running the Game Chef blog as a more active thing, maybe, to talk about best practices for game design and start some discussion in the comments, maybe to engage in ongoing discussions about Game Chef alumni games that are moving forward in development, but that would mainly be using the tools already in place, not starting something new.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350380/#Comment_350380" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-03T10:17:04+00:00" title="December  3, 2011 10:17AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What would make G+ even better is if it allowed an easier way to create and maintain shared circles dedicated to specific topics. This way you could follow specific people and specific topics without a lot of work. Throw in the current ability to mute posts (if a topic doesn't interest you, especially one that keeps getting comments, you can hide it) and it could eventually be an ok system for tuning out noise, saving time, and focusing on what you want. Much better than forums and blogs.<br/><br/>I agree that in person interactions are extremely valuable. I have a small army of local friends to turn to for those needs and it's invaluable. But I enjoy reaching out to friends who live all over the world. G+ Hangouts (their video conferencing) could make this happen, giving you the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>But I don't think G+ is quite there yet. But it could get there! <br/><br/>Right now I could create my own circle for my friends who are interested in cooking instead of RPGs. I would much rather a system where I could tag posts "cooking" and you could add those specific posts to your cooking circles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350406/#Comment_350406" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-03T19:21:33+00:00" title="December  3, 2011  7:21PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I check there occasionally, but don't post there.

The most benefit I ever got from a forum was from Joshua A.C. Newman's <i>Game Designer Studio</i>, where there were specific expectations about how you'd use the process. I'd like to see more people attempt something like that, or possibly something analogous to an online writers' group where designers read each others texts and give each other honest reactions. A while back on Praxis I tried some "be the change you want to see" stuff where I tried to give in-depth attention to as many games as I could, but it gets tiring being the only person doing that, especially when it turns out that a lot of people aren't actually serious about developing their games further.<br/><br/>I also think the big missing link in the design community is a way for similarly situated designers to find and interact with each other so that they can have deeper conversations, even if they don't happen via forums. The biggest benefit I ever got from Praxis was finding some other designers who were willing to Skype with me so we could playtest each others' games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
