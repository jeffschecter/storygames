And if Christmas doesn't do anything for you, I hope you still enjoy the playbook.<br/><br/>The Reverent is a skin for a special teenager who has a powerful connection to the Almighty and can channel holy power to protect the damned and condemn the innocent. Ooops, I meant that the other way around. I'm a little worried about overlap with The Angel but I think it's different enough to work alongside it. This is still VERY much in an experimental state and feedback and comments would be very much appreciated. I am happy to modify or add to what I have here to better suit everyone's vision. So without further delay, here it is...<br/><br/>The Reverent<br/><br/>Stats<br/>Add 1 to one of these:<br/><br/>Hot 1, Cold 1, Volatile -1, Dark -1<br/><br/>Reverent Moves (Choose 2)<br/><br/>Martyr<br/>When you take harm because you were trying to help or protect someone, mark experience and take a String on whoever you were helping or protecting.<br/><br/>Eye For An Eye<br/>If someone gives you a condition, give them a condition in return. If you already going to give them a condition, take 1 forward against them instead.<br/><br/>Irreproachable<br/>When another PC tries to turn you on or shut you down, you may spend a String to have their roll be shifted one category lower. (10 up is 7-9, 7-9 is a miss)<br/><br/>Stigmata<br/>When someone inflicts harm in your presence, you may spend a String on them to have them take the harm as well.<br/><br/>Guide My Hand<br/>Whenever someone you have Strings with is in trouble (your call), you may spend a String you have with them to have you already be there, with or without any clear explanation why.<br/><br/>Sanctuary<br/>Whenever you consecrate a safe place for another, if they spend a night there with you, both of you may remove a condition. <br/><br/>Your Backstory<br/>\u2022 You watch everyone, practically unnoticed, waiting for them to slip up. Gain a String on everyone. <br/>\u2022 Someone knows your greatest sin. They gain 2 Strings on you.<br/><br/>Sex Move<br/>When you deny someone sexually, gain the condition 'tempted' and take a String on them. When you have sex with someone, you lose all your Strings on them and remove a condition.<br/><br/>Darkest Self<br/>The judgement of the King of Heaven is upon them all! You see sin and corruption all around you and it\u2019s your divine mission to stamp it out, to burn the wicked and cast down the dirty whores. No longer will they laugh at you or put you down for your beliefs, now is the time to show them what true power is. You\u2019ll create a hell on earth to save their miserable souls, whether they want it or not. You escape your darkest self when you repent and someone forgives you of your wrongdoings.<br/><br/>Advancement<br/>Take another Reverent move.<br/>Take another Reverent move.<br/>Take a move from another Skin.<br/>Take a move from another Skin.<br/>Join a Bible Study Group<br/>\x81Add 1 to Hot (max 3).<br/>\x81Add 1 to Cold (max 3).<br/>\x81Add 1 to Volatile (max 3).<br/>\x81Add 1 to Dark (max 3).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401740/#Comment_401740" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T04:26:21+00:00" title="December 26, 2012  4:26AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think perhaps they need a move about gaining strings, seeing as otherwise their primary methods are getting people all hot and bothered and being violent.

At least with vampires and werewolves, you know when you finish playing you won't actually have to meet them in real life! Ha! No but seriously, TildeSee's suggestion is good.<br/><br/>Maybe for Martyr, you get and string on them <i>and</i> mark xp? Also, I like the "equality" in Eye for an Eye, maybe if you give them a condition, you both take a string on each other? (2 conditions, 2 strings) So, adding effects, as opposed to just replacing their effects with gaining strings.<br/><br/>For Shield of Faith, you can already spend a string to make somebody have to hold steady, right? So maybe if they try to harm you, you get a string on them? (and you could use it right away, of course?) That would broaden the move's utility a bit, and I feel like that would be a really nice combo with Guide My Hand: the bullies victimize you, and then you spend your strings on them to show up when their in trouble so you can judge them and moralize! That would fall afoul of the singletone rule, though, so you could only use it for a string once per scene... maybe a choice of either?<br/><br/>(Also, and this is a small thing, but you're capitalizing all the words in the move names. There are different schools of practice on that, but if you want the same format pretty much that Joe uses in the books, go with Eye for an Eye, Shield of Faith, Wrath of God, and probably Bless this House.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401748/#Comment_401748" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T07:30:20+00:00" title="December 26, 2012  7:30AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2012 7:31AM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gang advanced move.<br/><br/>As for the sex move:<br/>Spurning someone should gain you a string.

They don't understand that blessed grace and holy charisma that make your soul a firebrand. They don't have the humility to commit themselves to anything beyond their petty wants. That's okay, you'll show them. You'll preach to whoever'll listen and save their little souls whether they want it or not. <br/><br/>Your commitments wouldn't be meaningful without the temptations of the flesh and vice. Your body screams at you to betray your sacred promises. Your friends turn away from the righteous path. Your faith gives you strength but it's not always easy to stand up for what's right. It's so hard to be strong one all the time. Something's gotta give. <br/><br/>We all need forgiveness for something, right? <br/><br/>I'd have made the Stats like this:<br/>Hot 1, Cold -1, Volatile 1, Dark -1. <br/><br/>It's not a temptation if your no good at it anyways. Also, I\u2019ve spent more than a few summers at bible camp. It's hot and volatile. Also, I'm mean like that. <br/><br/>So, five out of six of the moves are harm related. <br/><br/><b>Martyr</b> is fine, a bit boring but fine.<br/><br/><b>Eye for an Eye:</b> If someone gives you a condition or deals you harm, give them a condition. If you already going to give them a condition, take 1 forward instead. <br/><br/><b>Shield of Faith</b> should do something totally different. <br/><br/>Maybe like this: <br/><br/><b>Irreproachable</b>: <br/>When another PC tries to turn you on or shut you down, you may spend a string to have their roll be shifted one category lower. <br/><br/><del>Bless this House</del> <b>Sanctuary</b><br/>Whenever you consecrate a safe place for another, if they spend a night there with you, both of you may remove a condition. <br/><br/><b>Purity Ring</b><br/>Whenever you publicly and ritually indulge your virtues and make a show of you faith, make a promise to your Higher Power, and write it down. Until you violate that promise (or the end of the session), you may take advantage of your own Conditions. Whoever witnesses you violate any of your accumulated promises, gains a string on you. <br/><br/><b>Sex Move</b><br/><br/>This should be a pretty big deal. Like, marking XP isn't all that tempting. <br/><br/>When you deny someone sexually, gain the condition 'tempted' and take a string on them.<br/>When you have sex with someone, you both lose all your string on each other.<br/>Lost the condition 'tempted' and gain the condition 'guilty'<br/><br/>As for the <b>Darkest Self:</b><br/>You should escape it only when someone forgives you for your own bullshit.<br/><br/>Also, you (hopefully) grow out of your self-righteousness not into it. That season advance should be 'make someone feel beautiful.'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401752/#Comment_401752" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T08:52:36+00:00" title="December 26, 2012  8:52AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> : Youth groups ain't nothing to fuck with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401753/#Comment_401753" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T09:20:55+00:00" title="December 26, 2012  9:20AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2012 9:22AM by Pheylorn.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow! Ok that is a lot of input to digest and consider. Here's some thoughts to sound board off of.<br/><br/>Martyr<br/>When you take harm because you were trying to help or protect someone, mark experience and take a String on whoever you were helping or protecting.<br/><br/>Eye for an Eye (I like Orlando's version better, cleaner and just as engaging.)<br/>If someone gives you a condition or deals you harm, give them a condition. If you already going to give them a condition, take 1 forward instead.<br/><br/>Shield of Faith (Jonhstone has a good point about the holding steady being a use of a String and so granting to a String instead just makes sense, so how's this version? I love the idea how Johnstone hightlighted the scenario of being bullied and then using Guide My Hand to be there to judge and condemn them, so perfect!)<br/>When someone attempts to harm you, take a String on them.<br/><br/>The Gang advance "join a bible study group" was in the initial draft but I replaced it with the special season advance. If I added it back in, what should I replace it with?<br/><br/>As for the Sex Move, I like where Orlando has taken it in his example but I still feel the Reverent should pay a higher price for going down this route, but still get something out of it, and that their partner shouldn't be too burdened by it. So how's this?<br/>When you deny someone sexually, gain the condition 'tempted' and take a String on them. When you have sex with someone, you lose all your Strings them and remove a condition.<br/><br/>I like Orlando's Sanctuary move better than Bless This House. It's smoother and encourages two people to spend a night together, that's what we want, right? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Sanctuary<br/>Whenever you consecrate a safe place for another, if they spend a night there with you, both of you may remove a condition.<br/><br/>As for the stat choices you put forth Orlando, I don't think I agree. The Reverent is all about being Cold; judging others, gaining resolve from their faith in frightening situations and is very meta, and Dark is the meta stat to me. Anyone else want to weigh in on that though? I'm not married to anything yet. (no pun intended)<br/><br/>As for the capitalization on the Moves, this is in fact a big deal to me, I will be correcting that I assure you! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401754/#Comment_401754" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T10:01:39+00:00" title="December 26, 2012 10:01AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2012 10:02AM by Johnstone.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cold is a must stat for this skin. Evangelism is all about shutting people down. I could see Hot instead of Dark maybe, depends on what you're going for. You know the old campus ploy where some pretty girl approaches you and invites you to a party and you're like "right on" but then you go to it and it's actually Bible study and you're like "fuuuuuuuuu." That's turning you on then shutting you down hardcore. If you go with Dark the strings can make up for that Hot-1, but I kinda feel like this skin isn't quite sinister enough to be Cold+Dark, y'know?<br/><br/>Also, I kinda feel like they should have to wait to call people on their shit like everybody else. I think it's emergent that players will want that move because they will be trying to do exactly that a whole hell of a lot in the game, but struggling to do it right because just like everybody else, the Reverent is too caught up in her own stupid bullshit to grow the fuck up. So I think your original choice of bible study was the right one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401755/#Comment_401755" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T10:04:52+00:00" title="December 26, 2012 10:04AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'd settle for Hot &amp; Cold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401756/#Comment_401756" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T10:17:07+00:00" title="December 26, 2012 10:17AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Hot &amp; Cold, too, even though Volatile and Dark can definitely have a place for this Skin.

Just being good at the expected stuff, or doubleplus good at it, isn't usually that interesting for me. Like, I was trying to figure out a 'pray' move, but it's already a basic one. And not having a direct or reliable line to God is important for this character so that the GM lets them make their own decisions. Instead of like, "I ASKED JESUS. HE SAID IT WAS COOL."<br/><br/>Faith doesn't really mean anything if you can just reliably call God up to chat. <br/><br/>Evanglists are reliable social manipulators, when they're violent or oracular it's chaotic and difficult.<br/><br/>Also, player psychology being what it is, they'll try to use the best stats all the time, and be wary of using their worst stats, even if the probabilities aren't that different.<br/><br/>(That being said, I have this bit of dialog in my head now, where the scene is like that one in Jennifer's Body where Needy is about to stab Jen, and Jen's like "I thought murder was a mortal sin." and Needy is like "NAH I ASKED JESUS.

I'm saved!") until they shed it.  <br/><br/>Once they shed the Condition, there's an opportunity for a great scene with the Reverent character who wants to know why they haven't been to Bible Study lately, and tears flow freely on all sides.

That might be a better fit than Stigmata. Although, makes the Reverent a bit of medic/cleric. Which I'm okay with because I think it fits with the 'come to me for salvation' bit. I think all harm is a bit potent, maybe just one harm. Because then you can drag their ass off to bed to get the other two points.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about this one. I really want a move for purity rings, but I'm not sure if I've thought of a good one yet. Because as it stands, there's no mechanical advantage to being chaste. <br/><br/>Oh, and can we take out the bit about whores in the Darkest Self? I know this about biblical judgement but some of my friends are sex-workers, and this context, I'm not sure it's the best use of language. I'd be happy with 'sinners' or 'filth' or 'vermin'.<br/><br/>Also, sorry to be nitpicky, can we change Bible Study to Youth Group or Youth Ministry. And, Breath of God to Lay on Hands? And King of Heaven to the Divine? Mostly, because, while the Christian theme of this playbook is obvious and strong, I'd like to be able to easy have this playbook be for non-Christian characters too. So that you could play a Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist or Sikh Reverent with relative ease.

It's a Christian playbook. I don't really want to move away from that into something multi-faith (despite the fact that Christianity is basically multi-faith internally). It's just that if there are equally good terms that are in the Christian vernacular but are also somewhat ambivalent or easy to re-colour, I'd prefer that. Having our cake and eating if we can. And also, it's just a suggestion, we can keep the Reverent more explicitly Christian. It was just a thought that occurred to me.<br/><br/>As for the Purity Ring move, I'm still thinking on that. Calling it Vows or something similar works too. I don't have a good move for it yet, so I'm not too worried.<br/><br/>On the Offence thing. It's less about offending anyone and more about keeping with the generally sex-positive and queer tone of Monsterhearts. I think singling out whores in the Darkest Self focuses too much on one kind of sin, whereas there is a whole panoply of vice and wickedness for the Reverent to get all high and mighty about.
