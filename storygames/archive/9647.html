It clocks in at 8 pages of uncluttered text, and it combines my favourite bits of hack-and-slashery with things I'm really into (specifically "say yes or roll" and explicit player narrative control). It has had exactly zero playtesting and has been read by exactly one person besides myself.<br/><br/>Here it is: <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dc9j5kb4_37ggdgmhd7" rel="nofollow">The Super-Easy Adventure RPG</a>.<br/><br/>Enjoy!

They are only in there because I wrote this game for a guy who likes them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>If agile is only going to be used for sneaking,stealing, and climbing (also known as sneaking sneaking and sneaking or more appropiately theivin theivin and theivin) why not just call it thieven in the first place.

It would also be used for doing backflips, scooping a weapon out of someone's hand, dancing... anything that an Agile person would be good at. The reason those stats are what they are is because I wanted to be able to describe my favourite Sword and Sorcery characters: Conan, Grey Mouser... well, OK, maybe Wise is a bit out of place in those contexts, but if you add in characters from High Fantasy like Gandalf, well, then you need Wise.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Why do we need preists vs wizard and why do we need dedication vs wise again?</blockquote>\nWe have priests and wizards because D&amp;D had them, yes. Also because I wanted there to be a 4x4 grid system for determining special abilities, instead of 4x3. I think that special ability will definitely make them play differently over time as wizards do Spells and Priests recover stat damage. Wise and Dedicated are totally different things.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>Third, ability damage sucks its leads to one very prominate problem (death spiral)  and effectively means you need to keep track of 5 piles of hps lameo.</blockquote>\nAbility points in this case track up and down all the time. In fact, they are meant to be that way. By tying levelling-up to stats and then causing stats to be damaged when you fail rolls, but only allowing players to gain experience when they fail, it forces players to prioritize which stats they want to be good at. It forces them, basically, to focus on one stat at a time if they ever want to level up, protecting that stat against damage while lowering the other ones. I didn't use a hitpoint system because I a) wanted damage to be cinematic only; and b) wanted to force PCs with damaged stats to seek out adventures that would test their bad stats (to earn ticks and get those stats back up, a la PDQ).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>I would stick with a dedicated roll under system and maybe something a bit more imaginative than rerolls for burning stats to help compensate</blockquote>\nI HATE roll-under. Too counterintuitive. But if you'll note: with stats that range 1-6, rolling d6 + stat, hit 8 or better is exactly the same, mechanically, as roll-under, but without 1 being good at 6 bad.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>dm likes you succeed</blockquote>\nI hope the GM has more sense than to play favourites like that, but that's always a risk.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>For the love of crap dont make me remember another useless acronom (AM) because you think your game is special</blockquote>\nI made up a new term for GM with my tongue firmly in my cheek. I actually started with DM as an abbreviation for Dice Master, and then thought "Nah, hell with it. Come up with something new and cute and stupid. Nobody is going to use it anyway". I'm not asking you to remember anything. Hell, even when I told my girlfriend about it I said "GM" not "AM".
