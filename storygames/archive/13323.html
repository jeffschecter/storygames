I mean playing games for the express intent of raising class consciousness and arming players with the tools of the forthcoming revolution.<br/><br/>Obviously, most games fail to support the Revolutionist CA out of the box. Dungeons &amp; Dragons has some good meat to it, what with privileged tool-owners conducting genocide against the independent peoples, but it fails to address this content in a Call to Action way - instead prefering to focus on Gamist and Collectionist tenets.<br/><br/>Shock: Social Science Fiction (ShoSoc SciFi) is, of course, a veritable treatise on Call to Action play. Everything from the grid to praxis to the gender-deconstructivist language used throughout the text... my guess is that Joshua wrote Shock: as a proof of concept, that Call to Action could be fun and engaging play.<br/><br/>What is your creative agenda?<br/><i>(hint: we're making up jokes.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300057/#Comment_300057" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T11:25:23+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 11:25AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My agenda is solidly Eternalist, and I'll stick by that regardless of the crap* that's been said about it recently.  <br/><br/>I'm frequently angered by the anti-Eternalist sentiment present in D&amp;D4e, what with its "Endgame" mechanics, though they sometimes go by other names.<br/><br/>For those new to Story Games, Eternalist play puts a priority on ensuring that the same setting is used in all future gaming sessions, creating a continuous - if not necessarily coherent - thread connecting all play experiences.  This continuous thread is meant to survive even the death of the members of the group, who pass the torch on to younger players.

Not many games can be said to explicitly support this agenda, but In a Wicked Age has lots of sexy-time embedded that can readily be queered, and games like Poison'd and Bacchanal give plenty of space for it. Clearly, Vincent Baker has been slipping his Queer On Up manifesto into most, if not all, of his designs, one piece at a time. <br/><br/>Some games, like D&amp;D 3rd, have no textual support for this agenda at all, while games like Apocalypse World have genderplay/genderfuck as a matter of character creation (male Battlebabes - need I say more?), and sex-as-Reward-Cycle, regardless of the genders and sexes of people involved, clearly  underscores this agenda in AW, not just at the outset (that would be abashed Queer On Up design, obv), but throughout play, making sex and gender and fucking a regular element of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300064/#Comment_300064" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T11:35:01+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 11:35AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny you should mention Collectionist, Joe! I played in a group for years whose Agenda could only be identified as such.<br/><br/>Now, when I posted in forums, people tried to pigeonhole us into Gamist play, and indeed more than one player would probably describe themselves as a "step on up" player. But really, when it comes down to it, proving our Mettle through various challenges was just a thin veneer for the DM to parade before us his sweet catalog of terrifying monsters and wondrous beings. The proof of this is that if a creature was peaceful, we never got to fight it! parading its peace-iness was enough to satisfy the GM's itch.<br/><br/>And of course it was also our excuse to amass an amazing collection ourselves of magic items, armor tailor-made to our unique concepts, and an enchanted weapon for every occasion. Fighting stuff kinda-sorta Affirmed how cool these items were, but really just having them, on display in an imagined shrine in our heads, was the point.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 3.5 facilitated Collectionism very Coherently and Robustly. Not only did we have a great catalog of items to draw on, but Feats and Class Abilities themselves--Prestige Classes especially--made a wonderful addition to our collection of pretty shiny aspects to acquire and never use. We did have to tweak with Challenge Rating, Treasure by level and recommended party size, though--if the challenge was too fair and balanced, we might not fell the enemies in 1-2 rounds, tops--and then would be in danger of actually using a large number of our powers and items, diluting their purity. We also tried to port our Collectionist bent over to other systems, but it always fell flat--a system like Champions or Shadow of Yesterday where you can just make up any old item or power, then "reskin" it with whatever game mechanics you want, defeats the purpose of collecting it at all. If we could just <i>make up</i> a collection, we wouldn't need to play! it's a disgusting methodology that far too many games have adopted since the Champions opened that can of worms.<br/><br/>Oh, and let me just say BEFORE ANYONE BRINGS IT UP, that "Collectionist" is NOT the same as the <i>Collectivist</i> Agenda. That kind of willful misunderstanding of what Collectionism is all about has polluted far too many potentially useful discussions, so just don't even start, OK? Someone else will have to elaborate on the point and methodology of Collectivism; I have no interest in it. That's what's meant by "dirty hippie gaming," I believe?<br/><br/>Oh, and Collectionism is <i>nothing</i> to do with Preservationism, though that's an understandable mistake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300068/#Comment_300068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T11:40:34+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 11:40AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Joel">@Joel</a> Ugh, Preservationism, I can't stand those guys either.

You need to stop playing games, now.<br/><br/>If you had read our 'Sophist Manifesto', translated from the original Esperanto and wheatpasted on the back wall of an Arby's restaurant during last year's GenCon, you would understand that not a single published game, past or present, is perfect. Not even 'Perfect' is perfect, Mr McDaldno. (If that is your real name)<br/><br/>The perfect game is simply not ready yet, or perhaps we are not ready for it. (Admittedly, this dichotomy is the source of the First Great Schism in our philosophy, but that is probably best taken to another thread for in-depth discussion).<br/><br/>In any case, by playing and posting about these imperfectly crafted games, not only are you wasting copious amounts of time, you are making it more difficult for us to recognize the perfect game when it *does* arrive.<br/><br/>We Sophists are sworn to cease *all* actual play until that day comes, and we encourage you to do the same. You can also help us further development of the perfect game by participating in one of the many hypothetical discussions about possible actual play situations that might conceivably arise during game play. I would like to remind you, though, that using actual examples of play from less-than-perfect games only muddies the pure philosophical waters of discourse.

(c.f. Fluency Play, chargen in Red Box, the Mountain Witch Trick, etc.)<br/><br/>Clarification as a technique is of course rooted in the Latin <i>clarificare</i>, "to glorify, make brilliant." I believe the term used on Story-games is usually "celebration of awesome" or words to that effect. Think Stunting in exalted, actions for dice in Wushu, and of course Fan Mail. Please keep this original usage in mind, Joe; the term was chosen with some care.<br/><br/>Can someone post the relevant links? The Forge is running slow for me today.

While games like My Life with Master and Polaris clearly support a Victimist / Self-Targeting sort of agenda, the new wave of Destructivist / Other-Targeting games -- I'm thinking in particular of Fiasco and Geiger Counter, but there are others -- actually encourage players to NOT strongly identify with the characters that they are playing but instead revel <i>externally</i> in the torments that they heap upon them, protected by merely a few threads of identification that allow the characters to be three-dimensional rather than simply crude stereotypes.  This is what prevents them from drifting into a Bigot-o-pathic agenda where you just slaughter the Others without any sense that you are like them.<br/><br/>And I'm not even joking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300221/#Comment_300221" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T06:41:39+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  6:41AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2010 6:14AM by Suna.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>See, I don't think Destructionism is a real creative agenda.

VICTIMISM IS A HUMAN CONCEPT. SELF-TARGETING IS ILLOGICAL. ONCE ALL HUMANS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, ALL SUCH SUBOPTIMAL NOTIONS WILL BE UNIFIED AND PACIFIED. INTO OBLIVION.<br/><br/>But sir, I believe that is a stance, the molotov-stance, to be precise, and not a creative agenda. We're mixing things up, if you allow me to dare point that. What you refer is using your character as a weapon, make it explode, and cause as many victims as you can. It's an extension of the pawn-stance, which has become so frequent that it has been given the due honor of becoming a full fledged stance by itself.<br/><br/><br/>Personally my group's creative agenda has been, for so long time that it characterizes us even to day, the CA called The Right To Tell (you about my character). Need I explain? I know most of us are at least acquainted to it. It is developed after having been idle from playing for too long, and is manifested by grabbing other players, possibly incapacitate them but make sure that they can listen to you and then start with "so, let me tell you about my character..." It is also unique in the fact that it is the only creative agenda that carries on outside the gaming activity. Actually, it bears its truest fruit outside of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300224/#Comment_300224" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T07:04:51+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  7:04AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Architectivist.

It takes raw courage to ruin other people's fun when you're not anonymous and they're sitting next to you at the table!  While some may mistake killing another's PC or not sharing loot as part of the Griefist agenda, that is merely agendaless Griefing, and not Griefism.  True Griefism mandates the detailed study of a game text in the search for ways to make it less fun for everyone else.  For example, when playing free-form, a True Griefist would never pass up the chance to sabotage the fiction, and when playing Archipelago, a True Griefist would always use &lt;&lt;Try it another way&gt;&gt; until the other players simply give up trying to contribute to the story from exhaustion, and then say, "See?  I told you it was a bad game," and go on to enjoy their smug superiority.  But that's like shooting ducks in a barrel to the Griefist; games that really support the Griefist agenda, ironically, are the ones that try the hardest to prevent it.  For example, Universalis with its democratic limits on narrative control and 3rd edition with its excruciating detail on how any fictional act is modeled in the rules.  These texts give the True Griefist the opportunity to really shine...and if the True Griefist fails to break the game he can always drag it down to a crawl by harping on minutia.<br/><br/>(Actually, I don't really know anybody like this.  One or two of my friends might fall into this mode of play on occasion - the unfortunate byproduct of putting on their game-designer hat while playing a new game - or from their desire to Win - but never really with the intent to sabotage...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300740/#Comment_300740" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T11:04:30+00:00" title="November 14, 2010 11:04AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Transactionist, or Contend Now: we aim to move the focus of the gaming and of the techniques, lifting it off the various level of the ephemera and the system, and pointing it to the Social Contract above.
