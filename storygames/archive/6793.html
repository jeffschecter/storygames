This is D&amp;D's Hobby/Club Marketing/Support Division.  If you have played any organized D&amp;D at a convention, then you probably know who they are.  Anyhow, as a part of the RPGA's revamp some years ago, they put together several tests that you had pass in order to be a judge for them.  They are open book and if you have the patience then they are really not that hard (just incredibly annoying.)  <br/><br/>In a fit of nostalgia, I just re-took these tests on the RPGA website to see how much I could remember.  You can see my results on the <a href="http://www.fusionofthought.com/files/ExamResults-Herald.pdf" rel="nofollow">Herald Level</a> and <a href="http://www.fusionofthought.com/files/ExamResults-Master.pdf" rel="nofollow">Master Level</a> tests.  Needless to say I did not pass.  Anyhow, the point of all of this is that these tests have made me feel a WHOLE lot better about 4th edition.  Here is the question from the Master Level test that drove this point home:\n<blockquote>The sorcerer Hennet is casting a summon monster VIII spell defensively when he is struck by a secondary bolt from Ming's maximized chain lightning spell, and unfortunately fails his saving throw. Ming is a 17th-level wizard with a 20 Intelligence. What is the DC of the Concentration check that Hennet must make in order to continue casting his spell?</blockquote>The answer is:  69<br/><br/>Value:     Reason<br/>10           Base for a Concentration Check<br/>8             For the spell level of Summon Monster VIII<br/>51           For the damage from the spell.  Which is 17d6 maximized (102), halved for being in the secondary area of effect.<br/>----<br/>69<br/><br/>Now, if Hennet is able to make this Concentration Check, then for his trouble he can summon a Celestial Whale.  Which I hope that he summons over the head of Ming and drops it on him from a height of about 50'.
