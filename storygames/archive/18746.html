Whereupon we got time-shifted back fifteen minutes, before the scene happened, and all the players but one were told "Nothing happened, you don't remember any of that." The last player was told, "You remember <i>everything</i> about it." Naturally, his character was the one who was trusted the least.<br/><br/>So we played out the same scene again, sort of, only it wasn't to make that one scene perfect...instead, it was to do that fun time-travel thing where one person knows the future and has to convince everyone else to do what he says, exactly as he says, even though the only explanation he has is the idiotic-sounding "Because I know the future." We got a lot of great stuff out of it: PCs were revealing secrets on their deathbeds so that the character who remembered everything would have something to use against them in the next iteration, everyone got to try crazy schemes without fear of permanent death, that one player got to roleplay becoming increasingly desperate and agitated and quoting everyone else's lines back at them before they even said it, it was awesome. After two or three iterations, the problem was solved and we moved on, but it was a high point of the game that we still talk about years later.<br/><br/>So a soft reset for a scene can definitely be a good thing, and won't even beat up your game's continuity too much if the genre will support it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420654/#Comment_420654" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-24T04:53:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2013  4:53AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2013 4:54AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are there any games that do this?</blockquote>\nReplaying scenes over and over is the primary structural conceit of <i>My Daughter, the Queen of France</i>, where it mimics both the process of rehearsing a play (for the players) and the obsessive recapitulation of important/traumatic memories (for Shakespeare.) \n<blockquote>I can think of several reasons why, even if it was part of game mechanics, players wouldn't use it.

Even if you are passing that judgment primarily on yourself, it is going to spill over to your fellow players. A game that offers this as an explicit option may help a little bit, but I doubt it would overcome that obstacle except in groups who already have a culture of (constructive) self-criticism and mid-play analysis. This is also my experience with Archipelago, though of course the effect is diminished when you're only asking to redo a specific contribution, rather than the whole scene.<br/><br/>I don't think you need to worry about boring. If the scene itself is that boring, nobody is going to suggest replaying it.\n<blockquote>But equally, I was playing around with different rulesets for GM-less MH and repeated the same scene a few times and it went from so-so to awesome in just a couple of attempts.</blockquote>\nYes, exactly. Part of what appealed to me about introducing scene repetition in MDtQoF was seeing if it would help groups consciously improve upon their play in ways they might otherwise consider impossible or difficult. Having several opportunities to play through a scene also gives players freedom to experiment as widely or wildly as they like, because there's no danger of causing permanent 'damage.'<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420660/#Comment_420660" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-24T08:30:17+00:00" title="August 24, 2013  8:30AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2013 9:44AM by Rickard.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can think of several reasons why, even if it was part of game mechanics, players wouldn't use it. We're fundamentally trying to get through an experience,</blockquote>\nThe only reason I can think of it that it breaks the immersion of being in a story, or in character. I call that bull. Sure, I can understand that thinking, but that's a thinking that's only taking their side of how to play a roleplaying game. If you want to play to create a great story together (setting any kind of immersion aside), you should use a structure like this. We are not perfect and mistakes can happen, often by having hidden agendas, by misunderstanding, or by an exaggerated response on something that another participant made, only because it was such a surprise for the first person.<br/><br/>I've been in GM-less games where my character's or my own goal has been destroyed, leaving my experience stranded. I had my options cut down in a not pleasing way. I've seen side stories taking a turn and leaving the genre all together. We are really good at saying "This should not happen my character" but we're not that good in saying "This should not happen to my gaming experience", and then tell <i>why</i> it's bad and have a discussion about it, so make everybody can share the same vision. [edit] Perhaps the the person believing it's play experience was ruined just understood things wrong?<br/><br/>The game should make everybody share the same vision of how to play the game at the beginning of the session, but there is not harm to constantly remind the group of this. Playing a scene again can make a lot of stuff appear that wasn't there the first time it got played, possibly even tie in other participant's agendas to make more people benefit from that scene.<br/><br/>But this is just theory from my side. It's thoughts that I got these last few months. Something you can read between the lines is that you also need perfect information if you want to concentrate on creating a story, GM-less or not, so everybody are more clear of what's going on and can more easily adapt to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420661/#Comment_420661" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-24T08:59:30+00:00" title="August 24, 2013  8:59AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2013 8:59AM by vulpinoid.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been a part of a live-action game where reboots were common.

Interestingly, Wushu Open would work really well for an "unreliable flashback" sort of story; players' details are expected to conflict, but their rolls establish the truth of their claims.<br/><br/>Of course, the idea of making a Football game just tempts me to use Apocalypse World.

I'll post a more considered response in a bit, but for now I'll say yes I think it's a good idea in theory but needs careful handling, and you need to have everybody on board with it (I suspect a lot of folks are going to be queasy about the idea, for many of the reasons cited above). I think the best way to do it would be not by having it as a general GMing tool, but as the very cornerstone of a game. Forex, you have a game called something like Kharma Nirvana, which you 'win' by continually reliving your life until you get various key aspects of it 'right', i.e. a game version of (and I'm very surprised no-one's mentioned this before) Groundhog Day.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
