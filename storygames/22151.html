                    (blorb kinda means "the prep for the game is fundamental, improvising is what you do only when your prep has failed you and hopefully you don't have to do it, also prep things not events". If we have a nice canonical description give it to me so I can link it thanks.)<br/><br/>Here are a couple scenarios that my inner <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> didn't know how to evaluate.<br/><br/>(a) Prep says "under the cloth is a cursed mirror which [does bad thing upon looking in it], but it's also really old and the curse may have lost its efficacy. Roll 1d6 and on a 6 the mirror is just a mirror". Players feel under the cloth, feel glass, assume it's a cursed mirror, take it with them, show it to an enemy, GM rolls a 5, enemy gets [bad'd].<br/><br/>(b) Same as above, but GM rolls upon entering the mirror room and knows it's a 5 the whole time the players have it with them covered.<br/><br/>(c) Prep says "it's either a cursed mirror or a steel plate with [info] painted onto it. When the players do something that would tell the difference, roll 1d6 and if it's a 6 then it's the steel plate. Please describe it in such a way that it's ambiguous as long as plausible, for example if they just reach under the cloth and feel it rather than looking."<br/><br/>(d) Same as (b), but prep says "GM, identify the character or characters with approximately a 1/6 chance to be the first to interact with the mirror. If multiple, choose between them randomly. Write this character down. If that character is indeed the first to interact with the mirror, it is not cursed."<br/><br/>(e) Same as (c) but with the which-character-first-interacts mechanics.<br/><br/>How blorby do those feel? Completely blorby? Compromised in some way?                </div>

                            D and E are right out. It can't be "contingent" like that. That is unblorb.<br/><br/>B seems least bad.<br/><br/>To be honest I think I do some A &amp; C stuff.<br/><br/>Rolling to see if doors are locked in <i>In Search of the Unknown</i> as the characters get close to the door, "enter the room" as it where. Which is B.<br/><br/>Tier 1 truths just are blorbier to me than tier 2. More satisfying as a player. Tier 2 and tier 3 are more fun as a DM and ofc it's very difficult to do all tier 1 prepping an entire world. The fallback system solve the problem of our conflicting desire to prep widely <i>and</i> deeply. Tier 2 also makes sense for things that really are "alive"; i.e. other people going around in the dungeon locking &amp; unlocking doors.                        </div>

                            The first three seem totally fine to me, but (d) and (e) are quite interesting. I think a great deal would depend on the motives behind this mechanic. Why is it put together the way it is? What do we know about the characters or the players before we make the determination? <br/><br/>(Figuring out what “interact with it” means could be tricky, too - what if two characters touch or see it at the same time? What if it’s the toad monster? - but that’s not as important a detail in terms of this thought experiment, I suppose.)                        </div>

I really love that you put in a diegetic explanation for A, B &amp; C. Going the extra mile♥<br/><br/>The module that had the orig "mirror story" also has tons and tons of "runic tables" that are randomly cursed or not cursed. The equiv of "this dungeon has a lot of mirrors, ⅚ of them are cursed, roll randomly each time". Prepping widely &amp; disclaiming decision-making. It's a tier 2!                        </div>

You have put this well.<br/><br/>I think what I'm trying to call out here, what my brain was pinging me about, is that blorb is not just about the effects which occur, but also about <i>counterfactuals</i>. If the prep says "on a 6 it is uncursed, unless you are playing with exactly 6 player characters, in which case choose one randomly beforehand and if it is quite clear that they are the first to interact with the mirror then it is uncursed otherwise roll", then there is no way for the players to distinguish between that prep and just "on a 6 it's uncursed". Literally impossible to distinguish if the GM does their job well.<br/><br/>And yet.<br/><br/>In one scenario, a character could say "if only I was the one to examine the mirror, it would be uncursed!" and be right (even though they could not know they were right) but their rightness in some sense <i>makes no sense</i>, and in the other they could not say that and be right.<br/><br/>And to me, it feels like the truth of an undiagetic counterfactual undermines blorb!<br/><br/>Whereas consider instead a mirror whose prep said "the characters were generated with 4d6-drop-lowest for each stat, right? well if the first character to interact had their second-highest ability be a 16 or more, then the mirror recognizes the innate strengths of its finder and the curse is lifted, otherwise the curse is present for another 100 years". That's about 1/6, but it feels like a perfectly blorby version of randomness to me.                        </div>

                            That's a good "deep" read of the issue. The counterfactual claim makes it feel less "real".<br/><br/>There's also a much "shallower" possible read, such as a higher-order principle in effect, something perhaps like "the contents of the blorb should not be contingent on the identity of the characters exploring it", and this technique, while technically acceptable in terms of its outcomes, is violating that principle, and therefore 'feels' off.<br/><br/>(Although lots of blorby games break this!)                        </div>

                            Counterfactuals are my favorite thing. I think they're incredibly useful for thinking about blorb or just hygienic GMing in general. One of the most important habits I have formed as a GM is, after a session, making sure that there are events that could have gone differently but for PC decision-making and/or luck of the dice. (This is particularly important if the session goes in the way that would have been most predictable or seemed most likely ahead of time.)<br/><br/>These sorts of mechanics — D and E in Guy's original post—sort of almost break counterfactual thinking. Maybe that's why they seem problematic?<br/><br/>I can give a great example from an actual module, by the way. Throughout "Against the Giants," when the PCs are searching treasure rooms or whatever, there will be like 100 barrels. And Gygax would write shit like, "the magic golden ring is in the 74th barrel the PCs search." Which is <b>weird</b>, right? Because it prevents things like saying, "If only we had searched in the opposite order, then the treasure would have been in the 26th barrel! We would have spent so much less time and resources here!"<br/><br/>That's not identical to what Guy is talking about, but it just feels unnecessarily un-blorb. Like, why not just have barrels labeled <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-100&amp;Mode=like">#1-100</a>, and ask the PCs what order they search them in, and the treasure is in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2374&amp;Mode=like">#74</a>? It's much more blorb and agency-respecting, IMO.                        </div>

                            That die roll could be based on anything, and since the mirror is magic (even sentient perhaps), any good GM could come up with a diegetic justification for the mirror's bizarre method of "choosing" one PC, or "deciding" what it's going to do.  Height, hair color, species, alignment...  <br/><br/>The last sentence of (c) - has me thinking about items which have the ability to randomly affect the GM's presentation.  Off-the-cuff example: Imagine something like this in a module:<br/><br/>1: The mirror is cursed and emits baleful energy: GM's description should be frightening.<br/>2: The mirror is cursed but the curse is well-veiled: GM's description should be innocuous.<br/>3: As (2) but it looks funny/weird: GM's description should be elaborate and symbolic.<br/>4: As (2) but it looks funny/haha: GM's description should be humorous.<br/>5: As (1) but favors a random PC: GM's description should make this PC feel safe from the curse, and they are.<br/>6: The mirror is not cursed, but GM's description should imply that it is.<br/><br/> </div>

                            The way I look at it, they’re *trying* to be blorb, but missing the mark, because of the contingency issue. But they’re close, in some ways, as Vivificient’s rewrite shows (which just puts a different gloss on the same technique, and makes it work). So that’s interesting!<br/><br/>Here’s an interesting conundrum: does it change things if it’s all transparent and known to the players? <br/><br/>Like, the GM’s methods are known, communicated to the players, and written in the module (so we could check later, if we wanted). The players know that the order in which they interact with the mirror matters, in other words. It becomes not just part of the reality of the game world, but also part of our “system” for how we interact with it up here in real life (at the table). <br/><br/>That’s also kind of fun to think about. How much do those factors matter?                         </div>

                            For me, (a) and (b) are equally fine, with the implicit provision that the status of the mirror is also rolled whenever it would have to be determined in the fiction, which might also happen in a multitude of ways. If the mirror is unique, (a) is more convenient and easier to keep track of. (b) might be more convenient if these mirrors are frequent, or if the referee thinks they would be highly tempted to hint at which options is true.<br/><br/>(c) asks the referee to withhold information - this, much as a request to provide information, feels bad. Players get the information they get via their play, and exceptions would require some strange effect. Maybe in some fey realm one always fails to keep track of whatever one tries to look at, for example, so that the referee should explain their appearance in detail but be awfully vague about their location.<br/><br/>Concerning (d) and (e): I am not sure, but this might go back to the (dis/as)sociated mechanics - do we have an explanation of what is going on, or are we abstracting something with an explanation? Those tend to be more acceptable.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a request for counterexamples.                        </div>

                            Example A, the latter example would be better in a klokkverk/blorb game:<br/><br/>1. Referee selects a character. If that character is the first to touch the mirror, it is deadly; otherwise it is inert.<br/><br/>2. The mirror, by using telepathy, randomly imprints on a single character. If that character is the first to touch the mirror it is deadly; otherwise it is inert.<br/><br/><br/>Example B, the latter example would be better in a klokkverk/blorb game:<br/><br/>1. The spoon is in the first chest that is opened.<br/><br/>2. An invisible gnome teleports the spoon so that it is in the first chest that is opened.<br/><br/><br/>In both examples, A and B, option two is better for blorb/klokkverk and more associated.<br/><br/>When I am reading an adventure which includes stupidity like the spoon being in the first chest to be opened, I usually simple randomize the chest where it is, or roll a die to see if the spoon is wherever the players look or would otherwise determine the location by using their spoon sense or whatever. The implicit assumption is that someone has placed the spoon in a chest, and if there is no further detail given, than it might be in any chest, so I'll just roll randomly where it actually is.<br/><br/><br/>Examples A and B are textbook examples of associating the mechanic, with all the usual effects - they are more complicated than they would be without the association, they might interact strangely with play (as mentioned above: someone might be protected from telepathy or see the invisible or what not) and not create the assumed effect, but consequently they also more robust for players trying some strange experiment.<br/><br/><br/>My own method is not a textbook example of association. It can be seen that way, but it is not, at least for me, quite the obvious explanation it is in the scenarios A and B. I have not yet figured out a good explanation, but it should be within reach.<br/><br/><br/>To me, this suggests that if the mechanic is associated, it is fine. It might be bad for other reasons, but not being blorby/klokkverk enough is not one of them. (If the mechanism is too obscure, than it might seem unblorby/uklokkverk to the players, for example.)<br/><br/>But I expect that there are other grounds for declaring something fine. This is why having actual examples is useful, whereas blanket statements do not add insight, only peer pressure. Give examples of blorby ways of determining whether the mirror is magical or not, and where the spoon is, that are dissociated.<br/><br/>Since association is as relevant to the question as humor theory is to medicine (at best), this ought to be a trivial task.                        </div>

                            One observation is that the unblorby/uklokkeverk scenarios are more predictable than the blorb/klokkverk scenarios.<br/><br/>In unblorb, the spoon is in the first chest you open. In blorb, it might also be in the third one, or maybe you detect or interfere with the invisible gnome have a talk with them.<br/><br/>Likewise with sensitivity to telepathy and the potentially magical mirror.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the more unpredictable things are, the more blorb they are - the fictional world does not cohesion, too. But I certainly use the unpredictability of an adventure as a measuring device - if it is clear how it will end, it is less interesting, and there hopefully are some potential situations in the adventure where I have no idea what would happen.<br/><br/>But I think nonpredictability is more of a heuristic, less a characterization.                        </div>

                            The visible tip of the iceberg is as you say :  preparing the setting for a Klokverk is always making immanent, intra diegetic, "real in the fiction", associated factoids rules.<br/>But what is "associated rules" is still up in the air.

                            Yeah, I’m with you, Vincent! That’s a great example.<br/><br/>Thanuir, isn’t “let’s roll a die to see which chest the spoon is in” pretty obviously both blorb and dissociated?<br/><br/>I think that the reason those “associated” versions you posted work better is because they’re more interactive. They assign logical causes to what’s happening, which allows us to consider different possibilities, instead of dictating something from on high and then twisting the fiction to match. I’m not sure whether that’s the same as association or not. (In great part because I’m not sure “association” can ever have a consistent definition, as we already hashed to death in the older thread.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, pondering the contingency issue is interesting. We generally want to avoid contingency in blorb, but do we know that it’s a rule without edge cases? I’m not sure just yet.                        </div>

                            Up top, Guy starts with blorb and works outward. I want to see if I can work my example back toward blorb:<br/><br/>L1, same as above: Prep says "it's either a cursed mirror or a nonmagical mirror, normal in every way. When the PCs enter the room, choose one at random. If that character is the first to investigate the mirror, the mirror is normal, nonmagical. If another character, cursed. Six hundred years ago, the archwizard Palurum of Amathon theorized that such a mirror could exist, and offered several possible explanations for its nature and functioning, but his work on the subject remains both speculative and obscure."<br/><br/>This invokes offscreen canon gamestate without offering an in-fiction explanation. Not blorb.<br/><br/>L2: Prep says "it's either a cursed mirror or a nonmagical mirror, normal in every way. When the PCs enter the room, choose one at random. If that character is the first to investigate the mirror, the mirror is normal, nonmagical. If another character, cursed. Six hundred years ago, the archwizard Palurum of Amathon created this mirror by accident, and while he was able to probe its nature and functioning to some extent, a complete understanding of it escaped him all his life."<br/><br/>This invokes offscreen canon gamestate and gives the mirror an in-fiction origin, without offering an in-fiction explanation.<br/><br/>L3: Prep says "it's a cursed mirror, but when the PCs enter the room, choose one at random. If that character is the first to investigate the mirror, the curse is broken and the mirror loses all magical potency. If another character, it remains cursed. Six hundred years ago, the archwizard Palurum of Amathon happened to see this character in a scrying pool, and, in the majesty of his power, created the mirror intentionally to have this effect, although his reasons for doing so are lost to us. Perhaps another vision in his scrying pool, of an even more distant future, led him to do so."<br/><br/>This one's got offscreen canon gamestate, an in-fiction origin, an in-fiction explanation for its functioning (or at least a sketchy grounding of its functioning in the fiction), and it does away with the hilarious magical-or-not contradiction, but it still makes that random choice of character.<br/><br/>I guess my questions are:<br/><br/>1. My understanding is that the random choice of character means tier 2 truth, thus, not blorb. Sandra, is this what makes it not blorb, or have I seized on that incorrectly?<br/><br/>2. Each step I take makes the mirror feel more real to me. Sandra, Thanuir, Jeph, Guy, how about you?<br/><br/>Each step I take also makes the canon offscreen gamestate bigger, deeper, more complex, and/or more self-consistent. For me, this isn't a coincidence. What do you think?                        </div>

<blockquote>My understanding is that the random choice of character means tier 2 truth, thus, not blorb.</blockquote>
Random choice of character is not a tier 2 truth. It is a mix of fixing the prep, then tier 3, then tier 2. What happened in L3 is this: six hundred years ago, Palurum of Amathon looked into a scrying pool and saw... [big blank in prep. really big. you can't insert a character here because that character might not even exist? you can't insert the random table "pick one PC" because that's not what the archwizard did at all]. So you, as GM, say to yourself "okay the closest reasonable fix to the prep is that the archwizard saw one of the people entering the room at around this time, but how do I choose?"<br/><br/>Then to determine how you choose, you tier-3 improvise a new tier-2 rule for this room+archwizard+mirror encounter: you will pick uniformly at random from those people which Palurum of Amathon could have seen in their scrying pool.                        </div>

I'm not being asked directly, but I agree with all of the above.<br/><br/>Some observations:<br/><br/>1. From a blorb group, I think the issue is that "choose a character at random" selects from a contingent group (the PCs entering the room), which limits our ability to play this for a properly "blorb" perspective.<br/><br/>It is contingent on out-of-game facts (like the characters being portrayed by human players), making it hard to adjudicate. When something is hard to adjudicate impartially, that seems to me to harm the integrity of the blorb.<br/><br/>What if the PCs send a group of henchmen into the room, to investigate the mirror, for instance? What if some of those PCs are being played, just for the moment, by one of the players? (And so on.)<br/><br/>Those are hard calls, in a way that a non-contingent offscreen gamestate answer would make easy. <br/><br/>Consider this counterexample:
<blockquote><br/>The mirror has been covered since it was created. When a human looks into the mirror for the first time, roll a d6. On a 1, this is the person Palurum of Amathon scried two hundred years ago, and the mirror [does its thing].<br/></blockquote>
2. Vincent, you're using the term "offscreen canon gamestate" quite freely and confidently here. <br/><br/>What does it mean to you?<br/><br/>How is it distinct from "prep" or "backstory", or other such terms? Is there a categorical difference between, say, a backstory I write for my character, and this bit of text about the mirror? What parts of the texts you wrote <i>are</i> "offscreen canon gamestate", what parts <i>refer to</i> "offscreen canon gamestate", and which are not?                        </div>

                            More setting objects and facts (the wizard, their works, etc.) mean more ways for the players to indirectly interact with the trap (the mirror). They grant a simulacrum of reality. But if these informations are not accessible to the players, no gain.<br/>I see this as separated from the core of the question which for me is "targeting the players rather than the characters". The character is not targeted for being a body, a soul or anything present. Rather it is targeted as being a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">player</span> character. What is described looks like a "suspense" technique, rather than a trap.                        </div>

                            I've actually been wondering about the player-facing vs. GM-facing aspects of this, too. For instance, some "blorb" techniques could make things feel more "real" for players on one side of the screen, but not the other.                        </div>

                            Guy, Thanuir, DeReel: Aha! Thank you, that helps me. I'm going to keep thinking about this.<br/><br/>I have a couple of, I dunno, explanatory side points.<br/><br/>First is, the commonality between <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486311/#Comment_486311" rel="nofollow">my mirror story</a> and Sandra's can't be found in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/486144/#Comment_486144" rel="nofollow">her working principles</a> at all. Instead, what her mirror story and mine have in common are:
<ul><li>A fully-symmetrical shared commitment to treating our imaginary world as real;</li><li>A robust canon offscreen gamestate.</li></ul>
The latter of which I hadn't considered, as such, until Sandra pointed it out to me.<br/><br/>So these are where my interests lie right now.<br/><br/>Second is, one funny feature of the way I approach all this, which you may not know about me, is that just like I'm perfectly happy to peer into the game world to see what's going on there, I'm perfectly happy to show the people there - especially wizards, for whom I have a special and malicious fondness - glimpses of our world. For me it doesn't strain anything to suppose that 600 years ago in the game world a wizard saw the events of our game in a scrying pool and, in some way, understood these particular warriors &amp; thieves &amp; whatever to be <i>set apart</i> from others in the world, by virtue of our world-crossing attention to them, and also, in some way, understood our die roll to descend upon them in the form of some kind of metaphysical randomness. I'm perfectly satisfied to say "the wizard pondered this until the end of his life, and for some years after, but could never arrive at a fully satisfactory theory," and snicker about it because I know the truth and he doesn't.<br/><br/>I get that not everybody can tolerate this kind of nonsense, but I enjoy it.                        </div>

<small>Setting aside the question of whether L3 is actually good gameplay…</small><br/><br/>L3 is fine.

A couple of comments.<br/><br/>First is, one does not usually know if some information will or will not be available to players. They might or might not hear rumours, do the research, use some divination spell, talk with some dungeon residents who know about it, etc. If the game uses some sort of knowledge rolls, most any single fact about the history of wizards and similar issues might turn out to be known, even if the entire history is likely to not be found out.<br/><br/>Second, even if the background information is unknown to the players, it still guides the decisions of the game master when they interpret, describe and make judgements. If the players notice patterns, like there being lots of metagamish divinatory effects in the dungeon, they can use this to guess at what they might encounter later. The fiction is likely to be more coherent is the game mastering has background knowledge to work with.

I think this is mostly a matter of taste - I am fine with occasional bits of that, but my interest is (by default) in interacting with a world that does not care about my character, through my character, and them having too much of a special status in the fiction will fight against this.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I think it is worth investigating if Sandra's observation extends to other scenarios besides this.                        </div>

                            Isn't this "If the players notice patterns, like there being lots of metagamish divinatory effects in the dungeon" precisely the players getting information, be it via lore or GM reading.

<blockquote>I'm perfectly happy to show the people [in the game world] - especially wizards, for whom I have a special and malicious fondness - glimpses of our world.</blockquote>
Assuming consistent world-lines, this makes for an interesting conceit at the table. If the players have knowledge that characters hundreds of years past in-game can scry the players' present, then:<br/><br/>* they can take actions to try to change the wizards-past's actions which will change the state of their characters' present, but also<br/>* they know that they will not be able to take actions which will result in the wizards-past taking actions which will change the characters' past, but that inability will really not feel unnatural, simply a fact about the world, perhaps a fact that feels unrelated to wizarding at all<br/><br/>This can manifest in rules such as "when you attempt to deus wizard your character out of a situation, state your plea (or otherwise) and draw (edit: until you draw a result, however many constraints that takes)" and a deck of cards full of maybe 3/4 constraints and 1/4 result oracles. Constraints look like "before the session ends your character must proffer to a nearby immanence that Ammonem the Gnarled may not actually have been the tyrant history has made them out to be, seeking out an immanence if none is immediately available" or "under no circumstances may you enter [pick a room] again". Result oracles look like "draw from the unearthly omens deck; the character experiences this omen, the player interprets it as an action, that action succeeds", or "ask the player to your right for an adjective; use it as a prompt to describe why you have totally decided of your own free will that you will actually not be attempting to deus wizard your character out of this situation (yes, previously drawn constraints are still binding)".<br/><br/>Edit: the reason this makes sense to me is because of the side effect of a specific type of superpower in the nearly complete trilogy by W. Dow Rieder, first story here <a href="https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents</a>, where if you get dangersense and precognition by way of receiving nightmarish messages from your future self in terrible futures so that you can avert them, if two such people are interacting, you can come closer and closer to infinite causal loops that don't take time, which, regardless of how they eventually resolve, result in arbitrarily weird nearby consequences.                        </div>

                            The idea that the most powerful magic in the game is able to overstep the boundaries of blorb is one that gives me a lot of joy right now. Of course as the GM I don't get to use it that way—although I could imagine using it as per lumpley's example 3, I haven't and I think would prefer not to. But this is something that I explicitly offer to high-level players. I've rewritten <em>Contact Other Plane</em> to present a new scenario:<br/><br/>The magic-user desires to know if the mirror is cursed. They use <em>Contact other plane</em> to ask the following questions, to which I reply with the answer given in my notes, as normal blorb:<br/><br/>1. Is the mirror cursed? Yes.<br/>2. Who was the mirror made by? Palurum of Amathon<br/>3. When was the mirror made? 600 years ago<br/>4. Does the curse of the mirror happen only once or many times?<br/><br/>Upon asking question four, our magic-user fails their saving throw against paralysis. This means that one of the answers given during the casting of this spell will turn out to be false. I put off rolling for this until such time as the players discover one of these truths—when someone uncovers the mirror, I roll a 1–2 on d6, and it turns out it isn't cursed at all. I draw a big X through a whole section of my dungeon notes and maybe have to fall back to tier 3 the next time Paralum comes up (if I don't have a chance to do proper away-from table prep first).<br/><br/>My players rightly perceive magic of this nature to be perilous and unnatural, going against the blorby practices they've been operating under for literal years in order to reach this point. Everyone at the table gets scared when the magic-user announces they are going to use this spell.                        </div>

I agree with that.<br/><br/>If the wizard bit is incidental and separate from everything else, then it does not say much. But maybe there is more about the wizard in the hypothetical dungeon module, either in the history or scattered around the text as such offhand mentions. Or maybe it happens to fit with a particular wizard in the history of the referee's world, so they replace the wizard's name with a more relevant one. I do this with adventures and their histories all the time - replace the cultures there with more relevant ones. Rarely, if ever, non-player characters.

Experimentation is fine and these kinds of things might well work for some people in some groups, while not work at all in other situations.                        </div>

                            "And you don’t make spells that hurt the integrity of the game state." Fool ! your naive meddlings unravel the tapestry of the universe ! <br/>Aren't magical studies precisely for this ? Me, I done the "peek into the real world" in my early gaming days (done that). It's totally in genre : L. Sprague de Camp does this in The unbeheaded king. Corben's Den is all about this. The D&amp;D animations series was all about cross universes. Even Stranger things' view on D&amp;D is : a game with heavy handed parallels with Real Life. Sure, it gets old quick, but it's also kind of a direct consequence of RP.                        </div>

                            Hmm I have been chewing on the idea of “hurting the...game state” a little and while perhaps I wouldn't use the word “hurt” this is actually a thing that I feel my game can be about: that I'm quite interested in the idea of “ending” in a few senses, as a consequence of high-level play (at the end of the numbered levels, when such magic is available) and also in terms of themes or fiction of apocalypse (and the possibility that the players might cause this). So maybe it's working for me specifically because of the threat it poses to the game fundamentals.<br/><br/>Anyway I did also want to say that I love the language developing in these threads <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> and I do feel that I am learning things about my own play from them every time I take an afternoon to dive back into how they have developed.                        </div>
