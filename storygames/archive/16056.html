So there has been a fair number of discussions (and usually are after a big con where we can air our frustrations) about players who are not engaging with our games on some level.  It's work.  It's not the loving story zeitgeist that generate pure awesome.  <br/><br/>I get that when at a convention you don't have a lot of control over who comes to the table (although now a days I have pretty specific people play my games, often at direct invitation).  I get we have friends that want to game with us and it's hard to exclude them.  It's not impossible but it's not easy either.<br/><br/>So I get why we want to talk about "how can we better interact with a challenging player."<br/><br/>That being said:<br/><br/>God!  Am I am bad person for not wanting to game with this type of player?  No matter what my role I go to the table with these expectations: Bring the fun!  Make everyone else look awesome!  A good number of folks here have played with me.  Am I a bully? (really, I'm asking so no ego here.  Open, honest communication accepted).<br/><br/>Now I am not trying to make this a pity party or an introspection of "why we can't get the dog to play with Don."  It's not about me specifically but I don't mind it if it's helpful and part of the equation.  I'm boorish, opinionated and direct.  I'm a 42 year old man.  I can live with the social freight train perspective.  <br/><br/>What I am looking for is this: What is the problem with putting the responsibility of maintaining social contract squarely on the shoulders of every player?  I've always been about communicating what the game is about and what we all expect at the table.  On occasion I have had to pull awesome out of people but eventually they get it or they don't come back.  I just don't have a problem saying "hey, clearly you are running from conflict in the game and we said from the beginning that wasn't in the spirit of the game.  It's cool if this style of play isn't your cup of tea but shit or get off the pot."<br/><br/>Thank for your input,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365917/#Comment_365917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T08:29:07+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:29AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The nature of humanity in all its variety is a continuum. There are no conventional labels on people to help us build perfect game groups all the time. This alone causes the necessity for introspection and choices: is this player <i>enough</i> of a team-player from my viewpoint to continue playing with him? It's a continuous process, and it's not as simple as putting some people in the green box and others in the red.<br/><br/>Aside from that, though, I don't see a problem with being ambitious and building an optimal gaming group that's all prime player material. Go to it, by all means. It's a lot like band-building, I'm told.<br/><br/>I personally am constantly in outreach mode out of habit if nothing else. The good part is that I don't exactly hurt for players, nothing resembling the problems some folks have with getting a group together despite my living on the northern periphery of the continent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365922/#Comment_365922" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T08:39:44+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:39AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 8:48AM by Judd.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/><br/>No, you are not a bad person but you might be a lazy person (I'm not calling Don or anyone lazy (yet)).<br/><br/>When you say: "hey, clearly you are running from conflict in the game and we said from the beginning that wasn't in the spirit of the game.

It's cool if this style of play isn't your cup of tea but I'm here to help if you you need.  Look at your beliefs and attack one head on and I promise we'll have some fun."<br/><br/>It is a subtle change.  One is a confrontation and the other is supportive.  Sometimes we have to realize that a game's style of play might not only be alien but might be behavior for which a player might get jeered at where they game every week.  Easing them out of that mode can take just a little doing.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not saying that we should be anyone's psychiatrist or occupational therapist.  Sometimes, it is the wrong person at the wrong table at the wrong time.  But I'd make that supportive effort and see how it flies first.<br/><br/>Judd<br/><br/>P.S.

("Ok, so you're not sure what you want to do next, well, let's cut to Adrienne.") I then felt guilty afterwards for not giving him his share of screen-time. I never saw him again. Maybe<i> I personally killed story games for him!</i> If only I'd run a better game, he'd still be playing today!  <br/><br/>I think my problem is I'm balancing evangelism (this is the most fun thing evar and I want to share) with having a good time in this particular session (I don't really want Joe Trad Gamer to play with us tonight because it will probably put a damper on the whole session.)<br/><br/>And ... evangelism is pretty dumb ... why try to push this stuff on people that they don't want or appreciate? One of these days I'm going to give up on it, and just have fun with people I know rock. So if you don't suffer from my evangelism complex, more power to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365957/#Comment_365957" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T09:46:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>evangelism is pretty dumb</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365964/#Comment_365964" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T10:05:13+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 10:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been a pretty successful\u2014I think\u2014S-G "evangelist" at cons but with my home games I'm a bit more ruthless.<br/><br/>Don, the last time I gamed with you was at Recess in the fall, playing Kagematsu with Terry... we had you, me, Seraphina, and this guy who had never roleplayed before, except earlier in the day when I ran a brutal Mouse Guard session for him and a few others. He was a bit awkward, and seemed to have some mild speech issues as well, but was very open-minded and a really good guy to play with. You, Don, weren't a bit a bully and I feel like all four of us did a good job of supporting that new guy and drawing him out so that he could fully contribute. So there's a good example of how someone new to the playstyle can be fine to have in a game as long as they are merely uncertain, not *actively* blocking.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365971/#Comment_365971" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T10:19:09+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 10:19AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I always consider is "was I <i>really</i> as clear as I thought I was when I was talking about expectations?"

A player left around session 20 and the game suddenly and dramatically took off.  I was so stunned, it took me several days to figure out what had happened.<br/><br/>He was bored, I was trying to rescue him, and that shifted my focus away from making the game awesome.  This is a downward spiral, and my chief regret is that he noticed before I did.  When he left, that energy was suddenly freed up, and the players were creating things let right and center, it was amazing.  I much prefer it this way than the other way, so no, I don't fault you at all for trying to game with like-minded people trying to achieve something particular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366232/#Comment_366232" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:21:23+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conventions are more like dating.

I don't mind a bit of tutelage when new people come to the table.  That's kinda exciting.  I ran a zombipolalypse version of Contenders once and it SUCKED!  Not because the mashup didn't click but the players just weren't into it and weren't willing to plug in.

So, JD, no evangelism isn't quite "dumb," or at least I've done it and do it consistently because there are cool people I would have liked to game with but they just didn't get it and I really was too lazy/impatient to try harder.<br/><br/>I think part of my reaction to these conversations are that I have more limited time than I did a decade ago and so I don't want to spend a lot of time bringing folks "up to speed." <br/><br/>If one wants to plug into conventions, however, there is a certain amount of time you have to assume you're going to  interact with folks that are used to doing things a certain way.Better to be an ambassador than a gatekeeper.<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366408/#Comment_366408" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T10:09:58+00:00" title="March 10, 2012 10:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don, I don't think it is lazy to just say, "I don't want to deal with this shit."

I don't mind a bit of tutelage when new people come to the table.  That's kinda exciting...Had I known what I knew now I would have taken much more of a proactive approach from the beginning and said "this is the kind of game this is.  Still here?"<br/></blockquote>\nDon, <br/>You've already mentioned the 'challenging' player I encountered in the BW game at Dreamation, in which you also played.  As you indicated, this player was not blocking.  She was, instead, strangely confrontational I thought...aggressive or accusatory even.  You'll recall the point where she seemed to be incensed that I had (perhaps) left off one way to get more dice in a BW test through spending persona points.  Holy smokes!  <br/>At one point, I was close to telling her it was either her or me; that I wasn't going to run the game with her in it--and this was at a 4-hour convention slot!  I like to think I can hold my breath for four hours!  But I didn't for three reasons.  First, she paid her money and I'm obligated to run the game as best I can.  If I wanted to play only with people I know then I would not be at conventions.  Second, it wouldn't be fair to the other players...although perhaps everyone would have been happier.  But third and primarily, because I decided not to let her ruin my fun.  I enjoy playing with you, with Greg, and the other players.  Even her husband?  Boyfriend?   Father?  My regret is that her behavior, or perhaps even the discord she had with me because of something I did, may have detracted from the other players' fun and certainly distracted me. <br/>I would not play with her again, and if I can remember her last name I will let Vinnie know for future cons. She might not play with me, either!  Inshallah!<br/>My theory, and I am purely speculating now because it's fun, is that she plays in a game ran by her husband.  In this game she is the star of the show, enjoying all the spotlight time and certainly always successful.  So when she does not receive the same kind of treatment elsewhere she reacts badly...or I'm a bad GM with poor communication and social skills.  I intend to talk more about this game on a future episode at Virtual Play. I'd love to have you chime in with your perspective as a player at the table. <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366501/#Comment_366501" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T23:40:01+00:00" title="March 10, 2012 11:40PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don, the only questionable case I can see is at a con, and the solution depends on how you see your responsibilities there.<br/><br/>Personally, as much as I'd love to play only with people who bring the awesome, I see RPG conventions as events where it's typical for awkward folks to pay money to be shown a good time in a welcoming social environment, and I'd like to oblige them.  I consider their right to do what they want at my table to be infinite, up until the point where they're making it hard for another player to have fun.  (If that's by making it impossible for me to GM, that counts too.)<br/><br/>I've never played with anyone who <i>deliberately</i> ruined everyone's fun.  I think I'd have no problem kicking them out of my circle of responsibility.  "I no longer care about your good time.  If you want your money back, tell the con organizer to talk to me later."<br/><br/>When someone is <i>accidentally</i> ruining the fun, I do consider it my responsibility to do everything I can to find a solution that works for everyone.  That person who's out of synch with the game and group is probably the person who <i>most</i> needs the friendly safe space a con may seem to offer.<br/><br/>I find this difficult and taxing, and it's why I don't sign up to GM at cons lightly, and why I want free registration.<br/><br/>Perhaps if everyone approached it the way I do, there wouldn't be enough GMs at cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366525/#Comment_366525" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T07:24:46+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  7:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2012 7:24AM by Brian_Minter.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>And ... evangelism is pretty dumb ... </blockquote>\nThis is probably a topic for another thread, but I don't think evangelism is dumb.

Good evangelism also stays positive, talking about why this thing is great and particularly why the person you're talking to would find it appealing.  When you go negative with it, bashing something else in order to praise what you like, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose your audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366719/#Comment_366719" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-12T03:22:32+00:00" title="March 12, 2012  3:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>When you go negative with it, bashing something else in order to praise what you like, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose your audience.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
