Dont post very often but definitely lurk. Got a few questions for you. I'm designing a game about investigators who enter the dreams of others in a format similar to "inception" or "the cell". In the dreams, their power is almost Godlike. This is not something I want to change or limit. Changing the dream framework is a skill. Talents however, are special abilities that individual players can possess. They range from a mundane re-roll, to a spell like ability. So my question being, how do I quanitify these to add balance?  Should I make a point buy system for the talents? A stepwise talent system like spells in dnd that only unlock as you get stronger? How do I quanitify and limit them so that if one player choses one, and another player choses another that it is still fair? Below are a few examples so you know what I'm working with. My problem is that some of these are rather abstract:<br/><br/><b>Veritas</b><br/>On a successful social roll intended to deceive your target, the target believes you. Spend one sanity to make the lie the truth. No matter how outlandish it is. <br/><i>Ex: Charlie is trying to convince the figment hotel concierge that he has a room reservation. He doesn't he rolls his social roll in an attempt to deceive and he succeeds. He spends one sanity and the concierge finds that he does indeed have a hotel reservation under the name he gave.</i><br/><br/><b>Coping Mechanism</b><br/>Once per session, instead of taking a sanity hit, you can decline. But as a result you have to invent another detrimental effect that befalls your character in the form of a coping mechanism that is present for the rest of the session. This will have to be discussed with your GM so that it can be made into something you both agree on. Failure to adequately roleplay the coping mechanism for the duration of the session will result in the sanity hit.<br/><i>Ex: The player says he would like to develop a drinking problem because he feels as though its fitting for the character. During the game he's given several opportunities to drink but declines. As a result the GM requires him at a point he deems appropriate to charge him the sanity he would have saved on the coping mechanism.</i><br/><br/><b>Invasive Thought</b> <br/>Spend one sanity to intentionally bring over one element of your subconscious to help you. That element then must hinder you in another way. This hindrance must be at least the same degree of the help you received. <br/><i>Ex: Joseph is in the middle of a gunfight, bullets are flying close to his head and if he doesn't think fast him and his team could be dead. Suddenly, his player says, the thought of his childhood dog, a german shepard, flashes through his consciousness. Suddenly, Spluffles charges into the battlefield and begins fighting on their behalf! Once all enemies are killed however, Spluffles continues to attack, starting with Joseph's best friend. Joseph must now make an executive decision.</i><br/><br/><b>Invoke Pavlov</b><br/>Player selects one object in the dream to imbue with special properties. The PC establishes a pattern in the object (such as ringing a bell, saying a specific phrase) three times and "links" it with three responses that will then happen in the presence of the object whenever the pattern is repeated. The world does take 1d4 dream damage for the use of this talent, and it must be rolled for with the Alter Reality skill. There is no sanity loss.<br/><i>Ex: Player wishes to link the clicking of his pen with the breaking of glass, so he can use it to break any glass object he points it at in the future. He clicks the pen once, and breaks a piece of glass. He clicks it again and does it a second time, then a third time. Now, he is finding that whenever his clicks the pen, the glass breaks without him actually doing anything directly himself.</i><br/><br/>I would appreciate any input thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidC" title="DavidC"><img alt="DavidC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidC">DavidC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445013/#Comment_445013" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-30T10:28:29+00:00" title="April 30, 2015 10:28AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about you have two resources players have.  One is their more permanent blue tokens (sanity?) and the other are red tokens that are a temporary debt against that.  Players can choose to do any of the feats listed above, but must immediately pay out the activation cost in blue tokens, or take red tokens. They can try and pay off the red tokens by the end of the session/scene/arc by having the counter-action happen (Spluffles attacking, becoming an alcoholic, etc.)  The GM then takes back one or more of the red tokens whenever the player behaves for the counter-action.  At the end of the session, you have to pay off any of your remaining red tokens from your blue tokens.  <br/><br/>Players could choose certain actions that they are more adept at, so if I'm adept at Invoke Pavlov, I only get 2 red tokens instead of 3 red tokens.<br/><br/>You could then tie the total red tokens at the table to the stability of the dream.  So if my players get 10 red tokens out at once, the dream collapses.  <br/><br/>The reason I suggest this method is because it lets you price out the relative power of each, but the overall balance is less important, because all players have access to all powers - just not at the same level.   <br/><br/>The game itself sounds really interesting, I'm looking forward to hearing more about it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445016/#Comment_445016" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-30T13:17:00+00:00" title="April 30, 2015  1:17PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about you randomize what everybody gets? That way the individual feats don't need to be balanced. If you want, have the players vote for the strongest character at the end of a session and rerandomize them so as to slowly iterate towards perfect balance.<br/><br/>Alternatively, make it a preferential selection process of some sort, like an auction or a take-or-leave binary choice. For example, you could randomize one feat at a time (at the start of a session, for example) to be auctioned off to the character who'll pay the most for it in some currency or other. Or you could have opportunities for feats pop up on occasion in play based on the events (maybe feat trainers or something), and the players get to choose who gets the feat and whether anybody wants it or not.<br/><br/>Maybe having feats causes an extra on-going expense of some sort, so that the players want to pick and choose which feats to retain and which to drop. A per-session cost in some resource, for example. Then it's not a matter of trying to get every feat you can, but rather a matter of planning your load-out according to what you have available at the moment, and what you want to drop.<br/><br/>This is to say, there are lots of solutions out there that do not rely on boring and difficult to balance point-buys or tier systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445019/#Comment_445019" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-30T17:22:17+00:00" title="April 30, 2015  5:22PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say talents should be something completely different to mind tricks. I mean, I consider the ability to think in space a talent, like the architect talent on Inception, where making another person believe something so her believe reshapes the world is a trick anybody could learn. These tricks come up from the fact that the dreamworld has rules that can be played with, which ends up giving the players godlike powers, as long as they don't break the rules.<br/><br/>So you could have talents that work like classes and give PCs a paradigm to play with the rules of the dreamworld. I'd base them on that <a href="http://www.tecweb.org/styles/gardner.html" rel="nofollow">para-scientific stuff about the 7 intelligences</a> for ease of use, but you can also use different things, maybe based on the actual professions of the PCs or even the actual players. Like, if you're a designer, you can operate things in dreams as if they were images; if you're an accountant you can see the math behind the dreamworld and change it, etc. Of course, major changes affect the stability of the dreamworld, so players should use their talents sparingly. <br/><br/>Mindtricks on the other hand can be something players find out on their own trough experimentation. I mean, if you tell them that one of the major rules of the dreamworld is that belief make things real and that other of the rules is that making other people believe in something is easier than believing them yourself, you can easily discover Veritas by yourself, and possibly many more imaginative mindtricks.<br/><br/>But I also like that PCs bring their own problematic psyche into the equation. I'd say let PCs have a few skeletons on their closets, that come out in different ways when they fail rolls to change the dreamworld or receive some sort of damage to their ego when they are there. They may have a complex with a part of their body that may grow, shrink or change shape out of control. Their coping mechanisms get activated: a nervous tick, drinking problems, crying, getting angry, etc.<br/><br/>Also, other main rule should be that the dreamworld needs to keep it's coherence, but that doesn't mean that completely weird things doesn't happen, but that once they start happen <i>they can't stop</i> .<br/><br/>But perhaps I'm thinking of a completely different game, so let me know if you don't use anything here, maybe I should make a game of my own with all this stuff <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja" title="Ferninja"><img alt="Ferninja" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/663/n5I0JAA0QAU5X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ferninja">Ferninja</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445020/#Comment_445020" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-30T17:42:06+00:00" title="April 30, 2015  5:42PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I.

Is it a question of spotlight (in many forms of fantasy fiction, there are characters like Wizards, who have powers completely out of the realm of the other characters, but this is counterbalanced by them using their powers very rarely), the ability to overcome obstacles, team success, individual competition, the ratio of success to failure, or some other factor?<br/><br/>What problems do you foresee coming from an imbalance?<br/><br/>Your abilities are very interesting: they sound like they would be incredible fun in play.<br/><br/>I like the idea of making them something clever players can come up with during play, as opposed to preset feats you simply choose from.<br/><br/>I like games which create balance by making their creation collaborative. For instance, one player can suggest what a power does ("make a lie into truth"), then two other players suggest possible downsides/costs ("but only if the liar gives up a true thing they know, and now no longer remembers it"). The original player now chooses one of the costs; finally, the GM assigns a number for how many Blue Tokens it takes to activate the power.<br/><br/>Mortal Coil, more than human/less than human (from My Life with Master), the World of Dungeons magic system, and Polaris (or any game where the final product is the outcome of a negotiation) come to mind.<br/><br/>Another approach is to separate effect from the ability itself. For instance, you can have a game with an economy of Power Points.<br/><br/>Whenever you use a Power, a cost is applied:<br/><br/>* If the effect is minor, it costs one Point.<br/>* If the effect is on a large scale, it costs two Points.<br/>* If the effect is incredible, it costs three Points.<br/>* If the effect has an important drawback or painful fallout, you get one Point (back).<br/><br/>So, in play, the character does something, and then the GM or the group asks them to pay the appropriate number of points. Now it doesn't matter if one character's power is "Strongest Man Alive" and another's is "Grotesque and Unlikeable", because the first will quickly run out of points, while the second is likely collecting them. It balances itself, in other words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
