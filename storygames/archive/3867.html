Reeves-McMillan's Third Law: "Fewer things are self-explanatory than I think."<br/><br/>This is what I'm planning to use (much expanded, obviously) as a visual alternative to an index for my setting book. <br/><br/>Ellipses mean themes, squares mean entities.<br/><br/>The black arrows are the relationships between the entities (in this case, fantasy races). The relationships are a kind of entity in their own right; there are some themes that arise not just from one race or another, but in the context of the relationship <i>between</i> the races. This is why there are red arrows coming out of the black arrows. The red arrows mean "if you have this entity, you potentially have this theme in your game". <br/><br/>The idea is that you glance over the circled themes and pick ones that appeal. (They will have page numbers, so you can go and check out only the bits of setting that you're interested in.)<br/><br/>Let's say that Religion, Racism and Gadgets were three themes that grabbed you. You then look at what entities they connect to, and this is your clue as to what character races are likely to show up in your game. <br/><br/>Religion gives you humans, elves, and the humans/elves relationship of former servitude (which gave the humans the sky religion). Racism gives you humans/elves and dwarves/gnomes (that is, racism exists in the context of the relationship between these races, which makes sense). Gadgets gives you dwarves and dwarves/humans.<br/><br/>You then try to achieve this with as few characters as possible. (Sounding familiar, JBR?)<br/><br/>So you will definitely have humans, since they link to all three themes. You will have dwarves, since the Gadgets theme requires dwarves. To get the racism, you need to introduce a third entity - either gnomes or elves. <br/><br/>So, you might have:<br/>- A religious human who invents gadgets<br/>- A gadget-making dwarf<br/>- The dwarf's gnome servant whom he treats as his natural inferior, but who actually does most of the work.<br/><br/>Or you might have:<br/>- A dwarf-made gadget<br/>- A human who owns the gadget<br/>- An elf with whom the human interacts about the Sky Religion.<br/><br/>You could decide based on whether you want to also address gender differences or have gender be a non-issue - in the former case, your setup would be humans/dwarves/gnomes, in the latter dwarves/humans/elves.<br/><br/>Making more sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87100/#Comment_87100" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T15:49:01+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  3:49PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 3:49PM by James McMurray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

At the beginning of a game, you all sit around and talk about what on the coolmap appeals to you, and things you want to add (or delete). Everyone gets two vetoes, which they can use on either people's suggestions of things to add, or on things that are on there already. You don't have to use your vetoes if you don't want to.<br/><br/>You write on any new entities or themes you've agreed on. You then pass the map around the group five times.<br/><br/>At each pass, you may initial any of the entities or themes. This means that you are interested in the entity/theme. You can initial the same one twice (though not more) if you are extra-interested.<br/><br/>After the 5 passes, if any entities are left with only one person's initials, those people get an extra go for each set of initials they have on such an entity. They can put them on any entity, including another one with only one person's initials (not theirs).<br/><br/>Now, "ownership" of the entities is decided by either informal discussion, a bidding system of some kind, or the use of a limited number of chances in much the same way as the above. "Owning" an entity means that you are, basically, the god, spirit, angel or patron saint of that entity - you are its GM. You can declare anything to be true about it (whole group may veto), and if anyone else wants to declare something true about it they need your approval.<br/><br/>Your approval, by the way, should always be given, although you can use "Yes, but", "No, but" or "Yes, and". Again, the whole group may veto, but the owner may not. The closest you have to a veto is the "No, but", which achieves the same thing (you should find out what the person is trying to achieve, of course) by different means, or allows a lesser version which is more in proportion.<br/><br/>If you are the only person with initials on an entity, you can do one of two things. You can automatically own the entity, but you can't create a main character which has it as a motivating attribute; or you can make it a motivating attribute for your main character, but ownership belongs to the group (or to someone else who volunteers to own it).<br/><br/>In general, if you own an entity, your main character can't have it as a motivating attribute.<br/><br/>Entity owners get a "budget" of what were called pentapoints and are now called "fortune". The size of the budget is based on how many initials there are against the entity. With this budget, you get to create supporting characters (and sets and so forth) to interact with the main characters. These are the "faces" on the entity: a priest for a religion, a member of the race for a race, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>You earn additional fortune for hitting the themes that people initialled, again in proportion to how many people initialled them.<br/><br/>So pentapoints/fortune becomes a player currency; pool points are the character currency. Characters can be improved and helped, as well as created, with fortune - I've yet to work out exactly how this works.<br/><br/>I also need to figure out how you deal with emergent themes or shifting interest. Perhaps you just revise the map at the start of each session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88497/#Comment_88497" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-16T23:58:49+00:00" title="August 16, 2007 11:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to say: I like the coolmap a lot!

I was met with blank stares, and in the end left to guess it from their characters and from personally knowing the guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere I to be in the same situation now, I'd surely draw a map like yours and try your method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88797/#Comment_88797" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T14:12:27+00:00" title="August 19, 2007  2:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paolo. <br/><br/>Based on my experience of other group-process things, the advantages of doing this wouldn't stop at "we're all on the same page in terms of what we're looking for in this game", either.

Fucking brilliant dude! I've got a long running campaign (Orpheus: White Wolf game about ghosts) that I want to bring this into so I tested it out with a little tangential session tonight. Here's what I did:<br/><br/><b>Coolmap Creation</b><br/>1. Everyone at the table wrote something that interested them about the game. Themes, locations, NPCs, 'classes', and everything else was fair game.<br/>2. Repeat for a total of 2 entries per person.<br/>3. Everyone takes a turn to connect 2 (or more!) things on the map (including other 'connections') with a line and a description or embodiment of that connection. In your example, Dwarves and Humans are connected with Collaboration and then Dwarves and Collaboration are connected with Gadgets.<br/>4. Repeat step 3.<br/>5. Repeat step 3 for a total of 2 entries and 3 connections per person.<br/><br/>The reason I constrained the creation in this way is because I wanted a tighter focus on what was "cool". I wanted to limit the Range of cool to 2 entries per person (still 14 entries for my group) and then use the Connections to link and develop these entries. It worked really well! We ended up with a tidy little map of 14 things connected all to hell. Some connections were themes or ideas, some were locations, and some were even particular characters.<br/><br/>This created the Coolmap we'll use for this chapter of our campaign.<br/><br/><b>Coolmap Usage</b><br/>After creating the map, I had each Player (not the GM) drop 4 initials anywhere on the map. I broke this into 2 rounds so players had a chance to see what other players were interested in before reinforcing those points or balancing out others.<br/><br/>This created the Coolmap we used for that session.<br/><br/>Every time I hit one of those points, as GM, I got a number of resource points equal to 1 (for introducing something cool) plus the number initials (how cool it is today). In Orpheus, these are Willpower points which could be spent by the NPCs for extra dice on rolls, much like Fate points in Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>It worked famously! I got rewarded for hitting cool shit and today's cool was clearly visible to me. The players didn't mind handing me the reward cause it meant I hit something they were really in the mood for today!<br/><br/><b>Campaign Usage</b><br/>I'll graph out and print up a cleaner version of our coolmap that we can initial before each game session. At the start of a new chapter or story arc in the campaign we'll brainstorm up a new coolmap. I'll need some way to introduce new concepts or characters to the map as their introduced in the game, but I'll figure that out later. Perhaps a nomination from a player and a confirmation from another player is sufficient.<br/><br/>Mike, you mention the map being influenced by Verge, but I've never seen Verge. This is the first time I've seen this idea besides Shock and I like this version much better. My players are absolutely in love with it, they want to use before all rpgs, and one even mentioned several ways he could use it in his non-gaming life. <br/><br/>Thanks dude, this one's a keeper!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213293/#Comment_213293" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T20:28:57+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  8:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent!<br/><br/>And it looks like I may get to playtest it myself next week, as well.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a scan (or photo) of your Coolmap if you could manage one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213296/#Comment_213296" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T20:34:12+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  8:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and my latest iteration of the idea is linked from my more recent thread on the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9411" rel="nofollow">Pentasystem</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
