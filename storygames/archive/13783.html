It sets up some barriers to keeping the integrity of the setting/tone from being broken, but what actually happens within that is entirely up to the players - except that it prompts the players for input to keep it creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were scenes in this game that I don't think we could have gotten out of any other system that we've played (which are mostly of the punchy-narrativism variety). Our group used to play a lot of freeform, and the experience is very similar to that only more stable. It's very slow, it's not very driven, and any scene that touches the mood of the game works, no matter how little or how much happens in it. We had a scene where everyone just described the scenery together. One of the best scenes was two characters playfighting over who gets to sleep in the only bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo: I like that it's not a conflict-driven system. On a player level, it's completely co-operative, and on a fiction level it doesn't force conflicts to drive the story (guess I should note that we explicitly set out to make a slice-of-life story similar to the manga Aria). I think it's an ideal system for if you want to experience just being a particular person in a particular setting - where the person and setting start off sketchy and are developed through play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn't much to not like - but sometimes the scene structure is too rigid for what we needed to do and we broke the rules to do it. The restriction of one 'that might not be quite so easy' per scene is a good one in most cases because it keeps the pacing, but if the scene grows in scope and another would add to it I think following that rule is a bad idea. But that's a rare exception to how things normally play out.<br/>\nOne of the players also didn't 'get' it and was trying to gutpunch up our chillaxed character/setting exploration, but that's not really the system's fault.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311966/#Comment_311966" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T22:27:47+00:00" title="February  9, 2011 10:27PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep in mind that I only played this as one-shots, but I did have a great time with it. I understand it was designed as an ongoing game, howeer, and I'd be curious what that's like myself.<br><br>Things I liked:<br>1)Creating the map together.<br><br>It's kinda a really big deal. We never did use all of the map, and I expect that doing so and modifying/changing/solidifying the map is an important pat of long-term play.<br><br>1a) The map doesn't need to be islands. It just needs to be island-like.<br>I played one game set in the asteroid belt with space stations, and another set in a steam-punk Antarctica. I haven't tried it, but I've posited that it could easily also be an "archipelago" of social groups (high school drama) or small groups ( I'd love to do one set in Occupied WW2 France, with the islands being different flavors of Resistance organizations, SOE, OSS, etc).<br><br>2) Destiny Points<br/><br/>These things really hum, and give the group something solid to work towards. It's also a great way of cross-communicating ideas.<br/><br/>3) Ownership of setting elements<br/>OMG! Such a very big deal, along with the veto ( although, when we played, we allowed a majority override of veto powers). It really splits up traditional GM powers as guardian of setting integrity in a good way. This may well be A2's greatest novel contribution to SGs/RPGs.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like/need smoothing out/more advice needed<br/><br/>1) Sometimes secondary characters start to become more interesting than the "real" characters<br/>There isn't really a good way built in to deal with this right now, since the game is designed to focus on the PCs, but everyone is taking up a kind of GM role creating and playing secondary characters/NPCs on the fly.<br/><br/>Again, this may be a problem strictly with one-shots and not ongoing play, where secondary characters might well be allowed to bloom and eclipse the original characters.<br/><br/>2) Four players seems to be the sweet spot in numbers.<br/><br/>3) Like lots of indie games with high levels of player input on all levels, it helps to have someone take an initiator role and at least put some minimal constraints on the initial play set up.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be a hard-core setting design idea, but someone really has to offer out a few options initially to choose between and then flesh out. At minimum, they need to act as a facilitator to getting things going, especially where the general setting is concerned, so that other folks can grab it and start customizing it as a group.<br/><br/>4) At least in the one-shots I played, a good chunk of the initial map doesn't get used.<br/><br/>It's just sorta the nature of the thing. Events spiral inward towards a few locations and other setting+character elements, and naturally that seems to then dis-include other things. One again, longer term play probably deals better with this than one-shot play, since those initially ignored elements can then come into play.<br/><br/>5) Occasionally, the group may have to re-assign Ownership.<br/>Sometimes the Owned Setting element never actually comes up in any sort of controversy, since initial conversation really does gel the group's ideas about that element. Be prepared to switch ownership from uncontroversial alements to something more in need of a guiding vision.<br/><br/>Hunh. It looks like I have more complaints than I actually do by the numbers.<br/><br/>I hope I'm not giving a bad misimpression. I actually love A2 quite a bit, and really hope to see more games in a similar vein.<br/><br/>In many ways, it is indeed a co-operative game especially compared to other games. HOWEVER... it's  a game that challenges in a different sort of way, more in a , I dunno, <i>can you follow me?</i> kind of way.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311984/#Comment_311984" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T01:42:31+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  1:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>Hunh.

The procedures of play look like they don't help you get on the same page with regards to how the fiction and the game interact. I'm not sure I'm explaining myself very well, so how about an example? A game like D&amp;D clearly says, "The characters are the heroes of the story, unlikely to fail, and will grow from humble beginnings to great power as they fight against evil." A game like Dogs in the Vineyard clearly supports one form of play: fiction that's about characters struggling with the balance between imposing moral authority and the repercussions of using physical violence. <br/><br/>I'm guessing Destiny Points might be the game's Killer App in this sense, but are they enough? Those of you who have a lot of experience playing the game, what helps you get on the same page about what kind of story you're telling? Could you see it working just as well with a group of people who are less in-tune with each other, or is A2 a game that allowed players with certain skills the liberty to tell the stories they wanted to tell? I'd like to hear more about that. The text seems like it might be a little too open-ended in some ways (not unlike the PTA "Pitch"). What was it like for you and your friends?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312130/#Comment_312130" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T18:19:47+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  6:19PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Komradebob speaks the truth. I played in both of his games, plus several other sessions of my own in Gold Rush-era California and a post-apocalyptic Midwestern town. <br/><br/>In the past year or two, only Fiasco has stood up to the quality of Archipelago (I or II) for me. Surprisingly, even PTA doesn't give me the same sense of "story now" and especially the one-shot satisfaction.<br/><br/>Four players is good, but I like three players even better.<br/><br/>Collaboratively creating the setting, PCs, NPCs, setting elements and especially the destiny points is really satisfying. You can do it all in about 30-40 minutes. Which leaves 2-3 hours for running the session itself. There's no mechanics linked to the map, which unleashes you to create content that fits your story best.<br/><br/>Paul, you are correct about the Destiny Points being the real killer feature. They do require player buy-in, but really you can get this with a little discussion beforehand and leaving open the possibility of rewriting some of them if one player wrote in a style incongruent with the others. This happened in one game I played, and it was no big deal. I would say creating Destiny Points is more difficult than initial setup for Fiasco, but much easier than a pitch session in PTA.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>is A2 a game that allowed players with certain skills the liberty to tell the stories they wanted to tell?</blockquote>\nI see your point, but I haven't experienced that yet. And I've played with players who felt really comfortable coming up with content on the fly, and others who did not.<br/><br/>The Destiny Points really keep the story focused, because you don't need to worry about a player who is trying to pull the story in their own direction. You all know where your characters are headed. And thus you can spend your effort on making those stories align (and collide) in interesting ways.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>At least in the one-shots I played, a good chunk of the initial map doesn't get used.</blockquote>\nI see this as a benefit, actually. In the last (post-apocalyptic) session I played, we didn't use a good 1/4 of the map. And during the session wrap-up, everyone wanted to play again to see what was happening over there!<br/><br/>And I feel the same way about the NPCs who end up being interesting characters in their own right. I always want to swap PCs to control one of them in the next session and see what their story is like.<br/><br/>One part of the game that is difficult for some players is ownership of setting elements. It's important to scope these out so one person doesn't end up with one that never comes into play. And everyone needs to know that they can (and should) jump in and veto if that piece isn't matching their vision. It's an important part of the GM-full structure of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312156/#Comment_312156" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T22:44:55+00:00" title="February 10, 2011 10:44PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Destiny points are really hot, but Ownership is the really, really hot thing in my book.<br/><br/>Even though character immersionism isn't a big thing to me, setting immersion is, and Ownership really goes far towards providing a consistency of vision on each major element. It does it very simply and very elegantly.<br/><br/>For example, in the Steroid Colonies game Caesar_X and I played, I seem to recall three players, with Ownership over the following aspects: Technology ( especially regarding the look of things), Aliens, and Culture/Religion. Each one ended up being very important in the game, and haing one person to turn to for a consistent vision of each ( or, perhaps more accurately, who was willing to stake out some vision and then build ad hoc on it and accept the responsibility for it) helped immensely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313529/#Comment_313529" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T11:42:36+00:00" title="February 21, 2011 11:42AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ready to rock the drama tonight.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5096/5465389553_4e0273ded1.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313594/#Comment_313594" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T01:24:03+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  1:24AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my wife Annie and I just home from playing Venetian tragedy with Matthew (Nemomeme), out of that sexy, sexy box. And oh BOY did it rock!<br/><br/>I'll probably save the details for Bite-Sized AP, but I'll figure the fresh experience into answering John's questions.<br/><br/>So, <b>I've played</b> Archipelago I a time, and Archipelago II a time, that is, straight-up Archipelago II, in the "blank slate, make up your own story premise and characters" mode. I've played Mr. Morningstar's Archipelago "Hacks" with preloaded character and situation, twice now--first Love in the Time of Sei\xf0, and now Venetian Tragedy, both with Nemomeme.<br/><br/><b>What I liked:</b> on the base level, I really like the simple narrative principles that form the core of the rules. "More Detail," "Try it Differently," "I'd like to throw something in!" are all just ways of structuring the conversation, rather than mechanisms to wind up and watch go. It's very freeing, yet focused, and just the sort of rules that go down easy if you want to keep the Dream at the forefront and maintain narrative flow. The last couple of games I played, including tonight's Tragedy, were smoothed further by Willem Larsen's <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/new-techniques-for-archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">fluency techniques</a>, using hand signs to accompany or even replace the ritual phrases. This both provides a handy mnemonic for remembering the phrases (which helps them get used!), but also, once you're sufficiently comfortable with them, lets you interrupt and interject without breaking the flow as much.<br/><br/>I'll agree with Komradebob that Ownership is a great tool for getting and staying on the same page. It's an interesting way of dividing authority; usually such divisions are divided along character lines, but dividing on thematic or topical lines is neat because it means someone is always thinking about one particular aspect of play and getting it :right," so there's constant assessment and course correction. The only other game I know of that does this is Shock. By contrast, Destiny is cool but it feels sort of optional or "advanced technique" to me. It's possible to play without it, and before you're comfortable with the system it can be just one extra thing to keep watch on and possibly too much for a beginner.<br/><br/>The OTHER technique that helps same-page-ness is "Try a Different Way." The times I've seen Archipelago go off the rails into loopy narratation,m inconsistent tone and character portrayals, etc. have been games where TaDW has been under-used, or used clumsily. Do not underestimate this technique! It's not just an "emergency veto" like some games might have, where the goal is to not have to use it, but you do if you have to. It's actually really important to use it early and often, to make slight adjustments in tone or characterization, BEFORE things get so wildly disparate or gofy that the story is unsalvagable. And don't forget to say HOW you'd like it different: without that, you're just saying "jump through my hoops and guess what I'd like." WITH that clause intact, it's a great communication tool for fine-tuning.<br/><br/>So that's Archipelago "straight."<br/><br/>With the Morningstar scenarios, I really like the focus of the preset characters and situation; you read everything you need to know off a character card, complete with secrets, relationships, desires, and provocative questions, and you're able to jump right in to passionate play along dramatic vectors. The Scene Guide and Theme/Fate Guide duties help too; it means that while every player has their scene, there are in turn two other players who are involved in it, whether they play a character in it or not. it also strikes me as a great way to run Fate/Destiny; one person, NOT the character's player, has a Fate card, whether hidden or openly, and their sole job during the scene is to interject narration that drives the character twoard the Fate. We had great fun revealing Fates at the proper moment, after subtly pushing toward them all game, and seeing how perfectly horribly events had converged toward various dark destinies.<br/><br/>The preset scenarios are great for tone-setting too; the visual design and language of the cards are steeped in the proper aesthetic, and allows you to kind of drink it in. By the time I was done reading the public information on Lucia's card, I was already falling into her character voice, and just KNEW that I had to play her!<br/><br/>Annie had this comment after the game: "This is the first story game I've played as a one-shot that I felt was actually able to come to a satisfying conclusion in a single session without feeling rushed." So there's that!<br/><br/><b>What I didn't like:</b> I can only think of two things: first, without a strong fictional premise going in, you're kind of out to sea (NO PUN INTENDED, HAR) in straight Archipelago. It's the old "you can dlo ANYTHING" problem; tell someone to say anything, anything they want, and nine times out of ten they'll freeze. The straight Arcipelago games I've played in have been either bland, with no connection between characters and very little dramatic tension, or degenerated into the sillies. This is where I'm really in love with the "playset" approach to Archipelago material: it gives you the building blocks to put something awesome together. Absent that, I think I'll probably never get much out of Archipelago unless I think of a story idea FIRST, then think "Archipelago would work great with that!" Doing it the other way 'round seems to fall flat.<br/><br/>The second thing is a slight tendency for play to degenerate into talking ABOUT the fiction rather than playing out the fiction: telling, not showing. It usually doesn't go on too long, but I'm kind of allergic to that form of play, so even a little bit can grate. It's not like it takes over the whole game, though, just that sometimes in scene-setting this kind of table talk takes on some momentum and someone has to remember to start actually narrating actual stuff happening. The resolution cards can sometimes contribute to this; if you draw "YES BUT, only if a terrible secret is revealed," there often follows a discussion of just WHAT secret would be interesting, and who should reveal it, and so forth. Not a game-breaker, but a bit of friction for some people.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313607/#Comment_313607" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-22T06:08:30+00:00" title="February 22, 2011  6:08AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Joel, that was a fantastic break down.
