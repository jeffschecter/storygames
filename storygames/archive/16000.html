He has blocked her and the children from leaving the house, and sits in his chair, in the late morning, watching a dead TV screen while the children whimper in the dark and Gladys tries to gather her courage. He sips his glass of whiskey mechanically, only none of it enters his mouth.<br/><br/>"Honey? Do you want me to get you a cigarette?"<br/><br/>"Sure. It will be Time soon."

She grabs a bottle of liquor from the closet and smashes it across his head. He stands, takes it. Doesn't seem to notice. Looks at Gladys with no menace in his eyes and says, "It is Time.

There are all these converging vectors of pressure on our characters, and the tension of "what do you do?" is way more palpable than they have been in any other game I've been in, except for maybe Thor O's BW game. What do we act on? Loyalty? Morality? Greed? Fear?<br/><br/>We're bounty hunters who got caught up in a situation where our bounty was wanted by this corporation called Microzenith. And whatever, except Microzenith wanted her dead (she had some company secrets or something, we're still not sure). She'd holed up with some low-time gang in the undercity, and we had to figure out which way we go. The bounty was given to us by Barry, who we have a working relationship with and who hasn't done any wrong by us. So do we follow through? Tangling with the gang would be nasty. We're not incompetent but we're also just three bounty hunters with guns and there was at least a dozen of them. Or do we throw in with Microzenith? In this situation, they are the ones who have the monopoly on both money and power. However, there's a difference between turning someone in for a bounty and even killing them in the process, and turning someone over to a corporation that you absolutely KNOW is going to murder them once you turn them over.<br/><br/>It was a rough situation, and we were learning towards blowing off Barry to help this woman get off the planet, but then Microzenith weighed in and leaned on us. It's one thing to know that we're working in opposition to them, and another thing to know that THEY know. So we backed off with our hands in the air. After the gang leader got killed in a gunfight with Microzenith security shortly after our meeting with them, there was little to keep the bounty hunters around. They left, and felt shitty about it.<br/><br/>And I want to get at how the desperation and powerlessness of our characters made me feel and think more deeply about the decisions I've made in any game since Thor O's Burning Wheel game went on hiatus, but man it was awesome. Having our characters be like, "Man... I want to help this girl, <i>but I don't want to die,"</i> made me connect to them. They really were, at 1st level, just normal people with guns.<br/><br/>I'm unbelievably excited to advance to higher levels and see how that changes things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365170/#Comment_365170" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T23:56:26+00:00" title="March  4, 2012 11:56PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts at a con<br/><br/>The setting: Clearlake High, Clearlake, California<br/><br/>Susie the Chosen was a very christian girl who kept telling everyone she and her sister were monster slayers chosen by god.

The snows are weeks late.  Rumors float that they have been delayed by mandate of the Duke of Yu, who is hunting terrorists.<br/><br/>Kian Wei, foremost on the Duke of Yu's "Wanted" list, is heavily injured.  He is buried in a hay cart by his friends, fatigued and frostbitten.  His slave, burned and scarred by their last encounter with the Duke of Yu's assassins, buries himself against Kian Wei's body for warmth.<br/><br/>Once the group dodges the patrols and leaves the city for the forests in Wei, Yu-Chen decides to ditch the cart.  Moh Yen has purchased enough blankets and provisions to walk for a few days and find shelter, but he <i>knows</i> somehow that a blizzard will hit them before the end of the day.  Moh Yen and Yu-Chen support Kian Wei and they take heavy steps into the dusting of snow gathering at their ankles.<br/><br/>In a brief moment of sunshine in his bleak and short life, Kian Wei's slave is happy.  He follows behind them, wrapped in the thickness of extra layers, and those blankets trail like a cape, concealing the tracks of the others in one wide valley.<br/><br/>Xhenyu takes wing and finds the signs of a village a good march away from the Imperial Road, and they abandon the smooth surface of it for the forest and the underbrush.<br/><br/>Now they arrive, and the citizens accept them without question.  Kian Wei has the air and dignity of nobility, and that's all they need to know.  They are ushered into the main hall, where the fires have been redoubled.  They are greeted with some distance by a priestess, who asks the name to introduce them by to her chief.  Xhenyu blurts out a false name, and Kian Wei is too tired to struggle against Xhenyu's deceit.<br/><br/>Soon the Chief, Ai-Fen enters and supplicates himself.  He exchanges a few words with Kian Wei, which are so elegant that Ai-Fen commands his servants to make ready to leave the house to Kian Wei for the winter.  "I find I cannot sully this roof with the baseness of my presence while so noble a rest is needed."<br/><br/>Kian Wei is shamed by this generosity, and they all turn to Xhenyu and begin to fight in hushed tones about the situation, but it soon becomes obvious that the network of servants in the house have been only the thickness of walls of way, and that this house can hold no secrets...<br/><br/>[*edited because I initially put Kian Wei in a "hey" cart...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365798/#Comment_365798" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T20:34:44+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  8:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 5:04AM by Parthenia.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>MAID</b> <br/>First session. We (a skeleton crew of Monday Ladies Game Night) got through setting and char gen and a couple of scenes. Making character for this game is immensely fun. The players rolled dice for every detail. The GM (me) rolled dice for almost everything for the Master. And we got....<br/>It's the 1860's in the country of New Ghat, somewhere between Europe and Japan, and probably close to Turkey. We are at the Toblerone Estate, a yellow and sky blue palatial estate with an outdoor pool (and an alligator) and a torture room. The Master is a 12 year old boy named Crowley Valentine, a sickly, evil emporer with brown hair and gold eyes. His favorite maid type is a Lolita. Stress explosion: binge eating.<br/><br/>The maids: Amina, age 30, though she's been a vampire for 2 years. She's a sexy heroine with stalker damage who likes them young (due to a random event, she took this as a perversion). Her clothes are vermillion, her eyes blue, her hair is cream. Stress explosion: teasing. Maid roots: loyalty. Maid power: trespass. She did not make a very good first impression on the other maids, and Ahmad stole her underwear and fed them to the alligator because she insisted that she change into her uniform in his room. Ahmad wanted her to change in the labyrinth outside while Crowley took in the fresh air and drank his bitters (don't ask). She carries a knife. She redeemed herself with the master when he was attacked by ninjas. She killed one, saved Crowley, and completed her task of restocking and cleaning the torture chamber. <br/><br/>Ahmad, age 14. A sexy Lolita maid with elf ears and a spade tattooed on his chest (make way for the yaoi plot). His maid uniform is yellow, he has purple eyes, and red hair. Maid roots: admirer of maids. Stress explosion: gambling. Maid power: chance meeting. Weapon: pole arm. He doesn't like Amina very much, and was very disappointed when Crowley had him shadow the butler for the day. He is an admirer of maids, not butlers.<br/><br/>Nazar, age 16, is a cool Lolita maid. She's also a greedy runaway ninja who wears a sky blue uniform and has red eyes and sky blue hair. Maid roots: illegitimate child. We suspect she might be Crowley's half sister from back when Crowley's dad hung out in the ninja village. Stress explosion: complaining. Maid power: mockery. Weapons: vase/bottle/pot. She did a great job currying favor with Amina, but Crowley got a bit annoyed with her when he caught her trying to give Amina an ill-fitting uniform (or was that Ahmad?)<br/><br/>All the maids' uniforms are covered in blood from the ninja attack, and Amina has yet to replace her stolen underwear. So next session all the maids will take penalties on their rolls until their uniforms are clean and complete. On the plus side, all the maids managed to set aside their squabbles and work together to defend the master against the ninjas. Good for them. They all got 2 favor for their teamwork. Weird and fun, this game. It reads much more, um, risqu\xe9 than it really was. We couldn't stop laughing and referencing manga and anime with similar threads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365959/#Comment_365959" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T09:49:44+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:49AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A return to Jadeclaw (two sessions this week to make up for one missed)<br/><br/>Highlights include:<br/><br/>Kian Hwe (posing as Fai Chong) has his wounds cleaned and cared for by a priestess.  She commends him for receiving the best treatment that men can offer, but insists that he leave his recovery to the treatment of heaven.  Moh Yin is taken with Kian Hwe to "prepare themselves" for the evening feast, while the other four are left in the servant's quarters.<br/><br/>Further pushing the Class card, a Noble enters the house and does not introduce himself.  He sits by the main entryway, keeping the door open and peering out to search for another.  Yu-Chen (who is Venerable, old, and Course) does not take a liking to him, and when the Noble insists she draw her weapon or sheath her tongue, she disarms him.<br/><br/>His sword leaps from his hands and pierces the blanket of snow outside of the house, halting the approach of footfalls.  The light from the house only reveals the length of the robe and the quality of the shoes, not the identity of the approaching person.  The Noble says nothing and leaves.  The servants of the household explode with gossip.<br/><br/>Kian Hwe fails to notice the tears in the eyes of the priestess, who excuses herself before dinner.  He and Moh Yin are tended to by servants, but eat alone.  The other three seats at their table are obviously vacant.  When Moh Yin "tastes" Kian Hwe's food for him, the servants are baffled.  One of them particularly was set aside just for the task.  He returns to the kitchen and snatches food from the other servants.  There is little for them to eat, and Moh Yin's slight affects them even more.<br/><br/>Yu-Chen makes a gesture of not eating her share, but the servants are all too terrified to approach her.  The other player characters finish off her meal.<br/><br/>They spend the entirety of the night and the next day alone.  None of the villagers will approach.<br/><br/>[so much more, but I'll cut it short]<br/><br/>I'm excited because I'm progressing towards some heavy-handed class / race strife in this game.  Racism is an easier topic to swallow in an Anthropomorphic setting, and while at first I would expect players to play the race distinction for laughs, we've been playing long enough that they're looking beyond the easy stereotyping and analyzing what's going on more ethically.<br/><br/>Also, I'm running this village Dogs in the Vineyard style.  It's isolated; there are problems; the player characters will be approached to fix them; there are no "right" answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365979/#Comment_365979" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T10:31:04+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 10:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, thanks for posting.

We had some really great "next week on" action that drove our session. There was a car chase between the revenuer and the moonshiner, a flashback to Omaha beach, the emergence of an unexpected and perfidious love triangle, and a desperate hillbilly lawyering up. Plus a preacher got punched in the face and Humpy Wheeler started throwing his weight around. The thing I am loving about this show is the balance between law and right - both sides know very clearly what the other is up to, both sides use the same mechanic to soup up their cars, but ties of blood and honor were getting in the way until last night. Clinton's revenue agent needed raw meat, he couldn't give up kin or near-kin, and he threw much-loved Gopher McDowell to the Federal dogs. <br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/pta/dirt_r_map.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/pta/dirt_r_map.jpg" width="300"/></a><br/>Click to gigantize our r-map.

Sounds great.<br/><br/>My group is getting an Ars Magica game off the ground, and our covenant is actually based around the Library of Alexandria, which exists slightly outside of the normal world, in a manner we'll be exploring during play.  Most of the magi are European, and most of the grogs and companions are local, which also promises some exciting fireworks.  <br/><br/>This first session started off with our newly-arrived magi discovering that the ship bearing the rest of their personal effects and supplies ran aground and was sinking, throwing the Hermetics into a panic.  The djinni-summoning Ex Miscellenea abandoned all dignity and dove into the water to rescue the books, whilst the Bonisagan desperately applied Rego Herbam to try and tractor-beam the chests containing them to dry land.  <br/><br/>Communication difficulties also impaired the salvage effort, as none of the magi speak Arabic.  One of the grogs spoke Arabic and I think French, serving as translator-- but the magi on-scene don't speak French!  One of the companions speaks Arabic and Greek, but extremely archaic forms of both (he was trapped in the library after helping to sack it six hundred years ago)-- but that proved to be an advantage as three of the other four PCs present know Ancient Greek!  Much fun was had playing Telephone with terrible accents.  And then the mamluks showed up to claim right of salvage and started firing arrows at us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366238/#Comment_366238" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T09:37:55+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  9:37AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard Fall 1153 (last session before Winter Session)<br/><br/>The mission was pretty simple; travel to Wildseed for Mortenharvest, represent the guard at the first night of the festival and return with the grain surplus to Lockhaven. Things quickly turned chaotic with many failed rolls and twists and such. <br/><br/>a couple vignettes<br/>A tenderpaw drunkenly made out with a local reveler, <br/>The grim soldier mouse impressed one of Gwendolyn's comely guards with his expert weasel skinning skills, with sure boots to be knocked later in Lockhaven<br/>the Dreaded Cat Beast of Elmwood attacked the festival but was ensnared in the festival tent through the patrol's quick mobilization of the rabble and local militia, it was grim work putting it down...grim work indeed<br/>And then on the way back to Lockhaven they discovered that the Cat Beast appears to have been guided there with musks and trails by the Weasels incursion forces<br/><br/>But to me the highlight was the gift giving (traditional with Mortenharvest). I had everyone give a gift to the player to the right of them. Everyone spent a check in the players turn working towards a thoughtful gift! Gifts of baked bread, a spyglass, crafted pendants depicting heroic acts by members of the patrol, a cloak clasp made out of shrike talon and fine sheaths and belt for a set of daggers.

I wasn't sure if a two-player choose your own adventure could be creepy.  I am now quite, quite sure it can be.<br/><br/>I was the victim and my wife was the ghosts.<br/><br/>I was, of course, spelunking in the subbasement of an abandoned factory.  It was full of rotten and decaying items of daily life: dishes, clothes, toys, furniture, and so on.  Water dripped down heavily from the darkness above.  Several pools of rusty water had formed.  Behind some partitions were crude medical examination tables with straps to hold patients down.  There was an Allied propaganda poster from WWII on the wall.  I wandered into a padded room, beyond which was an observation room behind what was likely once a two-way mirror.  The water was almost gushing in here.  In the observation room there were drawers filled with finger bones, dried cartilage, finger nails and that's all I saw before I turned to leave.  But the door to the main room wouldn't open.  The handle was slick with condensation and would not turn, almost as if something on the other side were turning it in the other direction.  I put all my force into it and the door flew open, tossing me onto the floor.  Standing in the open doorway was a creature made of water.  By his dress it was clear he was a surgeon of some sort.  I stayed motionless on the ground as he walked past me and into the observation room. He sat down, drew out a clipboard and began to make the motions of note taking.  He had almost a bored expression.  I slowly arose and inched toward the door.  The ghost looked at me and gestured me into the center of the room. I bolted and made it back into the main room, slamming the door behind me.  I took off running in the direction I came and was stopped by two more ghostly figures, these both made out of an amber dimness.  It was a Japanese mother and her daughter holding hands.  The daughter's other hand was missing three fingers.  I tried to run, but was stopped by a tugging on my pant leg.  There was another amber figure, a boy, who could not lift himself up.  His legs had been somehow surgically tampered with. He raised his other hand and opened it to reveal a gun.  He turned his head and looked pointedly at the observation room and the creature I could only assume was still inside. I tried to grab the gun, but my hand went through both it and the boy.  He turned his piercing gaze to the other door in the room, the one leading to a supply closet, as if to say, "There, there is the real one."  He released his hold on me and I edged toward the supply closet.  Behind me, the boy dragged himself forward, his useless legs splashing in the increasingly deep water.  The sight of this and the thought of what had been done to the boy in life and the fact that he still had to suffer its effects in death was too much for me and I fell to my knees vomiting.  Now both the mother and daughter joined the son in looking longingly at the supply closet.  I picked myself up and stumbled to its door, wrenching it open.  Inside the closet, my flashlight beam began to fail.  The door closed behind me and water began to gush down from the ceiling.  Even as it drained through the cracks in the door, more and more rusty water came down, drowning me somewhere deep beneath the city.<br/><br/>Yeah, it was creepy.  I am unsure how I feel about the ending.  The MC turned to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2325&amp;Mode=like">#25</a> (for those who know the game) and as this ghost was clearly a victim of violence, she was directed to have it kill me.  Did it make sense?  Only if having me go into the supply closet was some sort of elaborate trap, which maybe it was. Well, one of the conditions of winning is leaving troubling questions unanswered and I guess we did that.  I know we definitely scared ourselves  I felt my heart rate rise in several scenes.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I love the resolution system.  I got to use it in the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16079&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Elmer Sapp</a> game, and it's just as great here.  It provides for a nice cycle of success, success with pain and abject failure.

JW's spotlight episode; his issue is "Shame", so we open with wayward wanton Wendy, sister of his friend Earl and girlfriend of his cousin Auburn, coming out to the still to seduce him. She wants to know all about his war injury (a leg amputated below the knee), because she knows that's the weak point that will break him to her will. This was the moment we found out that Wendy is evil. He got it at Normandy cowering on the shingle, protecting Earl while Auburn did hero stuff. He never fired a shot in anger. Somehow JW talks through it and resists Wendy's drunken advances and whaddya know, by the end of the episode he's resolved his Issue, a new man with a dangerous new agenda.<br><br>Something else really interesting happened - we were down a player, a planned absence, and that guy's spotlight episode is next week.

Plunge Bob is also human. Quazzar is a winged horse with two brains. Chump is a huge mutated rabbit with armored plates and telekentic powers. They are off to the world of the gods to bring back an artifact and thus enter full adulthood as members of the tribe.<br/><br/>In the frozen mud plain beneath the 120' tall pile of shopping cards, Clyde-Bob convinces the lord of the chameleon crow people to become his vassal and sets up a potentially lucrative scrap metal mining operation. He then convinces a working domestic robot to become his personal chef.<br/><br/>Plunge-Bob and Quazzar penetrate the lost medical facility beyond the great radioactive slag aqueduct, defeat the security lockdown, decipher the mutagenic purge chamber, and transform Plunge-Bob into a genetically perfect specific of humanity.<br/><br/>Chump investigates the complex of endless apartment units, narrowly defeats the massive armored badger, and finds a functioning laser rifle for her new toy.<br/><br/>Of course when they returned with their artifacts, they found the ancient teleport device that brought them here un-powered and in need of repair--the likely focus of their next adventure.<br/><br/>This game is rife with weirdness and coolness in equal amounts. Every character had ample opportunity to be killed horribly, but they all pulled through and garnered great rewards in the process. The characters were set upon by a flock of possessive crow-folk almost instantly, causing them to immediately split up, which was a source of much interest.<br/><br/>The ability of humans to gain mutants as followers was exceptionally weird in play, as one Clyde-Bob set himself up as a combination slave lord and CEO. Unsurprisingly, this capability sets up instant human-mutant racism as a built-in function of the setting. Also unsurprisingly, the human PCs immediately used this ability on the mutant PCs and used them as riding animals. We just went with it, as this was already set up to be a very wacky, crazy game with more than a touch of satire involved. I think figuring out what to do with this setting element is a big issue with this game.<br/><br/>EDIT: posted up the AW hack we used to play this here: <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2439.0" rel="nofollow">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2439.0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368120/#Comment_368120" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T10:41:39+00:00" title="March 16, 2012 10:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World, third session.

In a four-hour accelerated mini-quest they found clues, used them to find macguffins, and used the macguffins to take down the Wraith Lord in a climatic battle, leading an army of skeletons, an army of animals and an army of men &amp; elves vs an army of wraiths and an army of trolls, all to the sound of heavy metal.<br/><br/>And they want to play again next week!

It was probably the least overtly violent of any of the sessions I've played. The soldier was a woman, brought back from the dead by a scientist in the Victorian era. Instead of hands she had long, sharp claws. He mainly paraded her around, showing her off to members of the local scientific community to gain esteem. Then the stablehand of her family kidnapped her and was travelling back to the family estate when they were intercepted by police. Upon being returned to the the scientist, he was enraged and jealous, convinced that she had slept with the stablehand, so he commanded her to kill him. She went to the jail where he was being held and as he walked towards the bars she reached out with her hands and slashed him. He was left screaming with his skin in ribbons as the police came upon her, and she ran.<br/><br/>She and the scientist fled the country and took shelter in a manor, where he used her to acquire wealth to fund their new lives by murdering moneylenders. In the end, he put his life of science behind him and began courting high ranking women in the community. After a potentially embarassing encounter where she came out of the wing that he allowed her to roam in and came upon him and one of the women he was courting, he shackled her into a bedroom and then sealed off the room. She laid there in the darkness, chained up, occasionally hearing the sounds of children in the house, and then after that nothing.<br/><br/>The end!<br/><br/>It was really great. It seemed like the third in a horror movie franchise that's the prequel movie. We now want to go back and play the original movie that involves someone in the present day finding the sealed off room and finding her, and what happens next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368444/#Comment_368444" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-19T08:16:02+00:00" title="March 19, 2012  8:16AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Labyrinth Lord<br/>Three adventurers make their way from Verbobonc to Hommlet searching for the Temple of Elemental Evil.  En route to the Moat House rumored to be linked to the Temple, the heroes are raided by slavers.  The heroes turn the tables on the raiders, defeating the attackers and capturing one.  He is promised his life in exchange for information and good behavior.  Using the slaver as a prop--manacled and chained as a slave himself, the adventurers approach the Moat House.  They call out 'Uphold Tyr's Justice'--the running password admitted to by the slaver--as they do.  The Moat House is eerily empty; then, in the Great Hall, the cultists spring their trap!  Cultists launch crossbow bolts and javelins at the party.  Men-at-arms emerge with polearms and attack!  The captive slaver is in front, though, and he bears the brunt of the barrage.  The merciless cultists cut him down.  The slaver gets no reward for tricking the heroes into revealing themselves with the false password, giving the cultists time to set up their ambush.

But it's done and I'm going to be printing it up soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368700/#Comment_368700" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T17:27:16+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  5:27PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played PSI*RUN via Google Hangouts with DavidTC (GM) and UserClone (Leo). I was Ethan.<br/><br/>Ethan and Leo are two sandy blond haired boys in matching gray jumpsuits with weird, inverted teardrop logos surrounded by the circle+slash symbol.  They come to inside a cargo container on a transport barge in the Bosphorous.  As it crashes.  Well, it is PSI*RUN.  We make our way out, manage to make things worse by pissing off some Turkish policemen, then further manage to make things worse by dropping part of a cliff down on them after Ethan gets shot while trying to use his telekinesis.  Whoops.<br/><br/>One carjack later and we\u2019re in a Berlin gas station.  How the fuck did we make it to Berlin?! We change out of our jumpsuits into some Japanese tourists\u2019 clothes and decide the cowboy hats might not help us blend in.  Oh, well.  Note: this is the only location in which Ethan did not accidentally kill anyone.  Later, the men in gray suits will come and kill the gas station attendant, but this was only tangentially Ethan\u2019s fault.  The police that died in the car crash with the 18-wheeler were Leo\u2019s fault.<br/><br/>We hole up inside a seedy motel.  While going through the tourists\u2019 luggage we notice a pamphlet with the same insignia as was on our jumpsuits.  Turns out it\u2019s for Enercon, a large energy consortium.  Why would they be putting teenage boys in cargo containers?  Their nearest office is in Berlin, but we don\u2019t feel like Berlin is a good place for us right now.  We decide to head to London, instead.  Of course that means we need\u2026<br/><br/>\u2026passports, like the kind Al in the dark alley sells.  Unfortunately, when we try to force him to do a rush job we end up killing all his hired goons and accidentally breaking Al\u2019s nose.  This reminds Leo of the time he accidentally broke the nose of the bully of his school back in Iowa.  Things don\u2019t seem to go how he wants, but they do seem to go how he needs. Well, unless he needs the cops not to come storming in.  Turns out this was the day that the police had decided to stakeout Al\u2019s operation.  Ethan tries to distract them and ends up killing several in a whirlwind of broken glass.   Whoops.  At least we managed to grab some passports.  And Al didn\u2019t even die!  At least not until the men in the gray suits arrived.<br/><br/>Ethan and Leo make it to the Enercon HQ in London and bamboozle their way to the 52nd floor (it\u2019s divisible by 13) and barge into Charles Montgomery\u2019s office.  Montgomery is livid and demands to know who we are.  Ethan answers \u201cEthan Jenks,\u201d just as Leo answers \u201cLeo Jenks.\u201d  They look at each other quizzically.  What did he just say?  Montgomery is confrontational, until Leo shows him the insignia cut out from his jumpsuit.  He then falls to the floor begging for his life.  Turns out that logo isn\u2019t for Enercon, it\u2019s for the Black Hand, a terrorist agency dedicated to destroying Enercon.  Why, they only recently blew up one of their boats in Turkey\u2026  wait, what?  And why does Montgomery have a list with our names on it, and every on the list has the same surname of Jenks.  No time to ponder these mysteries, there\u2019s two men in gray suits busting threw the plate glass windows.  They want to disappear us.  Ethan attacks and shit gets real.  He levels the building, but that doesn\u2019t kill the gray suits.  They capture both him and Leo.<br/><br/>The camera pans to Leo.   We\u2019re not sure where he is, because the scene is interior.  He is Lost (capital L) in the jungles of his own mind.<br/><br/>The camera finds Ethan.  He has come to realize, not irrationally, that he is the monstrous result of genetic experimentation and is not fit to be in human company.  As the camera pans out he is being fitted for his own gray suit\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368707/#Comment_368707" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-20T17:58:13+00:00" title="March 20, 2012  5:58PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Psi*Run 1]Damn, wish my stupid hotel internet hadn't cut out just as you were starting Ethan's crossroads. I REALLY liked Psi*Run, but I felt that I may have been eating up too much spotlight time. Perhaps consequently, the parts that got me the most stoked were the ones where Keith (Ethan) got to describe Leo's memories coming back. I almost can't imagine enjoying answering my own question (Czege Principle, or close to it?), so it's great that for a middle-high result, I can get my buddy to come up with something even cooler! Also, it was really sweet when right after Keith narrated my memories of being raised in "the institute" amongst all of my fellow clones, David (the GM) narrates the chasers, two mysterious men in gray suits, smashing into Montgomery's office through the plate glass window, coming down off of a black helicopter...and then says, "and they both look just like you." I immediately got the feeling that he had just made that part up on the spot, which was immediately followed by the feeling that that was fucking AWESOME. Good thinking, David, and I think this is what Graham Walmsley was talking about in <i>Play Unsafe</i> when he was saying "be obvious." David's obvious was my awesome. Technical difficulties aside, a great time had by all, I'd say.

I sorta ran out of cards there were so many conflicts.<br/><br/>We ended things with a climactic race at the North Wilkesboro Speedway, tying in JW's play for Wendy as Auburn and Earl Jr. raced tooth and nail around the dirt curves.<br/><br/>If Earl Jr. won, he'd get his kid back, and JW would have enough money to become moonshine kingpin of Wilkes county. Auburn didn't care about winning - he wanted Earl to win - but he wanted to keep it together and win Wendy's heart. <br/><br/>The cards betrayed! Earl Jr. lost (but he lost to Gober Sosebee and there is honor in that), he and Auburn wrecked, and in the end Wendy walked away from both boys. it was a downer ending for the season that left open lots and lots of cool stuff for season two. I established Humpy Wheeler as a major force in racing as well, so season 2 will probably move to paved tracks and faster rides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370095/#Comment_370095" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T19:34:53+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  7:34PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2012 7:35PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will season 2 still be called DIRT, then, or are you upgrading to BLACKTOP or ASPHALT?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370117/#Comment_370117" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-30T03:22:48+00:00" title="March 30, 2012  3:22AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The elder sacrifices his spirit cloak to the flames of the Sun, growing in the world navel, and calls upon his knowledge of the five and fifty constellations, talking to each in turn cajoling them to continue the struggle.  The Star Spirits are old, and tired, and no longer do the People venerate them as they once did.  The elder scoffs at this defeatism, noting that even though he himself is crippled and old, he continues to strive for that which is right.  The Star Spirits are heartened and vow to fight the Sun through eternity.  So, although the Sun grows strong, the Stars do not abandon Ganakagok.

Fearless and angry fourteen-year-old Dean moves around too much to make friends, but loves risking his neck. Rammed by the school bullies, he crashes off his bike and into a thickly forested valley, ravaged by a shaggy, titanic beast that tears apart homes and leaves new trees in its wake.<br/><br/>With the help of a polite bear named Otter in a checkered cap, he travels from the village of the toadstool drummers to the cliffside dwellings of the honey bears to a lake where skipping stones sound like chimes. When the beast's minions kidnap Otter, Dean breaks down, and his tears reveal a chest buried in the dirt: a helmet and gauntlets that make him as strong as the beast. He uses his new strength to confront the monsters and rescue his friend, only to learn that the beast has just been trying to collect the broken pieces to make a home for itself. Free, wild and mighty, Dean decides to stay in faerie forever and goes bounding off into his new life.<br/><br/>I played the Dark Faery and saw Matt and Joel get really lucky--no negative transformations on any of the cards! I've heard this game can go either toward <i>Labyrinth</i> or <i>Pan's Labyrinth,</i> but it was cool to play out a story that was genuinely this sweet and happy-ended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370255/#Comment_370255" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-31T08:48:19+00:00" title="March 31, 2012  8:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope with brand new story gamers at Emerald City Comic Con:<br/><br/>"What kind of history should we make?"<br/>"Let's do a zombie apocalypse!"<br/>"Cool!
