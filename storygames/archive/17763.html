Maybe the only real tinkering would involve handling the Darkest Self. Not sure what a non-monstrous version would be.<br/><br/>I've had inklings of using Monsterhearts to do a run inspired by anime like Beck, Paradise Kiss, and NaNa, with heavy mixes of yaoi and yuri.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402018/#Comment_402018" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T00:19:51+00:00" title="December 29, 2012 12:19AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno about MH, but I sure think AW's Operator could be a model.
