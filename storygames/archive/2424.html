                    Over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2414" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> ("What's the opposite of a Story Game?") the topic of culture has come up and started being discussed, particularly the differences between American and Scandinavian culture.<br/><br/>Brand provided a link (<a href="http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html</a>) to a site which lists a number of American cultural assumptions. It also has links to similar ones done for other cultures. I checked the New Zealand one; it's a pity there's no date on it, as I suspect, from a few of the entries, it's outdated (and thus reveals that some of what it's talking about is not quintessential to national identity but is just part of the transient cultural landscape).<br/><br/>But one of the things that isn't there, probably because the format was based on the American one, is a difference that I've noticed in my own game design. I've worked for Americans, and live with one, and I've noticed a big difference in approaches to authority. I think it's starting to shift for the Internet generation, but older Americans particularly often take a command-and-control, hierarchical approach as a given in any complex situation. New Zealanders (and Australians) tend much more to an egalitarian assumption.<br/><br/>(Actually, this is implied in one of the entries on Zompist. <br/><br/>American: "Once you're introduced to someone (well, besides the President and other lofty figures), you can call them by their first name."<br/><br/>New Zealand: "You call everyone by their first name, from the Prime Minister down."<br/><br/>But there's more to it than what you call people; it's a way of thinking about roles as much as about status.)<br/><br/>So - finally getting to the point - in my game designs I just <i>assume</i> that distributing the various forms of "GM authority" among all the members of the group is a natural thing to do, will work, and is a better arrangement on the whole than having one person who provides opposition, setting detail, overall plot direction and refereeing. A lot of the Americans here have also experimented with some form of distribution of GM authority, but the usual base assumption out of the gate still seems to be that there's a GM, even when it's not really clear why one is needed. This, I take it, is the natural result of living in a country where, if you have any group including a class of six-year-olds, the reflex is to elect a president.<br/><br/><b>READ THIS BIT BEFORE POSTING, PLEASE:</b><br/>I'm not really interested in getting into cultural squabbling here (I need hardly say), or the obvious naming of exceptions to generalizations. I'm more interested in asking the various people from many cultures on this forum: What alternative assumptions can you bring to RPG design from your culture(s) which will take it in interesting new directions?                </div>

                            Holy shit... some of this is right on for me:<br/>

<br/>
This is a wonderful idea for a thread.<br/>
<br/>
I have an intense distrust of bureaucracy, needless paperwork, putting ultimate power in 1 person's hands and I enjoy to have this be transparent and broken down into small bits. This seems to fall pretty much in line with my early Greek upbringing and I suspect it would affect my game design.                        </div>

                            Well, even without all the cultural stuff you brought up it would be damn hard to answer the question of what exactly are the new unexplored directions in RPG design... ;)<br>
<br>
As for smaller things, you can take the naming convention further. For example, in Russian there are two ways of saying "you": formal and informal. The informal one is for your close friends, relatives and internet buddies, and the formal one - for everyone else. (There's also a lot to be said about the names themselves, but it'd make my story too long). In Japan, when addressing people, you always use a suffix (if you're not, it counts as an empty suffix which is just plain rude). If you're Mike, I can call you Mike-san, your colleagues'd say Mike-kun, except for subordinates who'd call you Mike-sama, and so on.<br>
<br>
This leads to two things.<br>
<br/>
First, when playing in a Japanese-like setting (e.g., Rokugan), you have to keep track of which people you call with -kun and which with -sama, or you'd be killed for being impolite. This can be incorporated into the rpg system.<br/>
<br/>
Second, when playing in Russian (not in a Russian setting, I mind you, just when using Russian language for gaming) I subconsciously keep track of people I can call with impolite "you" and those whom I cannot. It's not just because I'm so stupid I can't beat the fact that in Victorial England there wasn't any difference, it's just that I have to talk (or write) in Russian, so I must make a decision on words usage.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            ÐŸÐ¾Ñ‡ÐµÐ¼Ð¾ Ñ‚Ñ‹ Ð¸ Ð½Ðµ Ð²Ñ‹?  :-)  That brings me back, it was one of the first phrases I learned in Russian way back when (not sure I spelled it right).<br/><br/>The Japanese page is interesting, but not really reflective of Japanese game design. However, on a more comical/casual level:<br/><br/>1) Most Japanese RPGs feature manga design.<br/>2) There are many more "cute" games, or "cuteness" in games. <br/>(I've seen many examples from various games where you'll have like a Warrior, a Wizard, a Hunter and a <b>Maid</b>)<br/>3) Many of FEAR's games uses explicit charts and graphs to show things like the flow of combat, the flow of conflict resolution, the 'proper' way to sit together and work at the table, ideas on how to explicitly focus on one player's character for a scene over others: In other words, very well-documented rules to prevent confusion, anxiety, etc in the social process.<br/>4) Some games award XP or in-game bonuses for creative or helpful endeavors, like drawing portraits or manga of the characters, writing up session notes, assisting the GM, preparing food/drinks, etc. Again, social lubricant.<br/><br/>Otherwise, many games are parroted or adopted from the West, with little change. So the "Japanese-ness" comes out at the corners of the game, you can't see it all at first.                        </div>
