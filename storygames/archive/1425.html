                    And these two separate concepts?  Or is one a proper superset of the other?<br/><br/>As has been raised in two other discussions now, literary conflicts consist of a character, who has a desire, and an obstacle that prevents him from achieving his desire.  A conflict of interest is where two characters have goals they're trying to achieve, and they're standing in each other's way.<br/><br/>If I say that the goals are the desires, and the characters are each other's obstacles, don't conflicts of interest simply fall into the concept of literary conflict?  As a side effect, I no longer have to worry about Characters being Furniture and vice versa, because that falls into literary conflict without such acrobatics.<br/><br/>Any issue with that analysis?                </div>

                            I think the issue is only really relevant when combined with the RPG specific question of what do the dice resolve?  Joe is trying to catch Bob.  That's the conflict of interest.  Now in the fiction there might be a fence between Joe and Bob which would be an obstacle to what Joe wants.  But in a conflict resolution system Joe shouldn't roll against the fence, he should roll against Bob with maybe a modifer because of the fence complication.  If Joe rolls against the fence it doesn't give us enough info to decide whether or not Joe catches Bob which is what we're interested in deciding.<br/>
<br/>
That's my only objection to using the term "obstacle."  There can be many many obstacles within a conflict of interest.  Some may be thwarted, some may cause set backs but dealing with each obstacle individually doesn't resolve the conflict as a whole.  A conflict to me is about when a character has a desire *and something is deliberately standing in his way.*  Not mearly passively being a problem or complication.<br/>

                            OK, so I wrote this whole post, then realized that the OP may be hung up on the word "interest." The way I read it, that means all sides of a given conflict have an interest - a desire - that's involved. That rules out furniture and Man vs. Environment conflicts. It's one of the reasons that I'm not sold on the phrase.<br/><br/>However, if you read "conflicts of interest" as "conflicts that pique one or more parties (read players) interested" - i.e player(s) finds *interesting*, that's a different matter entirely.<br/><br/>Mostly, I'm not sold on the phrase as it's not specific enough.                        </div>

Ron's post, at the time (it's pretty old), really really altered my entire thinking on this whole conflict thing.  It's short and not very detailed.  But I found it's core idea both shocking and refreshing.  Make of it what you will.<br/>

                            I think that's one of the things that Judson is trying to get at, Matthew.  If Conflicts of Interest is defined as both sides having a desire/interest, then many literary conflicts become Conflicts of Interest between characters.  (It also helps if you unhitch yourself from the PC/NPC divide, which is artificial, anyway.)<br/><br/>So Gandalf wants to escape and Saruman wants to keep him in his tower.  That is both a Conflict of Interest and a Literary Conflict.<br/><br/>If you redefine the Caradhras (the big snowy mountain they try to cross) and treat it as a character, it's the Fellowship versus Caradhras.  It's both a Conflict of Interest and a Literary Conflict.                        </div>

                            *goes to read post Jesse linked to*<br/><br/>Hey Ron?  Man vs Nature is a <em>theme</em>, not a conflict.  And it's a superset of themes, at that.  In which the representative-of-nature is, in structural terms, a character.  Which then participates in conflicts, sure.

What I'm suggesting is that the Venn circle for "Conflicts of interest between characters" falls entirely within the circle for literary conflicts, because what the characters want are <i>ipso facto</i> their desires, and the opposing character is their obstacle.<br/><br/>Logically I'm proposing this hypothesis: for every x, where x is a conflict of interest between characters, x is also a literary conflict.<br/><br/>Disproof is easy: present a single example where the hypothesis is false.

Not sure I see your example.  Either that's "the unwilling hero wants to just go about his life, but his conscience won't let him stay out of it" which is a literary conflict, or...<br/><br/>actually, I don't see how it could be a conflict of interest.                        </div>

                            Judson, I think it comes down to definition.<br><br>Conflict of Interest: two characters want (desire) mutually exclusive things.<br>Literary Conflict: character + desire + obstacle.<br><br/>When you equate the lit-crit obstacle with another character, yes, those two things become the same.<br/><br/>It's the equation of obstacle with character that is, I think, not always true.  I think it's often true, and I think in games, that equation is almost always the optimal solution for increasing fun at the table.  However, sometimes an obstacle isn't a character.  If you're writing some existential novel about the plight of the modern man against the tide of the uncaring world, the uncaring world probably isn't a character.  You <em>can</em> put a human face on the uncaring world -- the protagonist's boss, say -- but in doing so you're humanizing the obstacle and that may not be what you want to do for the purposes of your novel.  Sometimes life just sucks for the character, and he doesn't <em>get</em> a human face to put on his opposition, which only makes it suck harder.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not sure <em>The Mezzanine</em>, <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>, or <em>Waiting for Godot</em> are really models that we want to base games off of, but there are examples where Conflicts of Interest and Literary Conflicts do not overlap completely.<br/><br/>I am hard-pressed to think of an example appropriate for a game, however.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

In which case, believe it or not <strong>we are in complete agreement.</strong> No kidding!<br/><br/>I was specifically saying that conflicts of interest can always be expressed as literary conflicts, but not necessarily vice versa.  <br/><br/>That being established, I think there might be useful material to be mined from the idea of building a conflict resolution system around literary conflicts, which also imply a greater scope, rather than conflicts of interest.  Benefits that I see:
<ul>
<li>longer framing, and natural build up in conflicts</li>
<li>play to the "the conflict every scene thing is rough" crowd</li>
<li>a complete rout of the "Furniture, or Character?" problem</li>
<li>a resolution to part of the tripartite (or even tetrapartite) "conflict" semantic issue</li>
</ul>
Notice that I don't actually provide an idea for a mechanic here.  It's quite possible that "literary conflict" doesn't necessary demand a CR mechanic - but it might suggest a situation mechanic instead.  Or both.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite><br/>If you redefine the Caradhras (the big snowy mountain they try to cross) and treat it as a character, it's the Fellowship versus Caradhras. It's both a Conflict of Interest and a Literary Conflict.</blockquote>
It should be noted that in the book, Caradhras is treated as a being which has a malevolent will and is deliberately preventing the Fellowship from crossing. (In the movie, the snowstorm was caused by Saruman, if I recall correctly.)                        </div>
