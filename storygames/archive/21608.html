In my experience the majority of the rpg hobbyists are "casuals" who will show up when asked to, but won't take any responsibility for prepping, hosting or even learning the rules. That's just the nature of the hobby.<br/><br/>Regarding the hauling logistics, I'm a pretty big guy so it's not a problem for me to carry even the more extensive gaming sets around. Despite this, it's historically been common for me to end up hosting the games I run, just like others have hosted the games they've GMed. Having clear distinction between hosting and GMing has been an exception in my gaming history. The best hosting has nearly always come from GM hosts, too; they just care more about making the game session pleasant all around.<br/><br/>Nowadays the most reference-heavy games benefit greatly from digital sourcing, of course. I'd say that my old school D&amp;D pack would probably weight another 20 kgs if I tried to have the adventure backstock on paper. A hybrid approach is much more reasonable: print out the first-rank stuff that has a high probability of being needed in a given session, and rely on digital reference if you end up needing something else instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472695/#Comment_472695" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T09:57:58+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  9:57AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2018 10:47AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a frail old lady is what I am<br/>Do you use a laptop or tablet?

Like, my go-to device for digital tabletop game reference is an old Cybook Odyssey e-ink reader, a solution I do not recommend to anybody - an e-ink reader has its advantages, but for this purpose it's just a stupid choice that shows off how lazy I am about taking the digital dimension seriously. (Specifically, an e-ink reader is slower than a conventional laptop or tablet with a LCD display. This makes look-up and reference unnecessarily cumbersome.)<br/><br/>When handling other people's portable digital devices, I've come to conclude that a big tablet is likely to serve the GM's needs best. Get one of those tablet table stands and it doubles as a GM screen. I don't like a laptop as much, as it takes more table space and the keyboard is generally not useful for tabletop play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472700/#Comment_472700" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T10:47:13+00:00" title="April 22, 2018 10:47AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2018 10:49AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do only paper and pen at the moment -- I don't have a smartphone and I access story-games through an old DOS 386 with dialup -- but had thought it could be good to document some of the developments and revelations, hence keyboard                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472707/#Comment_472707" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T14:39:16+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  2:39PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like reading from e-readers so stick to old-fashioned paper books.

In my gaming life I usually GM'd but almost never hosted. I didn't even own the books for the most part, but I would learn them by heart faster than my gaming group. It's now when I do most of my gaming over voice chat that I have started to "host" in the sense that I organize the time, write session reports (for posterity and absent players) etc.<br/><br/>I think part of it ties into the ceremonial aspect of GMing. You don't necessarily care more than your players but you do take responsibility for leading the ritual, doling out responsibilities to the players and grounding people in the shared fictional space. I think this is why many traditionally focused roleplayers don't take to story games as easily, because many story games intentionally disrupt the ceremonial aspect, the narrative control becomes less "sacred and mystical" when everyone has it or some fixed algorithm sets the pace and boundaries instead of a ceremonial leader.<br/><br/>The insight of GM as ceremonial leader is taken from this post which I highly recommend:<br/><a href="http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.se/2017/12/on-dungeons-dragons-problem.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.se/2017/12/on-dungeons-dragons-problem.html</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472723/#Comment_472723" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T17:58:47+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  5:58PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my circles, the host is almost always the one with the best physical space for gaming.

To me this seems like a reasonable case to make: we might simply be observing a hobby where only few are capable of GMing, and those who are usually prefer to do it because it offers more for them to do. This would make it so that GMs are rare despite GMing being more fun than playing characters.<br/><br/>This is not dissimilar to the music hobby, by the way: those play who can, while those who can't just listen.<br/><br/>A gut check: how many non-GM gamers do you know who enjoy the rpg hobby more than the GM who enjoys it the least? I think that for me that number is probably zero over a longer time-frame. The most motivated non-GM I know is an occasional GM, in fact, even if not the primary one in his circles, and he's still only barely as motivated as the most frustrated and disillusioned GM I can think of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473460/#Comment_473460" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-07T18:36:00+00:00" title="May  7, 2018  6:36PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think that music analogy works great, but not in the way you think.<br/><br/>Most people listen to music because they don't CARE to learn an instrument, not because they can't.<br/><br/>I definitely know a couple of players who enjoy this hobby WAY MORE than several reluctant GMs in my circles.

Enjoying other's creativity and being creative yourself are two very different things!  And not everyone would enjoy performing in public, or even just creating and crafting and polishing and rehearsing a piece.<br/><br/>Bringing that back to GMing: it takes more effort to GM a game than to play a PC, and GMing puts you into a "brighter spotlight" than the rest of the players. People who enjoy GMing find that - usually - more rewarding, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it would be like that for everyone.<br/><br/>That said, learning to play an instrument is definitely a huge investment in time (and money), and some people <i>would</i> enjoy playing, but can't invest enough into learning.  So I don't think that the other argument is completely wrong, either.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473501/#Comment_473501" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T09:18:55+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  9:18AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tbh, I personally feel like GMing is way less work than playing a PC.

I believe you'd have more people running games if they didn't have to organize them too. <br/><br/>And the people who say they can't find a GM?

She has higher expectations, more of an idea of what to look forward to, and is keen to see the payoff on her work.<br/><br/>She might enjoy it a great deal, or she might just see it as hard work, but, either way, she's committed in a way players generally aren't.</p></div></blockquote>\nYeah, maybe I'm simplifying things too much.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474216/#Comment_474216" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-28T15:40:37+00:00" title="May 28, 2018  3:40PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2018 2:24PM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, this :  rule 1 of pretend play <br/><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=director+arrives+first+in+the+designated+pretend+play+area+or+is+first+to+suggest+engaging+plot+ideas%22+Joanne+M.Curran&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b" rel="nofollow">"1) a director arrives first in the designated pretend play area or is first to suggest engaging plot ideas" Joanne M.Curran JRCE volume 14, 1999<br/></a><br/>*Linked                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474326/#Comment_474326" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-31T12:57:43+00:00" title="May 31, 2018 12:57PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar with the reference, DeReel.<br/><br/>Do you have a link that expands on or explains the source of that quote?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
