I've done no significant balance considerations, and I've not played it. But I like what I have here well enough, and it's a complete package, so hey, figured I'd share.<br/><br/>Inspired by talking about superheroes and listening about superheroes and then reading and playing a very large game of Lasers &amp; Feelings and admiring the way the hyper-simplicity freed up the circumstances of the game. This game is not quite <i>that</i> simple, but it's still pretty loose.<br/>Here's the PDFs!<br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/klbgncj7x81znfa/Superlite%20Heroes%20v1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">This is the Rules Page.</a><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vb3yrcw5efu9sxp/Superlite%20Heroes%20Character%20Cards%20v1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">This is the Character Cards. It's one sheet split into four quarters, just cut along the lines.</a><br/><br/>I talked about the designing and intentions of the game on my blog, and also statted up like 1 and a  1/2 dozen major superheroes. <a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2013/09/new-game-ultralight-supers.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT POST.</a><br/><br/>What do you think? I'm probably not gonna make a whole thing out of this, but if the issues aren't, like, in the core of the game I might bother to fix it.<br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422024/#Comment_422024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T08:45:39+00:00" title="September 26, 2013  8:45AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's the core of something here. I love the quote you've taken as your starting point.<br/><br/>Cons: you'd need to run a few games to see how it would work out in play. How you'd play superman and the beast in the same game. I suspect you as GM know what you want and could get the result but is that down to you or the rules? There's obviously room for more perks etc.<br/><br/>Pros: making image and code as important as power. You might want to consider losing "life" or making it a stat like the others. A game where you can lose physical, moral OR prestige hit points might be interesting. You're out when you're dead, perceived to be a villain or ARE a villain.......<br/><br/>You've got me thinking......                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422136/#Comment_422136" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-28T02:04:24+00:00" title="September 28, 2013  2:04AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2013 2:04AM by Gwathdring.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool! There's definitely something in the middle of it. It doesn't immediately suggest a rhythm of play to me, though. That's certainly something you can impose especially when it's this light-weight, but it's always nice when the rules do that work for you. In any case, there's a cool core concept in here that's punching a bit below it's weight class. I think it could spruce up nicely if you do decide to come back to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422156/#Comment_422156" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-28T17:20:56+00:00" title="September 28, 2013  5:20PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to both of you! Some good ideas here. I'm backing away slightly from "more perks" as I like the idea that those with 3 in a stat get all of them, but there's definitely room for refining what those perks are. And that idea of various hit-point types is interesting...<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">@Gwathdring</a>: I agree that there isn't anything suggesting a rhythm of play. I certainly might come back to it; at the moment my other stuff, both game and school, is keepin' me busy. However, my friend (who actually knows comics, which may or may not be  a benefit) has expressed interest in building something out of it himself. His game tendencies are usually not as rules-lite as mine, but hey, maybe he'll have some cool stuff before I get back to this as a real project.<br/><br/>Makes me really happy to see that a thing I made in just a couple days (using a mechanic of my own rather than a hack, no less) seems to be on the right track.

Maybe it's tied to recovery?<br/>* When you take downtime, restore physical life.<br/>* When you live out your code, restore moral health.<br/>* When you take down the bad guys, restore reputation.<br/>The second and third lead into the first, but if they just stay down your reputation starts to get worse, and chances are your moral health degrades too as you ignore threats. There's also the reciprocal mechanic, which puts a bit more of the pacing in the GM's hands.<br/>* When you ignore evildoers and your code, lose moral health.<br/>* When people were hurt under your watch, lose reputation.<br/>(and of course, * when you get beaten up, lose physical)<br/>So you want to go fighting to heal your morality and reputation, and when fights are coming to you, you can't really ignore them.<br/><br/>This is a blunt instrument to get the players into conflicts. It also feels decently true to the genre. My mind's first jump was The Dark Knight Rises, were Batman was ignoring the evils and it was rending his morality apart (already kinda ripped up after Harvey), he got some back when he started the hunt again, but when he was broken he had to take downtime, and in the meantime bad stuff was happening and his general reputation shattered. But it IS a blunt tool, and is a little more about stomping on heroes neglecting their duties rather than rewarding those who actively pursue them.<br/><br/>Ideas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
