I've been working on this game for three years and it's been playtested to death. I'm really excited to be releasing it. <a href="http://theunstore.com/unstore/game/78" rel="nofollow">You can preorder it at the Unstore now</a>: it's $20 plus $7 shipping, anywhere in the world. <br/><br/><a href="http://theunstore.com/unstore/game/78" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/ATFM/Cover%20Big.JPG" width="300"/></a><br/><br/>It's a GMless game about murder in a 1930s country house. When you start the game, you have a relationship with every other character and you hold influence over them. As the game goes on, the relationships get more and more screwed up, until they become motives for murder.<br/><br/>There are some nice touches in the rules: for example, if your character is murdered, you get to play the Inspector, who comes in to solve the case. There are also the Die Circles, which give you extra dice if you're appropriately evil or victim-like. Here they are:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/ATFM/Die%20Circles.JPG"/><br/><br/>Brennen Reece and I have worked on the layout together (i.e. I showed him my original layout and he showed me how to do it better). Since it's a 1930s game, we've gone for an Art Deco look. Ask me sometime and I'll explain how we worked out the differences between British and American Art Deco. Here's a couple of pages.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/ATFM/Reasons%20To%20Dismiss.JPG" width="400"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/ATFM/Rolling%20Dice.JPG" width="400"/><br/><br/>It's a 126-page book. As well as the rules, there's a whole chunk of stuff about the English country house: the customs, technology, traditions and history. There's also a set of recipes, faithful to the period, ranging from Shepherd's Pie, through Kedgeree to A Cup Of Tea.<br/><br/>In another thread, I asked what people would like from a preorder. Bearing all that in mind, here's what you get for 20 dollars.\n<ul><li>The PDF, now.</li>\n<li>The book, later.</li>\n<li><i>If you order by Saturday</i>, I'll thank you in print, in the book. (This makes the book take a little longer, but you'll have the PDF straight away, so you can start playing.)</li>\n<li><i>If you're one of the first people to order</i>, I'll give you a murder mystery novel from my shelf. I've got a whole stack of them here, which I'll give away as the orders come in. There's no better way of learning about murder mysteries than reading the books. They're rather well-thumbed: they are, quite genuinely, from my bookshelf.</li>\n<li>A jar of homemade chutney, if there's any conceivable way I can get it to you. I can't post it, but if we're at the same convention or we can make some arrangement, the chutney is yours.*</li></ul>\nSo there you go. I'm proud of the game: it's come out really well. <a href="http://theunstore.com/unstore/game/78" rel="nofollow">You can preorder it at the Unstore</a>. I hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/><sup>* Although I will do my best to make the chutney nice, you eat it at your risk. If it poisons you, just think of it as fictionally appropriate.</sup> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269940/#Comment_269940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T15:32:39+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  3:32PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

After having played the game at just about every stage of development, I've been itching to get my hands on the final version.<br/><br/>I've been going off the idea of investigative games for several years now, and A Taste For Murder is one of only two games I can think of that can still make them fun for me (the other being InSpectres, for entirely different reasons).  For those who haven't played the game, you start out not knowing who the murderer is, but making sure that each character has a motive.  The inspector (played by the person whose character was murdered in the opening round of scenes) forces the suspects into revealing more and more about their motives for murder, until a couple of characters stand out as the obvious suspects, and then it's a showdown between them.  It captures the mood of a 1930s murder mystery nicely, but the steadily unravelling of secrets tends to make the game go to more overtly dark places than Agatha Christie would have dared.<br/><br/>One of the things that really endeared the game to me was how utterly British it is.  I haven't seen the explanations of British society of the time that Graham has written yet, but the guides in the main game text about how to use understatement and irony helped make for some flavourful play.  I also love the idea of rolling on the random weather table for every scene.  Of course, this being England, most scenes seem to take place in light drizzle.<br/><br/>Through playtests and various convention games, I must have played ATFM at least a half-dozen times, and it's never failed to deliver yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269968/#Comment_269968" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T17:10:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  5:10PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really fun game (or was when I playtested it; maybe Graham has managed to ruin it since) and I think it crosses a line that will make it enjoyable to non-gamers - it is simple, tightly focused, and full of creative twists and turns generated by the players themselves.

The premise is sufficiently mainstream to play the game with anyone who is familiar with boxed murder mysteries. <br/><br/>There is a nod to MLWM in the die circles. A brief discussion of tone is important before play, as the dark secrets escalate as a direct result of the system. I've enjoyed the two games I've played, and even our trad player came out of his shell to be an effective detective. <br/><br/>Graham is being far too generous in his pre-order offer, so take advantage while you can!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270021/#Comment_270021" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T03:56:21+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  3:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen will us tree-huggers be able to buy the PDF-only version, and how much will it cost us?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270023/#Comment_270023" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T04:27:36+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  4:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>the Penguin Classics'esque cover</blockquote>\nYeah, big ups for the cover, Graham.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270029/#Comment_270029" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T05:17:19+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  5:17AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can one fly with Chutney?

I really appreciate them. I am rather bowled over by the reaction.\n<blockquote>Graham, so how do you find out who's the murderer? And what narrative control do you have over it-- since no one knows who the murderer is until the final die roll, how does that work? Is everyone just equally suspicious-acting?</blockquote>\nSo here's how the game works. At the beginning, you have a relationship with every other character. For example: the relationship between Sir George and Felicity is <i>they are lovers</i>.<br/><br/>Then one of the characters dies. Everyone writes, on a piece of paper, the name of the character they want to die. Pick one at random. That's the victim. And, of course, everyone has a relationship with the victim.<br/><br/>Now, every time you investigate someone, you make their relationship with the victim more screwed up. For example: although Sir George and Felicity are lovers, <i>she is pregnant with somebody else's child</i>. You do that three times for each relationship. So, screwing that relationship up further: she is pregnant with somebody else's child and <i>the father is George's brother</i>. And, finally, screwing it up one last time: <i>George's brother is blackmailing Felicity about it</i>.<br/><br/>Once you've got a relationship that's been screwed up, three times you've got a motive for murder. When <i>two</i> people have a motive for murder, there's a final scene, in which they both protest their innocence. Finally, there's a big die roll, and that decides who actually did it.<br/><br/>So there you go. That's not the whole game (there's also the whole Influence mechanic), but it's the backbone of it. Although it's polite and English, it can push you into some really dark areas: in the example above, the father might be Felicity's brother rather than George's. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270063/#Comment_270063" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T09:31:32+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  9:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, how would you describe the replayability of this game?

The game thrives on the details you create at the table: the characters, their relationships and their motives for murder.

Changing the group mix helps: when John Stavropoulos played with our group, as the wayward American cousin, it really energised the game. <br/><br/>Another thing that helps is taking different roles. If, in every game, you play the Lord and I play the daughter, the game will feel the same. If we mix it up, adding a butler to the mix or a maiden aunt, it will feel new. <br/><br/>As Jason says, five is probably the sweet spot. I've played with seven or eight and it doesn't break, although I wouldn't recommend planning for that. It plays within three hours, usually.<br/><br/>If you've played the Shab Al-Hiri Roach, it feels like that. So there <i>is</i> a LARP-like element, but there's also a competitive, almost boardgamey element. And yet that competitive thing doesn't really matter: what matters is the story.

Thanks again for the quick delivery. Two questions:<br/><br/>1. Have you tried playing this game with your non-RP improv friends? If so, what have been your experiences? Any recommendations for doing so successfully? I'd love to introduce my improv crew to this game.<br/><br/>2. As a somewhat related issue, how does the game play for those with no background in taking narrative control (through improv or story games, etc.)? My wife and I have had middling success with Murder Mystery parties: they are either so structured the players feel like they are pulled along on strings or the opposite - so loose they're hard to follow, much less solve. I would love to try this as an alternative to those boxed games/kits but many of our friends don't fall into either of the imrov or RP camps. Yet they love dressing up and coming to the parties and aren't afraid to have a character.

In some ways, it's the most important thing. British people <i>instinctively</i> know how to play characters in a murder mystery, but the rest of the world tends not to.<br/><br/>So, the first thing is, read the instructions in the book. Here's a quick overview of the important points:<br/><br/><b>Be indirect</b><br/><br/>If you want your father to buy you a horse, don't immediately say: "Daddy, will you buy me a horse?". Similarly, if you want to fire someone, don't immediately say "You're fired".<br/><br/>Instead, start with small talk. "The roses are looking very beautiful, aren't, they?". Talk about other things, then gradually bring up the thing you want to talk about: "Daddy, my friend Sarah goes riding every day". <br/><br/>This is very British. It's rude to immediately say what you mean. Instead, hedge around the subject, then tentatively bring it up.<br/><br/><b>Play your idea of being British</b><br/><br/>You probably have a stereotype of being British in your head. Use it. It probably has a lot of truth in it.<br/><br/>Seth recorded his playtest, then sent it to me. Every time they <i>thought</i> they were playing an over-the-top stereotype, they were <i>actually</i> being very British.<br/><br/><b>Be polite</b><br/><br/>Imagine that, yesterday, someone attacked you with a red-hot poker. You're going to see them today at breakfast. What should you do?<br/><br/>The correct answer is:\n<ul><li>Go down to breakfast as usual</li>\n<li>Be polite to them</li>\n<li>Be slightly distant and tense around them</li>\n<li>Do passive-aggressive things. For example, when they ask you to pass the salt, bang it down in front of them.</li>\n<li>Under no circumstances mention the poker.</li></ul>\nAfter that, you slowly plot your revenge.<br/><br/>As for two players: I haven't tried it, but what you're suggesting would probably work. Give it a try.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271074/#Comment_271074" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T03:54:21+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  3:54AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Be Polite = The Elephant in the Room then?

I've just realised I left some questions unanswered.\n<blockquote>Well, this totally blows my own Agatha Christie game out of the water!</blockquote>\nIt really shouldn't! There are lots of ways to write a murder mystery game. I'd love to see another one.\n<blockquote>Graham, what sort of "British" are we defaulting to here? Southern, Northern, how about a Scotsman or someone from a more urban city?</blockquote>\nThe short answer is: Southern.<br/><br/>The longer answer is: an aristocratic family could come from anywhere in the United Kingdom. They could easily be from Scotland or the North of England: Scottish aristocrats would be fantastic, actually. If we're talking about stereotypes, however, you want an upper class stereotype. That's, arguably, closest to Southern English, as we perceive it today.<br/><br/>And they're country folk. They might own a house in a city. They might stay there for a while.  But they don't <i>live</i> there.\n<blockquote>I was part of that playtest. My character was a senior Bertie Wooster as done by Hugh Laurie. Still not over the top?</blockquote>\nNo, you were perfect. Every time your group thought you were overdoing it, you were doing it perfectly. Sometimes you'd say a phrase and laugh because it was so ridiculous, but it wasn't.\n<blockquote>So, this leaves me curious how American stereotypes work out in British gaming. In the interest of keeping things about your very cool game, how do you and your fellow Brits envision the "American Cousin" stereotype?</blockquote>\nWell, our American cousin was played by John Stavropoulos, when he came to visit. <br/><br/>But the American cousin is a rather wonderful stereotype. As seen through the lens of murder mysteries, Americans are: friendly, rich, modern, exciting, loud and exotic. It's a very affectiionate stereotype. They're the wayward family member you love.\n<blockquote>Ask me sometime and I'll explain how we worked out the differences between British and American Art Deco.</blockquote>\nHere is a rule of thumb I worked out for myself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_Moderne" rel="nofollow">Streamlining</a>, when used within an Art Deco layout, looks distinctly un-British. This is the style that uses parallel horizontal lines, giving an impression of speed, and is typified by the buildings in South Beach, Miami. I quickly realised that I couldn't use streamlining in the layout: it instantly says "Art Deco", but it also says "not at all British".<br/><br/>To get a vaguely British Art Deco style, then, I looked at <a href="http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/results/results.html?IXsearch=art+deco&amp;button=GO!" rel="nofollow">London Underground posters</a>. They've got a beautifully simple style. In particular, I found something I could use in place of parallel horizontal lines: zig-zags. They're incredibly dramatic (verging on ugly) and I found them used as borders in various posters. They're used a few times in A Taste For Murder.<br/><br/>So there you go. I've been dying to explain that last bit.<br/><br/>The books shipped from the States last Friday, so if everything goes to plan, I'll post them this week.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274772/#Comment_274772" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-06T17:33:15+00:00" title="June  6, 2010  5:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, congratulations Graham!<br/>The cover looks like my copy of <i>Keeping Poultry and Rabbits on Scraps</i>, without the dancing penguin.<img alt="image" src="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg305/nehrrld/415BGL9LWfL_SL500_AA300_.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
