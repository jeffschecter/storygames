The very best of all possible things.<br/><b>3 to 6</b>: Things are bad, very bad indeed.<br/><b>7 to 9</b>: The Worm Turns: An apparently good outcome which, in reality, presents a dark twist.<br/><b>10 to 12</b>: An excellent turn; a very pleasant surprise.<br/><b>13 to 15</b>: Utter catastrophe! Your darkest fear come to life.<br/></blockquote>\nThe way it works is like this:<br/><br/>Three players must each independently pick a number from 0 to 5, and then all reveal them at once.<br/><br/>In "As the Worm Turns...", we count to three and then hold up one hand, showing our choice from 0 fingers (closed fist) to 5 (open hand).<br/><br/>At the table, you could do it by sliding forward a die (6 counts as 0), or each taking six cards, for Ace through Five, and then another to show zero - perhaps a Joker, or that card which lists the copyright and trademark.<br/><br/>I'm now wondering whether and how this would work as a diceless randomizer for Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>The player and the MC would each secretly choose a number. So would a third player: perhaps it's the player with the highest Hx with the current character. Or maybe simply the player who's least involved in the game right now.<br/><br/>Once you have all three "votes", add them together, and apply the relevant stat.<br/><br/>The "critical hit" results only apply on a "natural" result of 2 or less/13 or more, just like natural 1's and 20's in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(You must keep them in play in order to keep players from choosing 5 all the time; I think their presence might lend a really fun tension to the "randomizer", as well.)<br/><br/>Anyone brave enough to try this in their next Apocalypse World game?<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441526/#Comment_441526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T03:52:28+00:00" title="January 15, 2015  3:52AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2015 3:52AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

Toyota hits a 7-9.<br/>1 - A total of 7, +2 is 9. Toyota hits on a 7-9.<br/>2 - A total of 8, +2 is 10. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>3 - A total of 9, +2 is 11. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>4 - A total of 10, +2 is 12. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>5 - A total of 11, +2 is 13. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/><br/>Looking good for Toyota!<br/><br/>But what if the MC had been feeling sadistic, and chose a 5?<br/><br/>Now, the third player's choices look like this:<br/><br/>0 - A total of 9, +2 for Hard, is 11. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>1 - A total of 10, +2 is 12. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>2 - A total of 11, +2 is 13. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>3 - A total of 12, +2 is 14. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>4 - A total of 13. Catastrophe! (Just like a miss, but the MC will probably choose a really Hard Move...)<br/>5 - A total of 14. Catastrophe!<br/><br/>However, what if the player had been feeling confident that the MC and other player would vote in Toyota's favour, and decided to go with a 3?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he was wrong, and the MC chose a 1.<br/><br/>Now, the third player's choices look like this:<br/><br/>0 - A total of 4, +2 for Hard, is 6. Toyota misses.<br/>1 - A total of 5, +2 is 7. Toyota hits on a 7-9.<br/>2 - A total of 6, +2 is 8. Toyota hits on a 7-9.<br/>3 - A total of 7, +2 is 9. Toyota hits on a 7-9.<br/>4 - A total of 8, +2 is 10. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/>5 - A total of 9, +2 is 11. Toyota hits on a 10+!<br/><br/>Hmmmm.<br/><br/>Two thoughts so far:<br/><br/>1. It might be more interesting for the player NOT to choose a number at all, so long as three other people are playing, or to roll a single die. I can't imagine too many players will choose low numbers (unless they have a negative stat, perhaps, and think the MC/other players are angling for a failure).<br/><br/>2. It might also be fun to make ANY 13+ a miss, not just natural 13+ results.<br/><br/>It's really hard to figure out how this will play out, since the odds don't matter: the players are making the decisions, and they can vote in their favoured direction no matter what. <br/><br/>Still, to get a purely subjective sense of outcomes, in this case (three hypothetical sets) we have 18 possible outcomes, which fall as follows:<br/><br/>Miss - 3/18<br/>7-9 - 5/18<br/>10+ - 10/18<br/><br/>(This doesn't represent the actual odds, of course.)<br/><br/>A little high for our intended scenario.<br/><br/>What if all 13+ results were a miss (not just natural 13+ outcomes)? Then it becomes:<br/><br/>Miss - 6/18<br/>7-9 - 5/18<br/>10+ - 7/18<br/><br/>Hmmmm.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is a brilliant idea or a terrible one... (which means it is likely neither).<br/><br/>But it's certainly a design direction I haven't seen before. It would be fun to try it in play to see what happens, I think.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441529/#Comment_441529" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T04:01:07+00:00" title="January 15, 2015  4:01AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2015 4:06AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CarpeGuitarrem:<br/><br/>First of all, you can't easily get 11 possible results (2-12) with any obvious subdivision of players.<br/><br/>Second, without the "reverse" option at the end of each scale, there is no fun to choosing numbers: you might as well always go for 0 or 5, depending on whether you want the character to succeed or fail.<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible that people will vote for a "middle" possibility, as well. But I can't imagine that the current player would: they would want to pick 5 all the time, which makes the whole thing much less interesting.<br/><br/>As would any other player who wishes the character to succeed...<br/><br/>You could try it, if you like!

In the end, the young heroes, the monster hunter and the knight freed the Witch and with her help defeated the court wizard and Prince Rickard, and lifted the curse.<br/>The giant helped in the final battle, ate Prince Rickard and his thunder-sword, but the court wizard escaped, setting us up for 'the revenge of the sorcerer', our next 'episode'.<br/><br/>The system worked really well, and my daughter sends you her congratulations for the simple yet effective story-telling tool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449002/#Comment_449002" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-12T20:10:30+00:00" title="October 12, 2015  8:10PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Davide!<br/><br/>What kinds of numbers of fingers did you tend to hold up?

Afterwards, she started to figure out that the 4 to 8 range offered better odds in the long run...<br/><br/>It went pretty well, but in general we had way more troubles and complications than successes.<br/><br/>We played all the game from the point of view of the two young heroes, but didn't "roll" only for actions, but also for reactions and in general long-term actions.<br/>I.e. we "rolled" to travel out of the village, or to see the reaction of the giant when they met him for the first time or if they could obtain the help of Prince Rickard (an ugly failure here became the base for kidnapping the Witch, etc)... and for standard conflicts.<br/>But yes, in general the point of view was the one of the heroes - it was not just "success" of their actions, but also if the world/NPCs/luck would turn in their favor.<br/><br/>Also, words like "miracle" or "disaster" sounded a bit too heavy, pushed things too much into twist after twist, especially when we had multiple "rolls" in the same scene... <br/>I simply watered it down when I felt that I wanted to keep on track rather than adding more exceptional details to the story.<br/>I guess the problem is that either the resolution mechanic is applied really sparsely, or if you zoom-in into the details of an event, an encounter, a conflict, then the same mechanic needs to be transformed into success, partial/at cost success, failure kind of thing... so that you can play the scene long enough...<br/><br/>(edited a bit for clarity)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449047/#Comment_449047" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-15T18:44:39+00:00" title="October 15, 2015  6:44PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, thanks! I like this approach, and it's probably what I would do myself - like in "As the Worm Turns...", the "Oracle" can be called into play at any time by any player.<br/><br/>I can see how, with only two players, the "extreme" results would appear more often. (They're very rare with three players.)<br/><br/>I would do one of the following:<br/><br/>a) Change the scale to...<br/><br/>0 - A miracle<br/>1-3<br/>4-6<br/>7-9<br/>10 - A disaster<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>b) Make sure you pick higher numbers. (Why did you or she go with 0 or 1 most of the time if you didn't want any "miracles"? A choice of 2 guarantees no miracle is possible, after all.)<br/><br/>It's a diceless mechanic. That means that if you're getting too many results you don't like, you should change the numbers you pick.<br/><br/>Thanks for the writeup! Very cool.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
