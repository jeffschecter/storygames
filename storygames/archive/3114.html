Is it a game for telling stories "about revolution and revolt"? Is it a game for telling stories "about the Southwest"? Is it a game for telling stories "about culture clash"? Is it a game for telling stories "about more technologically advanced people vs. more primitive people"? Is it a game for telling stories "about spirituality and religion"? Is it a game for telling stories, period?<br/><br/>I dunno how to answer those questions, or how I'd even know. But it seems to me to be important to the way I define and develop the game.<br/><br/>Should the game simply be "the Pueblo Revolt game" or should it "the game of (some other stuff) that uses the Pueblo Revolt as the default setting, but here's how to use it for other situations"?<br/><br/>Many other games have very specific settings as well -- Dogs, for example, is a game about a specific culture, but it's also about much more than that, and folks are always talking about adapting DitV to run other settings.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71087/#Comment_71087" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T10:36:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2007 10:37AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to make setting, system.  And any game worth its salt is more than the sum of its parts.  Horn tooting:<br/><br/>So Grey Ranks is wedded to an excruciatingly specific time and place, and you don't get a choice about that.  But you are supported systemically in exploring that very specific setting, even if you approach the game only knowing what your pals jack and shit told you about it.  And if you play it, and it does not expose more universal themes and issues than "we're fightin' Nazis!", I at least have failed.  Maybe you, too, who knows?<br/><br/>But I'm not about to spell it out, because it isn't my game once it is in your hands, and you can find your own things to explore, challenge, and experience.  So in your case, I'd go with the broadest topical description and let people find their own stuff in there.

It could easily be used for other Southwest Native American stories: use the same rules for post-Pueblo Revolution, except maybe add a transparent glass bead for more modern settings (don't know what it would symbolize at this point, but something related to the U.S., and it would be treated the same as the gold and silver beads.) For pre-Pueblo Revolution, don't use the silver or gold beads.</p>\n<p>Because of the bead and cord elements, I can't see this as being generalized the same way Dogs can be, because Dogs uses dice and words, which are more transportable across settings.

If you're asking whether it's cool to make a game that focuses on a very specific setting or situation, I'd say heck yeah. I've made entire games based on getting out of a single prison. I've proposed, in fact, that people may want to design games that are, essentially, single scenario games meant to be played once.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot at all unlike the "How to Host A Murder Mystery" sorts of games, if you want precedent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're asking me if I think that rules should strongly focus on the elements in the setting or situation that the game provides, I think they should. There should be no "lines" drawn by you between these things. That is, it's probably best if you make the rules such that they couldn't possibly be employed to play anything else. If you've reached that level, then you know your game has the potential to be focused enough to really capture players imaginations with the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you dissociate these things, I'll probably gravitate back to Hero System or GURPS to run the game. Or something else similartly generic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your question is what scope your rules as they stand best support, I'd turn the question around, and ask what is the vision you have for what game you want to make. If the rules don't support that vision, then I'd fix them until they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking briefly at what you have already, I'd say that you'd be best off making the game about the Pueblo Revolt of 1860. If it's worth playing once as such, it'll be worth a replay. That is, if there's more than one way in which the game can come out, more than one theme or winner or whatever, then it's got replay value. I don't think RPGs need replay value, actually, but if that's your worry, don't. Again, if a RPG is fun to play once, and doesn't have some spoiler at the end, it'll have replay value no matter how narrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71492/#Comment_71492" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T13:49:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  1:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Mike, and everyone else, that does help!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
