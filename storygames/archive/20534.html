While the full game doc is about 50 pages, there's a three page quick start in the very back that makes it easy to get started quickly. <br/><br/>I'd love to get a Story Games forum-playtest of Perseverant going. I'll serve as a facilitator of sorts, using one of the starting scenarios in the back of the book (rather than going through the process of creating 10 locations and 10 challenges for us). If you have an interest in playing as a character, just hop in at any time (just name your character and give them their appropriate Traits). <br/><br/>Ideally, I'd want the first few people to post to connect their characters to each other with relationship cards (per the rules), however that might be a bit funky to do so with a freeform group playtest like this. As such, try to connect yourself to one of the previous posters' characters the first time you post. <br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure if this will work, but, heck, what's the damage if it doesn't? Hope you enjoy. <b><a href="http://www.bendutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Perseverant-RPG-v0.5.pdf" rel="nofollow">Game document.</a></b><br/><hr/><br/><b>Basics of a character</b><br/>Each character is made up of four descriptive <b>traits</b><br/>1. History<br/>2. Method<br/>3. Ideals<br/>4. Drive<br/><br/>When posting, briefly list your four traits and any relationships to previous characters that you can think of. <br/><br/><b>Basic resolution</b><br/><br/>Describe how you're trying to overcome the challenge, noting up to three relevant "cards" (your Traits or Relationships). You roll 1+ the number of denoted cards d6. 4+ is a success. Success lowers the challenge's severity by an equal amount. You return cards to your hand for each success you rolled, and leave others out of your hand for each failure. Complete failure (no successes) elicits a Setback.<br/><br/><hr/>\n<h2><del>Giordio di Avenicci</del></h2>\n<i>Dead</i><br/><br/><hr/>\n<h1>Silk Road</h1>\n<i><br/>We are merchants, explorers, or missionaries taking the<br/>long journey from the Mediterranean to China</i><br/><br/><b>N\u200bATURE</b><br/>Central Asia\u200b: desolate Iranian Plateau, snowy Pamir<br/>Mountains, and the frigid Mongolian steppe.<br/><br/><b>E\u200bRA</b><br/>Mid to Late 13th Century\u200b: we possess no compass,<br/>only hand drawn maps, and clothes we made<br/>ourselves.<br/><br/><b>G\u200bOAL</b><br/>Reach Xinjiang\u200b: some for commerce, some for God.<br/><br/><b>L\u200bOCATIONS</b>\n<ol>1.

It is yours once more." <br/><br/>The sherpa knew that he could not answer Giordio's question without breaking his oath - he could not tell Giordio how he had bargained to exchange his life for that patrolman's. If he revealed this bargain, he would not be able to honour its terms or deliver Giordio to the Golden Horde. He would need to change the subject, and soon. <br/><br/>After another pause, the coins glinting in the candle-light on the floor of the tent, he continued:<br/><br/>"Perhaps I have led this expedition astray. If you truly believe this is my doing, then take this..." - Karshan held out his long curved knife, handle-first, to Giordio - "...and slit my throat. My blood will erase the debt."<br/><br/>For a time the two men looked into each other's eyes, each searching out the other. <br/><br/>"But if you are not ready to do so, here and now, then I will sheathe this blade and you will never speak to me in this way again."<br/></blockquote>\n<i>Since <b>Alhazren</b> has lost a good number of his cards, I'd like to offer him an opportunity here to join the scene (if he wishes to do so - he could, of course, just frame a new one, if he prefers).</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451447/#Comment_451447" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-19T15:34:19+00:00" title="February 19, 2016  3:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2016 3:35PM by bendutter.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Excellent development!

After many days of exhausting travel, icy wind whipping in their faces, fingers numbing with frostbite, they arrived at a craggy range of small hillocks and cairns. <br/><br/>The party carefully descended the rocks, praying that at its bottom it would open into a bountiful valley. A respite from the bitter cold and desiccating wind that had tormented them for nearly two months.<br/><br/>Instead, the rocks seemed to endlessly descend. A wet fog rolled in and concealed their path, and after several days and nights of careful shambling in the mist, they hit the bottom of a jagged canyon - boxed in by high stone walls on all sides. They had nowhere else to go but forward.<br/><br/>It wasn't long before the meddlesome men - led by the man with a curved sword and riding atop frothing camels - appeared at the mouth of the canyon. The company was boxed in, and they saw no option other than to confront the problem...</blockquote>\n<i>Feel free to act!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451623/#Comment_451623" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-24T16:36:40+00:00" title="February 24, 2016  4:36PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>I kind of wanted someone other than Giordio to act first, but I will if nobody else wants to today.

Beside him was Saverio, hand-picked for his skill as an archer. He looked across the canyon to a narrow ledge, where another handful of carefully-chosen men had scrambled, just out of sight, while the herders approached. There wasn't a lot of room, but it seemed that they had made it before they could be spotted, ducking out of sight, as the herders rode forward between them. Now the camels strode forward below them, with the riders, it seemed, oblivious to their presence.<br/><br/>While <b>di Avenicci</b> and <b>Alhazren</b> prepared to meet the herders head on, Karshan had taken advantage of this moment to prove himself a capable guide and acted decisively. He would not allow himself to fall into the hands of these barbarians, and he needed to prove himself to <b>di Avenicci</b> after their last disastrous encounter.<br/><br/>Karshan flashed the hand signal he had taught his counterpart on the other side, and both groups set some small stones tumbling down the sides. At the same time, the sherpa and his assistants made sinister war cries. The rumble of falling rock and the hoarse voices of the men echoed through the canyon, bouncing of wet stone and filling it with ominous discordant sound.<br/></blockquote>\n<i>I'm keying my Drive and my Relationship with Giordio, for a total of three dice.</i><br/><br/><i>(Rolled: 3d6.

The Venetian was still unconscious: not sitting against the stone, but propped up there with a stick, his arms behind his back, likely tied, and a blindfold around his face.<br/><br/>What had happened here? The herders and the company, both were gone, dead bodies all around. Alhazren's mind raced to understand his new circumstances. <i>Had they left him for dead? If so, was he the only one, or might there be other survivors lying facedown in the dust?Who had done that to di Avenicci?</i> <br/><br/>Looking around in confusion, beginning to feel the very first pangs of panic, Alhazren collected himself and tried to focus his senses. <i>Yes! I hear something - footsteps, soft voices! And not the harsh tongues of the herders, something more familiar. Or is that wishful thinnking? Not too far away, probably just around the bend! Though the canyon walls could make sounds carry deceptively far...</i> <br/><br/>But, in any case, they were receding quickly, and would soon disappear altogether. What was he to do?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Much of import had happened while Alhazren was unconscious. After both Giordio and Alhazren fell in the initial moments of the battle, <b>Karshan</b> leapt down into the fray and found himself face-to-face with the leader of the herders. A brief conversation between blows ensued. Not long thereafter, the two of them managed to quell the worst of the fighting.<br/><br/>Karshan had paid for the company's survival dearly: they left di Avenicci here, for the Golden Horde Patrol to find, with a sign from the herders. Although Karshan feared that the Patrol might hold it against him should they ever meet again - after all, such men might consider him to have broken their deal by not delivering di Avenicci to them himself - the chieftain of the herders had quickly understood how much favour it would bring his tribe with the Patrol. He took the company's horses and mules, cursed them all to die one last time, and let those of the company who remained go on their way, after sending a signal concerning his "offering" for the Patrolmen in his own fashion...</blockquote>\n<i>Clarifications:<br/><br/>* Karshan has Betrayed di Avenicci, fulfilling the earlier deal he made with the Patrol (albeit in a somewhat roundabout way that could risk offending them). He has 4 unkeyed cards, so that should be plenty to succeed in the challenge, and, as I understand it, he keeps all the cards in his hand. (Except for the two that are currently marked, which remain "on the table".)<br/><br/>* I wanted to leave various options open for you both, so you have interesting decisions to make, and also so we can see how the game handles a more complex situation. (Feel free to veto any of this, Ben!)<br/><br/>So here are the questions:<br/><br/>* What will Alhazren do? Will he try to rejoin the main group? Or will he try to stick with di Avenicci, which would effectively make the two of them the new "company", with Karshan an off-screen character or NPC (at least for the time being)? [If that happens, they could always meet some other traveler for me to rejoin play as a new character, or I can handle the challenges and locations, as Ben suggests for a defeated character in the rules.]<br/><br/>* What will Ben decide for di Avenicci? He could simply be dead or defeated (and we will find out about his fate later - or maybe never!), or he could try to contest the defeat by trying to rejoin the group. If he does, it becomes an internal contest, which could be interesting. (And I suppose Alhazren can still Help one or the other! Or is Helping only for challenges?)<br/><br/>I hope that's interesting to you both. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/></i><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bendutter" title="bendutter"><img alt="bendutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nIUA15RZGEM8B.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bendutter">bendutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451722/#Comment_451722" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-02T17:40:11+00:00" title="March  2, 2016  5:40PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2016 10:49PM by bendutter.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<del><i>Sorry Paul, I'm not seeing what you're saying.

Had it been there all along? Or was this a man come back from the afterlife, with a renewed lease on life and fire in his belly?<br/><br/>Either way, the answer was clear: this was a man the company could not afford to turn away.<br/><br/>"Welcome back, Alhazren. I thank the gods for sending you back to us out of death."<br/><br/>Karshan stood up and embraced him roughly, pressing the coins back into his hand.<br/><br/>"Keep <i>di Avenicci</i>'s gold. We're not in the city. Gold is heavy, and under the open sky, anything you can carry is yours by right."<br/><br/>Karshan thought a moment longer.<br/><br/>"Can you still mend the sick without your medical supplies?"<br/><br/>"I'll do what I can," replied Alhazren.<br/><br/>Karshan nodded. "We still have your old tent. Take mine tonight, I will raise yours under the stars while you rest."<br/><br/>And so the two were reunited.
