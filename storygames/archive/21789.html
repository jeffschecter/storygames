                    I haven't posted on here since 2014 apparently. I was an early follower of the forge and played a ton of story games a decade or so ago. I exited the hobby just as Apocalypse World was coming out (I playtested it a bit, along with Dungeon World). <br/><br/>Anyway, I find myself being drawn back into RPGs and looking for some advice. I primarily do board games with my regularly gaming group - I'm a freelance tabletop writer and work to keep up with the new releases - but I'm trying to mix an occasional RPG session back into things. I know my players are up for it.<br/><br/>I just snagged a copy of the WEG Star Wars 30th edition release, and I'm contemplating whether I should run this or the FFG system. Which support story gaming better? Any thoughts or tips on which system to choose or how to utilize them fully?<br/><br/>I'd be primarily running with bangs and doing minimal prep. Haven't checked out the FFG system yet, but if I ran D6 I'd probably try and utilize conflict resolution and lean away from task resolution. I don't see why that wouldn't work. Would perhaps add in a Burning Wheel-esque Belief system and have each player list a goal or two and steps towards achieving it.<br/><br/>But I'm torn. The FFG dice system looks gnarly (we dug WFRP 3rd). I've been spending way too much time reading forums/reviews of both systems and trying to decide which to go for.<br/><br/>If money is not a concern, what say you story-games?                </div>

                            I haven't tried D6 Star Wars, but I can vouch for the FFG system, especially the dice. They are specifically designed to facilitate narrative play, in that, even when there is a failure you can have positive side-effects, and negative ones with success, and any combination thereof. <br/><br/>Usually the GM will ask the players <i>how</i> that looks, and it's up to them to describe just how their missed shot gave their party an advantage against the enemy, or how they could butter up a senator while still creating a problem for themselves down the road. Personally I find it very engaging, and especially contrasted with the stark success/failure style of "roll over target number to win," keeps the players immersed and paying attention.<br/><br/>I think we've all been in DnD games where players are on their phones when it isn't their turn, which sucks. Obviously that can be as much about the players and GM as the game itself, but at least with the FFG system the players are encouraged to contribute to the narrative, as the ruleset itself is meant to mimic a Star Wars film in its pacing and atmosphere.                        </div>

                            I’m a big proponent of the FFG Star Wars system. I’ve been running an ongoing game in it and I think it works great for narrative play. Once you’re familiar with the symbol meanings, the dice system works really well, and, as mentioned above, getting lots of “success with disadvantages” or “failure with disadvantages” outcomes creates swings the narrative around in ways that *feel* very Star Wars. I also really like the back-and-forth created by the Light Side and Dark Side tokens, which players or the GM can flip to make unexpected things happen in the story.<br/><br/>My only real problem with the system is the skills list, which has some weird terminology overlaps. It’s sometimes hard to figure out which skill applies in a situation. But if you get one of the (I think very reasonably priced) beginner games, there’s a simple chart on the back of the rulebook.<br/><br/>In any event, I’d at least give it a shot. It creates cool narrative moments, gives players a lot of agency, and while there is a learning curve, it’s not an incredibly steep one.                        </div>
