I seem to remember that 2013 was more about choosing the life that lead to the character you wanted to play, and 2020 was more about getting bonuses and penalties and making up random stuff. <br/><br/>Linked to that, Artesia: Adventures in the Known Worlds. <br/><br/>With a system that grew right out of Cyberpunk, Artesia uses a similar kind of lifepath system. <br/><br/>The think I like about Artesia is that the lifepath system sets up all sorts of situations and complications, if you use it more or less straight. Any given character is likely to have family drama, with a brother than hates them and a sister that loves them but a father who is judging between the loving sister and the PC to see who gets the inheritance... It also does pretty well at setting up opening for PCs to link their backstories together through taking common contacts and events and using them in tandem. The game won't actually do this for you, but it does make it pretty damn easy to do it for itself. <br/><br/>Oh, Warhammer does suchlike things. But I've never actually played, so I'll leave it to others. <br/><br/>Pendragon has a similar thing where there is a long series of charts you can roll on to see what your father did -- and thus what things, traits, and enemies you will be inheriting. It has some of the same features of the other random-roll life paths (bonuses and penalties and interesting bits of background accruing) but does it in a way that focuses the game, from the start, on the fact that what you inherit -- the dynastic angle -- is often more important than your personal choices. After all your character, until inheritance, does nothing interesting and follows the same path as everyone else. But the legacy your father passes to you? That's golden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129960/#Comment_129960" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:03:37+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ones i can think of off the top of my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarhammer Fantasy Roleplay has a system of careers that works like an in-play lifepath, or if you stack a few careers on, like a lifepath.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe earliest of these would be Traveller with it's oft-lampooned chance of dying while traveling said lifepath.<br/>\n<br/>\nCyberpunk has been mentioned, and it always seemed that my characters were a lot older than the others because they usually had spent time in the joint and the service.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129961/#Comment_129961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:06:03+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay has a system of careers that works like an in-play lifepath, or if you stack a few careers on, like a lifepath.</blockquote>\nCould you tell me more about that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129964/#Comment_129964" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:17:05+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            sure, You start by choosing or randomly determining a career (there are some prerequisites) it comes with a number of numerical advances for your stats, some skills, some gear (called trappings) and a number of exits of other careers you can go to from there. If it's your first career you get all the skills and a free stat advance, then you pay 100 exp apiece for other stat advances, and you can jump careers by spending 100exp, once in the new career you have to pay 100exp for new skills from the list as well as stat advances.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were making characters that were further along the path we would give a number of exp in units of 100 to advance with. Hence 1000exp is ten advances, about enough to grab all the goodies from your first career and pick and choose one or two others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129966/#Comment_129966" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:23:18+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:23PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Twilight:2000 was my first experience with life paths.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129969/#Comment_129969" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:24:42+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Twilight:2000 was my first experience with life paths.</blockquote>\nHow did that work, Christian?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129971/#Comment_129971" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T12:32:17+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 12:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot about Twilight2000.

In addition to Heroes of Legend (fantasy), they had Modern Heroes and Heroes of Tomorrow.<br/><br/>You start by randomly determining your character's race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, etc.), culture of origin, social status, family of origin, birth order, and unusual circumstances regarding your birth.  While most characters generated by the system tended to be the human children of middle class crafts people of typical medieval societies, every once in awhile you'd roll up the odd half-dryad barbarian orphan that is secretly the result of a mad wizard's experiments in alchemy.<br/><br/>From there you then determined a handful of significant events of your characters childhood, which could range from making a few friends about town to watching your entire nation be destroyed by a vicious tyrant wizard who sold your family into slavery after marking you with a cursed brand.  As a result of what I would call  "good system design," the latter was actually more likely than the former.<br/><br/>From childhood you move into adolescence and finally young adulthood.  Characters can  train under wizards, acquire magical pets, sail around the world, be sold into slavery, fight in wars -- and recount the exact number of battles they fought in, who the enemy was, why they were fighting, whether they won or lost, and how great the casualties were, I mean this fucker gets into DETAILS.  When a character falls in love, it sends you on a table chase leading to a dozen more rolls, and by the end you know not only who your love was (in staggering detail if you want to run them through the system to), but if it ended, how it ended, what the highlights were, and how their family felt about it.<br/><br/>The final section deals with how all of these events affected your character, and uses a very simple and elegant system to tabulate your life experiences and generate a set of attitudes that matches what you've been through.  A character whose life is a never ending series of hardships and struggles, full of slavery and imprisonment, will be bitter, hard, and angry.  Another character might live in the lap of luxury and live a life full of exploration, adventure, good friends and greta loves,a nd come out of the experience a happy, generous, and well adjusted person.<br/><br/>The system is most fun, I think, when you walk in with no expectations at all and simply let it create a full character for you.  But you can easily steer the system, or just use the bits you want.  Like if you want to play a Thief, you might pick "Meet a Mentor" as a childhood event and select a Fagin type character, then have yourself sent to Prison where you'll gain skills and meet contacts and develop a reputation, then spend some time employed by Guild and learn even more.  Or if you want to play a Soldier, you might just use the military careers tables to find out how many battles your character fought in, and earn yourself a signature scar or two.<br/><br/>A quick search of the web shows that it is sadly out of print, and apparently hard to find.  I know I wouldn't let my copies go for less than a $100, they're simply too damn useful.  I'm pretty sure you could write the outline of novel using Heroes of Legend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129995/#Comment_129995" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T14:03:06+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  2:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2008 2:04PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I'd be happy to, but in what sense do you mean?</blockquote>\nA couple examples maybe of these lifepaths you're talking about?

It gives you skills, and sometimes some other advantage (like military rank). In Twilight 2000, you have to roll to see when you stop adding, so you never know how old your character is going to be. This is for character creation only.<br/><br/>The Fuzion system for R. Talsorian games - Cyberpunk 2020, Artesia, Mekton works like this: you make a few rolls for family background, ethnicity, etc and a few rolls to see what your childhood was like. Then for each year after age 16 or something, you roll for an event. Maybe you roll up a romance, a crippling injury, a friend or an enemy, maybe you get some cash. Keep going every year until you get to your character's age, then stop. Not much having to do with jobs or training, which you get from your "character class" and whatnot. Artesia's system is a bit more involved (actually its pretty OCD). This is also for character creation only.<br/><br/>Ogre described WHFRP - that career system continues during play. Dark Heresy is similar, but way more restricted - you have to stay within your character class - more of a leveling-up DnD feel.<br/><br/>I only have one Central Casting book. Man, would I love to get the others!

Each set (pair, treble, four-of-a-kind), that'll be a certain lifepath. For each solo (single-of-a-kind), there's some random event that happened to you.<br/><br/>So if you rolled 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7...<br/>Then you'd get the 3x2 Lifepath (Experienced Beggar I think?), and also the 2x2 Lifepath (Lowly Beggar),<br/>And the 2x3 Lifepath<br/>And a random event <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> (there are three lists of 10 numbered random events... so three different <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> events to pick from).<br/>And a random event <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> (same thing),<br/>and the 2x6 Lifepath,<br/>and the 2x7 Lifepath.<br/><br/>So, if you got a lifepath, you got all the earlier parts of that "chain" as well. If you had 5 two's, then you'd count the 2x2, the 3x2, the 4x2 and the 5x2.<br/><br/>It's a ton of fun to roll 11d10, and then be like "I was a Beggar Monarch and I own a Magnificent Garden! Rawk!"<br/><br/>You had the option to set aside any amount of those dice, automatically getting the results. So if Beggar Monarch sounds cool, I can set aside 5 one's, ensuring I get that.
