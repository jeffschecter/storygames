                    So, I've been watching altogether too much of a Les Miserables DVD (the musical), and I got to thinking about stage tragedies as a genre, and before long I'd worked up the following game.<br/><br/>I've been tinkering with it today, but I feel there's something missing, to really get the game to fizz and pop.<br/><br/><a href="http://meserach.livejournal.com/819.html" rel="nofollow">The Tragedy Game - first draft</a><br/><br/>Please take a look at it. All comments will be interesting.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm interested in the following:
<ol>
<li>Are players given compelling reasons to spend Life tokens to the point of death? If not, how can I encourage it (mechanically and/or narratively?)</li>
<li>Are players given compelling reasons to want to avoid Tragedy? If not, how should I encourage this?</li>
<li>Am I being too hard or too soft on the characters? Specifically, are dice lost too quickly, and is Consolation too difficult?</li>
<li>Should there be a means of regaining dice, or even regaining Life tokens? What should it be like?</li>
<li>How should I deal with characters with Causes in common?</li>
<li>How should I deal with characters with Causes that are directly opposed or mutually exclusive?</li>
<li>What further narrative structure should I impose? I think there needs to be some kind of opening prologue, in which people establish and demonstrate their Causes, so that there's actually something to care about when things get tragic.</li>
</ol>
Thank you for your time.                </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite><br/><br/>1. Are players given compelling reasons to spend Life tokens to the point of death? If not, how can I encourage it (mechanically and/or narratively?)</blockquote>
I think the chance of consolations is probably good enough.
<blockquote><br/>2. Are players given compelling reasons to want to avoid Tragedy? If not, how should I encourage this?</blockquote>
Um - you're encouraging them to avoid tragedy? I thought tragedy was what they were heading towards.
<blockquote><br/>3. Am I being too hard or too soft on the characters? Specifically, are dice lost too quickly, and is Consolation too difficult?</blockquote>
Probably only a playtest could answer this.
<blockquote>4. Should there be a means of regaining dice, or even regaining Life tokens? What should it be like?</blockquote>
Possibly attaining a Consolation should give you some dice back - or you could get one die after 2 consolations, and then 1 life token after 4 consolations. Something.
<blockquote><br/>5. How should I deal with characters with Causes in common?</blockquote>
Won't they naturally aid each other? Actually, I'm having a hard time seeing any mechanical encouragement for aiding. Were I you, I'd try to enable characters to work together for some joint gain where they have causes in common, and set up the initial choice of causes so that having joint causes is encouraged.
<blockquote>6. How should I deal with characters with Causes that are directly opposed or mutually exclusive?</blockquote>
Aren't they effectively in a race to achieve happiness in their causes - which invalidates the opposed cause?
<blockquote>7. What further narrative structure should I impose? I think there needs to be some kind of opening prologue, in which people establish and demonstrate their Causes, so that there's actually something to care about when things get tragic.</blockquote>
I think so too. Kind of like the opening aria that a character has in opera, that says who they are and what they're about.                        </div>

Yes, I hope so. 
<blockquote><br/>Um - you're encouraging them to avoid tragedy? I thought tragedy was what they were heading towards.<br/></blockquote>
Aha - I mean, that I want tragedy to actually feel bad. It's no good if player are blase about aquiring tragedy. I want it to hurt. The game mechanics should ensure that they won't be able to get away without any.
<blockquote><br/>Possibly attaining a Consolation should give you some dice back - or you could get one die after 2 consolations, and then 1 life token after 4 consolations. Something.</blockquote>
Could well be. It needs playtesting to work it out, really. But that is a fine idea.
<blockquote><br/>Actually, I'm having a hard time seeing any mechanical encouragement for aiding.<br/></blockquote>
Currently, the reasons to aid as opposed to keeping the dice for yourself, speaking purely on the mechanical level, are:<br/><br/>- You may have a vested interest in a character not dying, as it would negate one of your own Causes.<br/>- When you Aid, you get to roll the dice you're aiding with first, and then choose where to best deploy the result. In addition, you get to do this after the player's dice are rolled, so you have complete knowledge of where Tragedy will occur etc.<br/>- Aiding is the only way to bring another character out of Tragedy. Admittedly, there's no mechanical reasons at present to want to drag other players out of tragedy...<br/><br/>Obviously on the narrative level there might be a bunch of reasons.
<blockquote><br/> Were I you, I'd try to enable characters to work together for some joint gain where they have causes in common, and set up the initial choice of causes so that having joint causes is encouraged.<br/></blockquote>
This is a fine idea. i can think of a bunch of ways to implement that, so great.
<blockquote><blockquote>6. How should I deal with characters with Causes that are directly opposed or mutually exclusive?</blockquote>
Aren't they effectively in a race to achieve happiness in their causes - which invalidates the opposed cause?<br/></blockquote>
Yes, I suppose so. I was just wondering about having a more interesting mechanic for the interaction. But I guess if you just say that the first to Happiness invalidates the other person, that works out.
<blockquote>
<blockquote>7. What further narrative structure should I impose? I think there needs to be some kind of opening prologue, in which people establish and demonstrate their Causes, so that there's actually something to care about when things get tragic.</blockquote>
I think so too. Kind of like the opening aria that a character has in opera, that says who they are and what they're about.</blockquote>
It's funny you should mention opera - due to the Les Mis-based inspiration, I keep having to fight an impulse to put rules in saying the players have to sing.                        </div>

                            Have you read the original, unabridged Les Mis? I think you might get some gravy from the way Hugo merrily puts aside the story and zips down along political and financial tangents, like Lemony Snicket with an economics degree.<br/><br/>Edit: I also came up with a game in which people must sing, based on an rpg.net thread which started talking about 'game designers who don't play' and which included, absurdly, a discussion of Beethoven, so I decided I would write a game that Beethoven might have written. It was a supers game. I'll try to find a link.                        </div>

                            I haven't read the novel, no. I'm mostly interested in theatrical onventions, which is why the musical has caught my eye.<br/><br/>Partyl the thing was inspired to create an RPG that would really involve my girlfriend, who loves Les Miserables. She also loves tragic movies - you know the kind of thing, Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Cafe.<br/><br/>So I was just thinking that there weren't many games that directly shot for tragedy as the point of play. My Life WIth Master does. But other examples do not come readily to mind.<br/><br/>Much as I love Les Mis, I'm also hoping the game could do a good Shakesperean tragedy too. Perhaps I should get everyone to speak in iambic pentameter.                        </div>

                            Howdy.<br/><br/>I'd suggest checking out the excellent <a href="http://philippe.tromeur.free.fr/whrpg.htm" rel="nofollow">Wuthering Heights</a>. Its mechanics gleefully brutalize the characters in such a way that the players can't help enjoying, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Here's another thought, without actually having read your rules: Based on posts above, you seem to want Tragedy to squat in the middle of play, leering at characters, hoping to drag them in. That's cool, but then players are really working to <i>avoid</i> Tragedy, right? If so, well, it's not really a Tragedy in the dramatic sense. In dramatic Tragedies, it's understood that at least one person is going to die, and no one will survive unmarked.<br/><br/>It's been awhile since I saw <i>Les Mis</i>, but to use another musical theater example with which I'm more familiar, have you ever seen <i>Sweeny Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street</i>? Ain't no happiness at the end of that. Same with Shakespeare--- who's happy at the end of <i>Othello</i> or <i>Hamlet</i>? Not even Fortinbras, whose cause is furthered by the disarray and insanity in the Danish court! All are <i>marked</i>, which is probably the point in the minds of the Greek originators, since it was, in the beginning, about religion...<br/><br/>Anyway, you could set it up mechanically to make it inevitable that at least one character will die, as the center of the Tragedy itself (Valjean does die, right? I can't remember...) Others may live, may actually go on to live decent lives, but will always be marked by the Tragedy they witnessed (here the ending scenes of MLwM loom largely in my mind). I also can't help thinking that it'd be cool (in a Tragical sense!) if the <i>death</i> of those least marked/directly involved by/in the Tragedy helped to drive things along (in Hamlet I think of Ophelia, and even Rosencrantz and Guildenstern).<br/><br/>I have some other thoughts, but I think I need to read your text first. You got my brain going today; thanks!<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>

Hmm. I both agree and disagree with you.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the ganme are set up at the moment with the idea that most of the players are inevitably goign to die unless they play very selfishly or don't mind being utterly miserable. The mechanics (hiopefully) ensure that pretty much the only shot you have of gaining much significant happiness is to kill yourself before the game ends, or get someone else to die for you.<br/><br/>I want to encourage character identification in the game, and so i seems natiral to make Tragedy something you would liek to avoid but inevitably can't. I could structure the game so as to make Tragedy some how mechanically beneficial - he who has the most tragedy wins - but I'm concerned baout what that wpould do to identifcation. If the game <i>, mechanically speaking, coming up with ever more tragedy to pile upon your charcaters, it might slip more readily into melodrama and even comedy, as players compete to top each other and then top themselves as agonisiingly as possible.<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>So instead the game is less about accumulating tragedy but is instead about the small amount of <i>consolation</i> you can achieve in an environment of otherwise unremitting tragedy by default. It's the game of "OK, your life sucks, but you get one moment of beauty and happiness amongst it all. What is it?"<br/><br/>More later, in a hurry.</i> </div>
