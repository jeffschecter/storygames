Not sure if this has been done before, but It's a topic that is coming up in some of my games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually really like using D+D(3.x or 4e) as my testbed for any sort of scene framing exercises.  I think that everyone in my group has a really good baseline of how much fun and interest D+D is supposed to generate.  So if we change up scene framing, or even world concepts, we can pretty accurately measure what it did to the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like using Buffy to test prop stuff.  I think I would also like using PTA, but I don't own the system.  Using a TV-based game to test props, sound effects, theme songs, and even background music just makes tons of sense!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how about it?  Got any favorite games to test new ideas                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172100/#Comment_172100" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T09:23:03+00:00" title="September 30, 2008  9:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The utilitarian system I return to again and again is <i>Solar System</i>.  Hacking/tweaking Keys, Secrets and Abilities lets us tune it for a pretty wide range of effects.  It's easy to try out some new technique to see how it works, and since we play all the time, we know right away if it an improvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172118/#Comment_172118" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T11:00:29+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 11:00AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything Fudge-based is pretty good for this purpose, actually, since Fudge is a rules-light toolbox game if there ever was one.
