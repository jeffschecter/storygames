This was the biggest "writing" step, the step where we changed/shaped the raw play session the most.<br/>7) Establish the page production line: lettering &gt; foreground pencils &gt; background pencils &gt; inks &gt; colors.<br/>8) Assign each contributor one or more positions in the page production line.<br/>9) Go!<br/>10) Design and packaging.<br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412189/#Comment_412189" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T10:42:17+00:00" title="April 18, 2013 10:42AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, how did you decide who did what in the production line?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412241/#Comment_412241" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T19:11:50+00:00" title="April 18, 2013  7:11PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a matter of identifying the strengths of each participant and trying to put her or him in the best position to utilize those strengths.

I'd like to add a few:<br/><br/>When transcribing:<br/><br/>Did you literally type out every word said by every player?  Or every word other than out-of-game stuff ("I have to go to the bathroom") and abortive attempts ("My guy says, um, he says that, uh...")?</i></blockquote>\nThe instructions I gave were to turn the audio into a rough movie script during the transcription, so most of the hesitation and incidental chatter was cut at that point. Each transcriber turned in dialogue and stage directions, focused on what was said at the table and trying to edit as little as possible. So the term "transcription" may even be pushing it a little. \n<blockquote><i>What was your method to distinguish character speech from player speech?</i></blockquote>\nIt was purely up to the interpretation of the transcriber. But everyone at the table knew each other already, so they were familiar with each other's personalities and speech patterns, and each person finished his or her transcription within 48 hours, so the session was still fresh in their minds.\n<blockquote><i>When thumbnailing:<br/><br/>Was the working assumption re: balloon text "We'll use the unaltered character dialogue from the play recordings"?  Or did the contributors do things like, "Well, that went on forever in the recording, but the character really only made one point, so one bubble in a standard panel ought to suffice"?</i></blockquote>\nAs noted above, we tried to keep the first draft of the transcription as raw as possible within reason. Most of the kind of cutting you're describing in your second example happened when I made my first editorial pass on the transcriptions, at the end of which we had something much closer to a formatted film script. And it's great that you bring up the idea of what a "standard speech bubble" can hold, because that is a huge concern when writing for comics. A basic rule of thumb I teach is to try to limit dialogue to one sentence per balloon, editing to fit and/or structuring an entire scene around that limit.\n<blockquote><i>When editing:<br/><br/>What did you find most necessary in order to bridge the gap from play transcript to comic?  Removing scenes?  Removing parts of scenes?  Re-ordering scenes?  Adding material of any particular sort?</i></blockquote>\nThat's a hard one, but in thinking about it now I would say that, before I think about what to cut, I ask myself what the essential elements of the story are, and how to best retain/reinforce them over the course of the editing process. For this project, the primary concern was character: how do I retain the distinct personalities that emerged from the play session? This is not only a great strength of the Fiasco play model, but what in the end will distinguish our comic from most other comics. Each character really feels like an individual, and the story emerged from their interactions -- from the bottom up, as opposed to from the top down.<br/><br/>So in editing the dialogue, my focus was on maintaining the personalities of the characters. Secondary to that was hammering out the plot specifics, so that there was continuity and consistency. As a Fiasco player, I'm sure you're aware of how details can shift and change over the course of a session, and that doesn't really matter so much in a live session (in fact, it can be part of the fun). But once things start to get nailed down in a book aimed at a more general audience, that stuff has to line up and play out in a way that doesn't wreck the suspension of disbelief. And on that note, one thing we ended up doing was toning down the level of catastrophe a bit from the actual play session, in order to keep the proceedings believable and grounded.\n<blockquote><i>P.S.

From the outset, this project has been less about the object and more about the story, so even coming up with rewards was a challenge. I look at stretch goals for other book and comics projects and see things like increased production values, novelty items, etc., and can't really map that onto our project. Even just making it hardback doesn't make any sense, because it's only 72 pages long, and is sort of too "modest" in content to merit a hardback.<br/><br/>Any ideas would be welcome, though!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412392/#Comment_412392" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-22T00:14:42+00:00" title="April 22, 2013 12:14AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this just reached its funding goal!

Since no one else was going to read the script outside the team, there just needed to be enough information for everyone on the team to get things like character actions, etc. And throughout the process there were these thumbnail drawings of each page, which could usually answer any questions about framing and staging that arose (i.e., how wide or close a given "shot" needed to be). \n<blockquote>That's great to hear about the distinctive characters produced by the bottom-up approach; I'd been hoping for that, and that was one of the reasons I went in for a copy.  Does preserving that distinctiveness mean that you cut fewer lines than you would have otherwise?  I'm actually pretty surprised that 4 hours of talking could fit in anything <i>close</i> to 72 pages, so I've been assuming a <i>lot</i> was cut.</blockquote>\nIndeed, a lot was cut. It was a great exercise in editing for me and my managing editor, Donna Almendrala. I would say it was roughly equivalent to boiling a single paragraph down to 1 sentence. The goal was to distill while losing as little of the story's essential character as possible. I think that a 96-page comic book maps pretty well onto a 90-minute film, and the average Fiasco session (in our experience) feels equivalent in terms of ground covered by the story. But due to conservative strategizing on my part, we only had 72 pages to work with, so from those numbers I'm going to ballpark that we cut 20% of the raw story that was created during that first session. Not 20% of the dialogue -- we cut way more than 20% of that -- but 20% of plot development, side plots, etc. Learning what I have from <i>Bingo Baby</i>, I'm considering upping the page count to 96 for the next book (which we're starting June 1).\n<blockquote>Replacing a gonzo catastrophe with a more believable one makes sense to me.  Were there any other additions you deemed necessary?  Any added scenes?</blockquote>\nGosh, let me think -- I would have to go back and compare our raw transcript with the final book, it's all lost in the haze. I know we added a couple of "color" scenes, just visuals to give some context or to create a shift in the rhythm. We came up with one or two of those during the live session (as per the suggestion to do so in the Fiasco rules), and they were great, but their inclusion meant we needed to integrate similar scenes in other places for the sake of consistency and pacing. And if memory serves, we added some stuff near the end for the sake of clarity.\n<blockquote>I hope I'm not grilling you excessively here!  I have some practical and non-practical curiosity in answering whether the material of an RPG can merely <i>inspire</i> a publishable story, or whether that post-play sensation of, "Hey, if <i>that thing we just did</i> had been a comic, people would totally have loved reading it!" might ever be accurate.</blockquote>\nI firmly believe that that feeling can be accurate, but of course it depends on the specific story being told and the audience you want to reach with that story. Fiasco is structured in such a way that it is really good at producing stories worth sharing, and since a Coen Brothers movie is the basic model, the potential audience is broader than it might be for a story generated by a game more locked into a particular subculture. For our next project, we want to maintain an improvisational approach, but since one of our goals is to experiment from book to book, we need some other tool besides Fiasco. I've been playing the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game a lot lately, and I love <a href="http://lampblackandbrimstone.blogspot.com/2013/04/halls-of-minotaur-session-1-part-1.html" rel="nofollow">the stories that emerge from that</a>, but it I would be reluctant to lock our next story into the D&amp;D subculture. Not because it would hurt us in any way -- we'd probably sell more books, in fact -- but because that ground is already pretty well-covered.<br/><br/>And on that note, I'd love to hear any ideas anyone here might have for our next collaborative modus operandi!\n<blockquote>As a creator, how much of the work I'd ordinarily do has already been done?</blockquote>\nIn our experience, nearly all of it. Creating a story from nothing can sometimes be a painful, solitary, frustrating process, and what I love about role-playing games and improvisational acting is that, when the story-making is a joint venture, it comes alive and becomes entertaining and fun in its own right. It's one of those things where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and what you end up with is something that no single creator could have ever conceived. As a creator, my main contributions to <i>Bingo Baby</i> were choosing the approach (Fiasco) and editing. And I really enjoy editing. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412469/#Comment_412469" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T12:38:08+00:00" title="April 23, 2013 12:38PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a prospective player**, how much is reading this comic like being in the room for the playing of the game?</blockquote>\nGood question. I would say they are very different experiences. I think the comic is funny and entertaining, but it is also poignant and sad. All of those elements were present in the play session, but "funny and entertaining" drove the experience, which, like most sessions in our experience, got pretty raucous at times. The comic is not raucous, so the poignance and sadness rise in the mix.<br/><br/>Some potentially disturbing story elements were played for laughs and absurdity in the live session, which does not come through as easily on the page. For instance, the character Goldie is a 68-year-old retired train conductor with a drug problem. That was funny and profane in play, sort of tragic and potentially exploitative in translation. But just before we started playing, I reminded everyone to treat their characters like real people, to treat them with respect, regardless of how stupid or absurd they may end up behaving. Luckily, I think that worked (you'll be able to judge for yourself), because when the pleasure of the players is absent, the strength of the characters comes through. Another reason my editorial focus was on the characters.<br/><br/>In any case, reading the comic is a markedly different experience from playing the game, but I think anyone who reads it and then discovers that it was created using a game (information we reserve for the credits page at the end), will probably be really curious about the game.\n<blockquote>If I were ever able to give people a comic of my game that was fun to read <i>and</i> a genuine example of what play was like, that'd be <i>awesome</i>.

Good. Because that was created using Fiasco, but <i>playing</i> Fiasco is even better."\n<blockquote>*Is there some place online where folks discuss stuff like this?

That's cool about the page-to-minute ratio.  I assume that's a 3 x 3 panel grid, right?  A comic filled with big full-page (or full-spread) splash panels would be more pages, whereas something filled with 5 x 7 mini-panels (I'm thinking of some Matt Wagner Grendel here) would be fewer?<br/><br/>In imagining this process, I'm envisioning a lot of agonizing over how to retain the rich characterization while cutting a large percentage of the lines.<br/><br/>I've often thought that, as audiences, we only accept movie dialogue because we're conditioned to by all the other movies we've seen.  In real life, people are never so efficient and tidy.  They trail off, garble words, try three times to express a single point, etc.  I've generally found roleplay dialogue to be somewhere in between real life and movies, so I'm curious if you guys preserved that.\n<blockquote>I know we added a couple of "color" scenes, just visuals to give some context or to create a shift in the rhythm.

If seeing the utility of some good establishing shots (or other visuals) helps get your group to include more of those in their gaming, I'd consider that a win!  Not just for the fun factor, but also for subsequent projects.  Here's hoping!\n<blockquote>For our next project, we want to maintain an improvisational approach, but since one of our goals is to experiment from book to book, we need some other tool besides Fiasco.</blockquote>I really want to offer my supervillain game, but that seems maybe a little too self-promotional.  If your group is into that sort of thing, just let me know, otherwise I'll suggest <i>Coming of Age</i>, a sweet game about making mistakes and learning from them.  It's a single session game, and though the dice mechanics are involved in everything that happens, you're totally free to improv the fiction.  It also comes with a bunch of scenario ideas in case you'd prefer to pick one rather than starting from scratch.<br/><br/>Other options:<br/><br/>With no GM:<br/><i>1001 Nights</i>: very freeform telling of tales about anything you want, but the tellers are members of the Sultan's court, vying for status and survival.<br/><i>Contenders</i>: play boxers, trying to deal with their real life problems and keep hope alive while fighting for money and opportunities.<br/><i>Kagematsu</i>: the situation and character goals are already scripted -- can any of the village women win the samurai's affection so he'll save the village? -- but the players can pursue this goal absolutely however they want.<br/><br/>With some sort of GM (though not the traditional kind):<br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i>: system focuses on characters' issues, with support for spotlight time and setting stakes for conflicts. <br/><i>Swords Without Master</i>: sword &amp; sorcery fantasy "short story" game where the characters aren't exactly heroes, and play alternates between phases where different fictional elements are at stake.<br/><i>Monsterhearts</i>: has a specific but popular genre (teen monsters) and lots of freedom, like Fiasco, but also has rules for outcomes of certain actions, and won't reach any sort of conclusion in one or two sessions.\n<blockquote><blockquote>As a creator, how much of the work I'd ordinarily do has already been done?</blockquote>\nIn our experience, nearly all of it.

I've been wary of the editing required to turn a bunch of improvised content into something readable, but your example is making it look, if not easy, then at least feasible.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413018/#Comment_413018" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T00:09:16+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 12:09AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2013 12:12AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"funny and entertaining" drove the experience, which, like most sessions in our experience, got pretty raucous at times.

I think it's something about the process of seeing holes, and filling those holes with unexpected content.  It's the difference between:<br/><br/><i>there's a person with a drug problem who is a retired 68-year-old and they used to be a train conductor and their name is Goldie</i><br/><br/>and<br/><br/><i>we need a person with a drug problem... edgy teen? stressed banker? no, wait, let's have an old woman!<br/>does she have a sordid past? illness?  no, she's retired from her glamorous life!<br/>her glamorous life as a...  secret agent? racecar driver?  train conductor!<br/>yes!  old Goldie misses her days on the rails!</i><br/><br/>Does that sound right?  If so, I imagine there might be ways to emulate that experience visually, with unexpected sequences:<br/><br/>Shady thug... cash... pills... alley... metal pole... the metal pole is revealed to be the pole of a walker as we see granny getting onto the retirement home shuttle!<br/><br/>Back at home, we see parts of photos, hung in huge wooden frames, perhaps with golden title plaques, showing Goldie in her youth, in saucy poses, radiating glamour... and then zoom out from one to show that she's flashing her grin and thumbs-up while pulling on the train whistle!<br/><br/>Well, maybe not, but still an interesting thought, at least to me.  Perhaps other concerns are more crucial, but I think presenting the story elements <i>as perceived by the group at the time</i> might be cool.

I recall either Peter David, Dennis O'Neil, or another longtime Marvel/DC guy being a huge proponent of using the exact movie script format, while Grant Morrison wrote pages and pages of descriptive text and Neil Gaiman gave captions and dialogue with sketchy thumbnails.  It struck me that, as an illustrator, I would much rather work with some of these guys than others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
