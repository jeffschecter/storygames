It's actually a follow-on to our old <i>CyborGladiators </i>game, turning to the more popular &amp; more kid-friendly robots. So, while it's basically a straight fighting game, I'm looking to amp up the story side by having you earn Glory points and then gaining various cool 'gimmicks' for your robot at various point breaks. I'm taking a lot of these from wrestling, like a showy entrance or signature move, and I'm looking for more suggestions on gimmicks to add showmanship &amp; personality to your robot fighter (upgrades are handled separately through purses of credits).

How do you feel these things will strengthen the story side?</blockquote>\nRight now, it's pretty much a pure fighting game. So one of the problems, I think, is it's fun to pull out for a one-shot battle or a fight night every so often, but there's not a lot of 'pull' to play an ongoing game, even a short-term one. Setting up a system for personalizing your robot by 'leveling up' gives you more incentive to follow your robot's career, and, with your friends, to develop your own storylines around the fights - rivalries, alliances, etc. It opens up another dimension to the game beyond just what happens in the matches themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153164/#Comment_153164" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T11:52:23+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 11:52AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hype and drama of wrestling is not driven by advancement--wrestlers rarely "level up," per se--so what you want, basically, is PTA meets Mechwarrior.<br/><br/>Think soap operas--that's the wrestling model. Villains become heroes become villains. Back-dealing managers and agents. Blatant cheating while the ref is distracted (makes villains). Defeating the ravenous, over-powered new beast of a guy (makes heroes). Girlfriends disparaged and defended (or cheating-ass byatches). Honor, Pageantry, Melodrama; not "more juice." It's RARE that a wrestler actually quantitatively changes; and qualitative changes revolve around popularity, winning and defending titles, behaviors, team-ups, and between-match shenanigans.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David<br/>Never watches wrestling.

The Glory track is a way to measure your robot's rise in fame, not in power. So you gain Glory for winning matches &amp; other cool stuff you do in the arena. When you gain x number of points, you get to choose a 'gimmick,' like entrance music, to personalize your robot and reflect his greater fame. Just like in wrestling - you don't start out with a big entrance or a lot of storylines around you - you have to work your way up &amp; earn it. And then using your gimmicks in matches gets you more Glory, so it's also a self-feeding engine, the more famous your robot gets, the more possibilities open to get even more famous. Now I'm thinking there may be a way to spend your Glory to 'buy' storylines or something, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153172/#Comment_153172" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T12:27:37+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 12:27PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gundam had a great gimmick: Bits<br/>\nIndependent satellites that could be used in different ways:<br/>\nShield<br/>\nRemote laser cannon<br/>\nGroup or remote laser guns<br/>\nReflector for trick shots<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great gimmick is Psychic interfaces<br/>\nCan add to maneuverability<br/>\nOr an increase in the ability to process incoming data, including sensor data<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could take a cue from modern defense, active armor that ejects an armor plate at incoming attack s to get it to detonate/waste energy without hitting the mech.<br/>\n<br/>\nVotoms had a great gimmick: Roller feet<br/>\nHad tracks on the bottom of the feet to increase speed on flat ground...<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course transformation/combination are great gimmicks too, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nHidden gimmicks!
