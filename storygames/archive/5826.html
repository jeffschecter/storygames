When I was getting the text laid out, and the artists were handing in the last of their work, I started thinking about what kind of cover art this game was going to have. I wanted something with guns, demons, violence. The first Dread cover art, back in the day, was a brooding blue landscape. Evocative, but I wanted to go a different route this time. So, while browsing the online gallery of one of the artists that had worked on the interior illustrations, I saw this image which depicted a guy shooting at some off-screen assailant, with a large city in ruins behind him. I elected to use it as my cover illustration.<br/><br/>But graphic design isn't my forte, and it didn't look so hot when I was finished. Meanwhile, the people who executed the layout of Dread said that they wanted to tackle the cover illustration, and they came up with a few images. One image, which consisted of red blood splattered against a white background, reminded me of Dexter (a great show) and Unsane (a great band). I gave it the thumbs up, and that was the cover of Dread. Almost immediately after the book was released, someone pointed out that this looked a lot like the cover to another game. I compared the two and thought, damn. It's true. This isn't acceptable.<br/><br/>So, after a couple of days of making sure that it would work, we switched to the other cover that they had created, which depicted a screaming face. A few weeks after that, I learned that though I could use the image for the book cover, I was not permitted to use it for anything else (posters, for example, or other kinds of promotional materials). The screaming face was a stock image of some kind. It's my own stupid fault for not asking.<br/><br/>I decided to bite the bullet and commission a cover. Tariq Raheem, who worked on Farscape (TV series) and Heavenly Sword (video game), created the new (and final) cover art for Dread, which will be released this March. And that's that. This is the final ultimate last finished cover art, and I want a copy dropped in the casket with me when the time comes.<br/><br/>Here's a preview: <a href="http://www.dread-rpg.com/dreadcoverpreview.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dread-rpg.com/dreadcoverpreview.jpg</a><br/><br/><b>COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS</b><br/><br/>If you live in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, you *need* to attend CollectiveCon! I'm still finalizing the details, but here's what I can tell you: It's a gaming convention that's focused on independent role-playing games. It will be held this July at All Fun &amp; Games in Apex, NC. A few people have already said they'll be there, and they'll be running all kinds of kickass independent games (and some traditional stuff as well, so it's got something for everyone). I'm definitely going to run a session of Dread, so if that's what you're into, be sure to attend! Here's the web site (which is full of information that's subject to change a bit over the next few months):<br/><br/><a href="http://collectivecon.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://collectivecon.wordpress.com</a><br/><b><br/>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</b><br/><br/>There's a lot of discussion going on at the Dread forums. Subjects being discussed include customized elements (player-created spells and vehicles, director-created demons and NPCs), non-demonic enemies (like vampires, for example), and scenario length. If you've got questions that need answering (or answers for my questions), then check out the forums.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dread-rpg.com/forum/index.php?board=11.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dread-rpg.com/forum/index.php?board=11.0</a><br/><b><br/>DREAD THREADS</b><br/><br/>A few Dread-related threads continue to rampage onward. This one, over at Story Games, started off as an announcement that the RPGPundit had reviewed my game at theRPGsite. It has since evolved into a very entertaining read (as far as I'm concerned). We chatted about Steven Seagal, the A-Team, and Blade 2.

If you do post your Actual Play report somewhere else, so much the better -- you expose other people to the mind-virus that is Dread!

I've been kind of remiss about those, lately, but one of the things I'm going to start doing again is recording my sessions and posting them as podcasts. This has already been discussed elsewhere, but in brief, I take a three- or four-hour gaming session and edit it down to a 20-minute radio show, with music and narration. The first installment of the DreadCast is <a href="http://www.dread-rpg.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> (bottom of the page). I think it's kind of a different approach to game podcasting, but I believe that it follows the philosophy described above: it's funny, it's anecdotal, it consists of short bursts of information that are separated from one another, and it's fairly casual. When I type up my AP reports and post them, which I have also neglected lately, I try to do the same thing with the text.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>Oh and the commisioned art looks great!</blockquote>\nThanks! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Of course, when I can show you more than a small portion of a sketch, I think (hope!) you'll be even more impressed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>In this world of messageboards and blogs and facebook etc. I think we can sometimes forget what a powerful tool an simple opt-in mailing list can be.

I'm kinda against casual tone. But obviously it can be done well. What I'm really against, however, is individuals posing as a "game publisher." When I see "Clever Name Publishers today released their new RPG, Clever: the Clevering..." and I know that "they" are just one guy, I cringe.</blockquote>\nYeah... I see what you mean. Back when I started working on Dread, I saw that everyone else was doing it, so I came up with a name for my 'company', and I never did get out of the habit. I know that Clinton Nixon changed Anvilwerks to CRN Games, which is pretty cool. I keep thinking that maybe I should do something similar, since it's obvious that this game is the work of one dude.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Raf doesn't say "Our art department considered what sort of cover to have" he says that *he* considered it. That's just more honest and clear. Anyone who is trying to pose as an entire organization for the sake of legitimacy is missing the "indie" vibe.</blockquote>\nThat's kind of my compromise. I still use Neoplastic Press (mainly because I think it's funny when people say, "That sounds vaguely sci-fi or something. Why Neoplastic?" and then I tell them that it refers to the abnormal proliferation of tissue cells, such as in a tumor), but I try to make it clear that this is all my work, my ideas, my text, my games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131130/#Comment_131130" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T05:55:44+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  5:55AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Rafael uses tools (I suspect Google Notify) to keep abreast of developments...</blockquote>\nHey, hombre.

The thing is, it's not an exact science. There's a thread about Dread on RPG.net, but since they're not using the game's full name, Google Alert doesn't pick up on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
