Each player would be given one chance to tackle one of the Threats on the board, trying to solve it, uncover some info about it, reveal the true Threat hiding behind the scenes, building the portal to wherever, etc. If the attempt was successful, then that was an opportunity for them to fill in details about what was going on, while not succeeding meant that there was some kind of complication...usually an Action scene where the players then had to fight it out in order to get the answers they wanted! Anything not touched upon by the players during the Suspense scene would go unanswered until next time...or were just not important enough to the story for anyone to care.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420552/#Comment_420552" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T07:50:52+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  7:50AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some older and lengthier threads that include a lot on this topic. <br/><br/>Most of the time I've handled it as stupidgremlin has done.<br/><br/>I will try to find time to post more about Danger Patrol suspense.
