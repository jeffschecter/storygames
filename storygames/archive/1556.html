                    After doing chargen and setting up some goblins and zombies as antagonists, I'm re-thinking my adventure setup. So far I have the following relationships:
<ul>
<li>Father - In league with goblin necromantic cult, placing personal power over family.</li>
<li>Mother - In league, hoping to get her son back.</li>
<li>Son (dead)</li>
<li>Daughter - Recently fled her family, trying to keep her son from being resurrected.</li>
<li>Goblin Leader - Community leader of cult, allied with human Father to push influence into the human community.</li>
<li>Goblin Brother - In love with daughter, not sure whether to abandon goblin community for the daughter's sake.</li>
</ul>
So there you have it. This is a pretty Dungeon-Crawly game, but I'd like to inject some story into things, even if it's solved through "Who do we kill, and who do we side with?"<br/><br/>The problem I'm having is how to present this to the players. The players are members of the Empire's elite Chimera Guard (government-sanctioned adventurers). They will be introduced to the daughter, who is in an infirmary recovering, and told to stop the Goblin Cult, especially their alliance with the Father. Is this a strong enough stepping-off point?<br/><br/>I'm also worried about good, gripping bangs. The party consists of: 2 human fighters, 1 gnome fighter (riding a war dog), 1 human cleric (Good and Healing domains). The goblin cult uses the Water and Death spell domains.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>

                            You haven't mentioned the PCs having any personal stake in this.  So it seems just like a basic hook -- i.e. this is backstory to the adventure rather than story.  <br/><br/>What I would want to know is what you're planning for the adventure.  What are the PCs like as people?  What are the locations and encounters you're planning?  What's the dungeon and monsters like?  Those are going to be the center of the story in play.  <br/><br/>It's not necessarily directly applicable, but I've got an essay on <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/buffy/adventuredesign.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Buffy Adventure Design</b></a> which talks about making interesting story adventures that center on monster-fighting.                        </div>

                            As framed, I can understand how you would be afraid that players will take the info fromt he daughter and just kill from one end of the cult to the other: problem solved. Definately a motivation for adventure, but not one that's going to get them tied up in the complexities and characterizations.  As such:<br/><br/>* Who has fallen under the sway of the cult an needs to be rescued, not killed?  And who else wants to make sure he/she is accidentally killed?<br/>* Where is the cult operating so that a group of adventurers can't just wipe them out dungeon-crawl style?<br/>* For that matter, why are they sending adventurers rather than soldiers?  Is there missing intelligence? Is there a need for plausible deniability? Is this really abotu sendign a message to someone else, perhaps the patron of the cult? Or is this just an expression of a personal vendetta against the father?<br/>* Whose body does the cult have, stolen from a gravesite, animated as a shambling corpse and making an abomination of a beloved family member, put to rest? Which PCs family is having old grief's ripped open purely so this cult can have more muscle?<br/>* And while were at it, what about the rest of the bodies?<br/>* Who remembers the father when he was a good man?  And what does he want power _for_? Power is never an end, it's a means, so what does he want to use it for, and is this somethign you'd want to stop?<br/><br/>Some of these suggest direct player hooks, some of them hopefully just suggest things which might in turn suggest hooks, but they're the lens I would take to this setup.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

<b>John</b>: The reason I don't have much PC information is because the <i>characters</i> are more combat tokens (presently) than characters. If you check out the actual play post (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21751</a>) you'll see that the players aren't too involved emotionally.<br/><br/>I want to involve the players on a light emotional level, because the PCs are just what I said above, three fighters and a cleric. Alignment was even an afterthought (I think they're all neutral good). Looking through the sheets I see one sticky note for a fighter that says, "self imposed wanderer, in search of money &amp; fortune. Tough but kind adventurer with a dark secret"<br/><br/>I should note that we're going to jump from scene to scene, and not do a mapped dungeon crawl. The planned locations (all combat-oriented) take place in the Undercity (a city carved out of the stone beneath the earth; the players' city is built on top of it):
<ul>
<li><b>Abandoned warehouse/glassworks</b> (above ground, with an entrance to the Undercity): The above-ground base of operations for the Father.</li>
<li>&gt;<b>Webbed Alcove</b>: A way to throw spiders at the party. The goblins have made peace with the spiders in exchange for food.</li>
<li><b>Plaza</b>: An open-area for combat.</li>
<li><b>Ballroom</b>: The center of operations for the goblin cult/band</li>
<li><b>Sunken Area</b>: Not sure what <i>kind</i> of area, but a stage for the attempted resurrection of the dead son via the watery death god.<br/></li></ul>
Encounters (mixed up throughout the above locations, as needed):
<ul>
<li>Combinations of Goblins, Goblin Brutes (warrior levels), Goblin Acolytes (Water/Death cleric levels), Zombies</li>
<li>NPCs: Father, Mother, Goblin Brother, Goblin Leader</li>
<li>Semi-intelligent monstrous spiders</li>
</ul>
My hope is that the players will use their combat choices (who to fight, who to subdue, who to kill, who NOT to fight) as their means of influencing the story.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><b>Rob</b>: Thanks for the questions! I'll ponder this and respond later.                        </div>

                            Here's the QA I came up with. Through the course of answering, I revised my NPC list and removed everyone but the Mother, Father, Goblin Leader and Dead Son.<br/><br/>Q. Why did the goblins align with the watery death god?<br/>A. The goblin leader died and was resurrected by the god.<br/><br/>Q. Why would a human ally with the goblins?<br/>A. To get a son back.<br/><br/>Q. How did the human contact the goblins at first?<br/>A. Human was investigating the goblin cult<br/><br/>Q. Why was the human investigating?<br/>A. He was a member of the Chimera Guard.<br/><br/>Q. How did his son die?<br/>A. In the War. He doesn't want his son to become a zombie.<br/><br/>Q. Why won't he become a zombie?<br/>A. The human has seen the god resurrect goblins to full potential.<br/><br/>Q. How did he witness this?<br/>A. He saw dead goblins brought back.<br/><br/>Q. Are they really brought back?<br/>A. They aren't zombies. Though the human ignores their blind devotion to the god.<br/><br/>Q. Why do the goblins trust the human?<br/>A. He killed his companion(s) in front of the goblins.<br/><br/>Q. What can he offer the goblins?<br/>A. An agent to act in the city.<br/><br/>Q. Where are the goblins getting their human bodies?<br/>A. Recent remains of the soldiers from a War.<br/><br/>Q. How do the living feel about it?<br/>A. The Empire is keeping it under wraps.<br/><br/>Q. Why is the goblin cult creating zombies?<br/>A. To combat the other Undercity goblin clans. To silence the Overcity dwellers when needed.<br/><br/>Q. How are other goblin cults responding?<br/>A. They are afraid and in hiding. They haven't yet considered allying.<br/><br/>Q. What about the mother of the dead son?<br/>A. She discovered the plot and fled to the Empire. They have her in confinement to keep the situation secret.<br/><br/>Q. Why can't the city soldiery know about this?<br/>A. To prevent panic. This is a matter for the Chimera Guard.<br/><br/>Q. Why pick the 1st-level heroes?<br/>A. Heroes are few and far between in the city, with most involved in the War.                        </div>

                            Ok, here's the rub - your questions paint a very complete picture of a situation, and they definitely deepen it, but I'm not seeing anything in the situation which is going to create a sense of buy in from the players, beyond the implicit contract of "it's a dungeon, so we'll go in".  In short, how many of those answers are going to matter to the players?<br/><br/>So that said, lemme throw some slightly more meta questions at you.<br/><br/>1) Do you anticipate the players making any real <b>choice</b> (in the non-tactical sense) in the course of this?  If so, what will it be?  How will the outcome meaningfully change as a result?<br/>2) In 5 levels, when they've done a complete gear rotation, why is it going to matter that they did this?<br/>3) What would happen if the players didn't do this?  Are you willing to let that happen?<br/><br/>I think you've really set up an excellent situation, but I'm mostly not sure how your players are going to have any visibility into that.  That may sound like an abstract concern, but it's really very concrete, since it means the players won't appreciate the work you put in, which will probably be frustrating for you, and as you take actions in support of your sense of the story, it may appear capricious and arbitrary to your players, which may frustrate them. <br/><br/>Now, whether the route to visibility is IC or OOC is a point of genuine debate, and one that is really going to depend upon your taste, but the bottom line is that I'm really worried that the thought you've put into this will go to waste.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            ...and do the players know wha's going on?  Sure, they could walk away and say "bah, who cares about goblins?!"  but if you clue them in then the players can begin thinking about the dynamics their characters want to display.  You usually can't assume a player is going to think about something like "how do I view death or the afterlife?" and in the pitch of battle is never a good time for those details to come out (it's just rushed and usually very self-serving-in-the-moment sort of decision).   My suggestion? Tell them about the plot.  Tell them some of the things you told us and what you hope the characters will find out and what's at stake?  What does failure mean?  If the players know that it will motivate them to care about what happens.                        </div>

<b>Rob:</b> <br/><br/>1) Anticipating choice. I would love to give the players some choice. I know that one player has expressed to me desire for meaningful choices. Another just wants to fight monsters. And this is why I want the choices to be made mostly via combat decisions. These decisions being <i>Who do we fight?</i>, <i>Who do we side with in this combat?</i>, and so on.<br/>2 &amp; 3) Good questions. That's why I've got to set some stakes that matter.<br/><br/>I agree about player visibility, and I'll be the last person to want "Behind-the-scenes DM-only" knowledge. Too easily, that leads to a DM with all this backstory and players completely in the dark.<br/><br/>To the end of player choice, I'm thinking I should add another faction to the mix. So rather than just "Stop the goblin cult," it becomes a "How do you stop the goblin cult? Any decision you make has ramifications."<br/><br/><b>Russel &amp; Don:</b><br/>The players don't yet know what's going on, but I'm going to key them in. Here's the email:
<blockquote><br/>Okay! Here's the thing! I don't want to do the typical "DM has a secret story given out in little spoonfuls." I'd like to try something a little different, more along the lines of "DM provides an jumping off point, Players run wild."<br/><br/>To that end, when the adventure starts tonight, I'll just lay my cards on the table, with the various things I've loosely planned on happening. NPCs, monster encounters, and so on.<br/><br/>If this turns out to be not-so-fun, I'm happy going back to a more traditional D&amp;D style.<br/><br/></blockquote> </div>

                            In your AP post you asked about Spot/Hide and Listen/Move Silently. You do two opposed checks, just like you thought. It's something that's been simplified in other versions of d20 (eg Sneak/Notice).<br/>
<br/>
Looking over d20srd.org, I couldn't figure out what Listen gets you. Spot lets you see an otherwise hidden enemy, who normally has all kinds of miss chances and other advantages. But what does hearing an enemy get you? In other words, if you don't hear an enemy, what advantage do they have? You'd think it would help them Hide, at least.                        </div>

                            Third session! Though it's far from a "story game," so far as I understand the term. Unless y'all want, if things remain at the "miniature combat" level, I'll stop cross-posting.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21877.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21877.0</a> </div>

                            I enjoy following along, FWIW.<br/>

p.s. I think Rob D is right. Listen is purely an old skool, "do you get surprised or not" ability.                        </div>

                            I couldn't help adding: if you're looking to challenge 3 fighters, hit them with Will saves. Traps that increase the difficulty of an encounter might also be fun--something like a pressure plate that fills the room with water, pits that restrict their mobility or cut off their escape, rather than the "oops take damage" type of traps. You also mentioned wanting to keep them from "recharging". A trap that cuts off their exit tunnel, and forces them to find another way out, might be a good call.                        </div>
