I do not know the names of everyone in the game since nobody ever introduced themselves, but there were four women and three men including the GM. We started by rolling characters. I do not remember a lot about everyone's characters except there was one mermaid (get it??) and I was playing a maid with high Athletics and rainbow eyes.<br/><br/>I will admit with chagrin that the premise of the game creeped me out a little bit. Basically the master had rejected every woman he had come close to marrying prior to the wedding, and his parents told the maids that one of them would be marrying him. It was set up as a competition where whoever had the most favor at the end of the game would marry that master. When he started putting the idea out there I thought that the maids were going to try to find a woman who liked the master and vice-versa, but instead it was a reality television show. I might actually yoink that idea and run a convention game of Maid with the "find the master a girlfriend" premise.<br/><br/>I think I was the only one at the table not engaged with that idea though. Everyone jumped to make the Master happy. Even when I tried to engage with this I struggled with it, as the Master wasn't actually making any requests of his maids. He just hung back and muddled around, and when we did tasks for him whether we gained or lost favor seemed totally random and up to whatever internal metric the GM was using.<br/><br/>So I think in this particular setting a stronger Master who was clear on what he wanted, and something less competitive would be what I would try to do if I were running a con game. However! This is making me sound like I didn't like the game. I did.<br/><br/>The player of the mermaid stole the show for me. She got into all sorts of non-sequiter adventures to make cakes and pick berries. The player was very much pursuing the convention game as a project-based sandbox to pursue her own agenda, which was often hilarious. And then we realized we could spend Favor on Random Events.<br/><br/>Up to this point the GM had been very laid back about providing events for us to interact with. We basically were providing the structure of the game, running around and laying out the master's agenda and trying to set up events where he would interact with us. Then the Random Events.<br/><br/>The GM allowed the player who paid for the random event to play out. This led to the player of the mermaid rolling a herd of animals invading the mansion, and she then went on at length about how soft and fluffy and magical the sheep were. I am sure this is a "you-had-to-be-there" thing but this was my favorite thing about the game. I just could not find that level of excitement about the softness of sheep with any of the guys I regularly game with. Sorry fellas. I wish you liked sheep more. The game then digressed for awhile into everyone drawing pictures of sheep on their character sheets. I drew a sheep who had fallen asleep on the back of a bigger sheep and was dreaming about sheep.<br/><br/>The other random Events involved the world burning in nuclear fire and the setting becoming post-apocalyptic, a giant mech landing and petting the sheep, aliens flying through and dropping a mall down next to the mansion (fully staffed and with interdimensional portals to other malls), and then the world was overtaken by mutant plants and turned into a jungle world.<br/><br/>Holy cow I had a blast. I struggled a little bit but in the ways that you do sometimes when you play with people outside your game group (I got shut down at one point for 'metagaming' when I was trying to author stance my way into an interesting scene), but the game was tops and zany and delivered what it promised. I'm going to try to run it at the next convention I go to I think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260114/#Comment_260114" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T19:11:33+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  7:11PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The second part (sheep --&gt; apocalypse --&gt; mechas --&gt; aliens --&gt; malls --&gt; mutant plantes) sure sounds like when we play round robin with my nongamer friends... but anyway, this looks like lots of fun. How was the story structured? what did actually happen, what did you have to do? was it confined to creating small scenarios and playing them out (the mall, preparing the cake, the sheep, picking the berries, etc), or was some sort of bigger agenda/history going on in the meantime, and all of those small tableaus went on beside that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260385/#Comment_260385" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T22:31:24+00:00" title="March  5, 2010 10:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thread title caught my attention, and the play report didn't disappoint <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260588/#Comment_260588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T13:29:21+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  1:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant to post earlier, but have been exceedingly distracted lately. ^_^;<br/><br/>It sounds like the GM was running the "Maids Take the Stage" scenario, and like a lot of Maid RPG scenarios it's highly structured (almost like slapping a short, constrained indie RPG on top of Maid), and needs a lot of buy-in from the players into whatever the scenario is meant to be about and how the scenario writer decided to set it up. Most of the written scenarios actually tell you not to use random events when playing them, as they tend to throw the scenario into utter chaos. Although there are some scenarios in the book I found a lot of fun (like Black Cat Mansion, which is basically an excuse to use the random item table a lot, coupled with the challenge of trying to redeem two reluctant NPCs), I much prefer random event-driven play. It's totally exhausting to run (like, I need to stop doing it at cons just for my own sanity), but IMO it's very much where Maid RPG's greatest strength lies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260891/#Comment_260891" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T07:07:23+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  7:07AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Albi, the story started off with the GM kind if sitting back and waiting for us to do things to make the Master happy. This was kind of fun but also a little torturous as the GM was making his own decisions about what the wanted Master with some prompting from success rolls. I got a little frustrated because I got three amazing rolls in a row without getting any favor, and then I fail a roll and the GM took favor away.  Have you ever dealt with an unhappy child who wants something but can't or won't tell you what they want? I found this part of the game to be about as fun as that. We were trying to make the Master like us, but the master was quiet, brooding, and moody. Ahhh!<br/><br/>It ended up being a lot of mini-scenes going on, somewhat non-sequitur from everything else. I think the GM had a plan, but as Neko said the structure got completely destroyed by the random events.<br/><br/>Random event driven play is really, really fun. It makes me want to run a convention game of this baaad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
