                    I was talking about pricing issues in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1256&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> in Self-Promotion. This is a quick follow-up to that.<br/><br/>Having put some more data into my spreadsheet, I've found two pretty reliable ways to estimate a price for your soon-to-be-released RPG, based on current practice by other indie (mostly Forge) designers. In both cases, you need to know or estimate the length of your book in letter size (8.5x11in).<br/><br/><em>Method I.</em> Take page count, raise to the 0.25 power, and multiply by 6.4. -- 6.4*x^0.25<br/><em>Method II.</em> (quicker and dirtier) Multiply page count by 0.08 and add $12.<br/><br/>Using these formulas, the discrepancy from existing games' actual prices is ~16% and ~18% respectively. Given that the formulas do not account for artwork and other such costs, this seems pretty good. I'd suggest, then, that if you have little or no art, you take a bit off the calculated price, and if you have a ton, you add some on. But a lot comes down to taste and marketing strategy as well.<br/><br/>All the above is for printed books, of course. If you're selling in PDF as well, then it seems you might consider selling it for 50-60% of the print cost. (Depending, probably on what features you include, and just how expensive your print runs are.)<br/><br/><br/>As I remarked in the last thread, this says nothing about how much the indie community should be charging, merely what it is. But maybe this will provide a decent estimate for some people.                </div>

                            Uh... good god, no.<br/><br/>Jasper, I respect what you're trying for, but what you've developed are formulas to typify indie RPG prices.  That's not at all the same thing as a formula to set prices.<br/><br/>The price you set for a book needs to be based on exactly two things: (a) how much it cost to make the book and (b) how much you want to make off of each book.  The final price is a+b.  Now, that is an oversimplification, but you cannot cannot <em>cannot</em> base your prices for your products and your production process and your production costs off of others' prices/products/costs.  If I happen to know some printers personally, and they cut me a break on printing costs, I'm going to get my printing done cheaper than you.  You do <em>not</em> have to chase my pricepoint, and probably shouldn't, unless you're in some sort of direct competition with me and are singling me out as the competitor to beat.                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>I get you. I would never advise forgetting about actual printing costs or the particulars of each game. Yet it seems like a lot of people (including myself) have been casting about for that "b" part of your "a+b."  Also, while I agree we can't be chasing eachother's price points, our games don't exist in a vacuum, and there's been plenty of discussion lately about perceptions of what's normal; if I charge twice as much as everyone else is charging, that might matter to my customers.<br/><br/>The formulas may indeed be useful only as a check, and not a starting place, though.                        </div>

<p>Here's what you do, Jasper:</p>
<p>Figure out what other people charge.</p>
<p>Can you charge more? Do it!</p>
<p>Can you charge less? Do it!</p>
<p>This is not an ethical problem. It's a practical one. How much <em>can</em> you charge for your game? Will raising the price by a dollar cost you more sales than it would gain you dollars? That is, if you charge $20, will you sell 20 more games if you charge $19?</p>
<p>Under the Bed is $16. At that rate, I could make $x if I sold y copies. That was my main concern.</p>
<p>Shock: is $23. It was a lot more work to make and has many more words. It's more like Dogs in the Vineyard in scale, so it could be a similar price. Maybe a little more. And since The Mountain Witch ($26) had come out the previous year and people seemed to really like my book design, I decided that I could charge more than Vincent does. I bet he can charge $24 and not lose any customers.</p>
<p>Honestly, this discussion really belongs over at the Forge in Publishing.</p>

                            I respect everyone's opinions on this. However, there's a different way of looking at pricing policy: How much investment do you want from your players?<br/>
<br/>
I believe people are much more inclined to appreciate products they buy, compared to freebies. The more you pay, the more you've invested, and the more you're likely to work to get returns on that investment, in the form of entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
If your game is for a very small crowd, who will probably enjoy it immensely - or get some other payoff (like status) from owning it, price high! If it's for a broad market, many of which probably won't even play it (for instance, a jokey game), price low!                        </div>

Sometimes, if you pay $30 for a book, you'd give it 3/5 stars, whereas if you paid $20 for it, you'd give it 4.5/5 stars, even though you're assumingly rating the book in a void, you don't.                        </div>

                            This is my formula---[[Per-unit cost of books] + [Production costs (art &amp; layout) / 500 (the number of books I expect to sell in 1-1.5 years)] + [$10 (my profit)]] / [.85 (to account for IPR's fulfillment charge)].  <br><br>You can estimate the per-unit cost as ($0.025 x page count +$1) for a b+w softcover.<br><br>Production costs are going to vary on how much you want to spend, but you can estimate $1-2 a book.<br/><br/>A more traditional esitmate is---[[[(per-unit cost) + (production costs)] x 2] / (.4)]<br/><br/>Considering that the retailer is going to ger 40%, and the distributor is going to get 20%, this means you the publisher are going to keep 40% of the cover. Of that 40%, you want at least half to be profit. This way, the profit from one book can be used to fund a second. Understand?                        </br></br></br></br></div>
