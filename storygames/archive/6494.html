The big change this time is that the judges are only rating the top 5 reviews - all other prizes are being distributed through random drawing among the remaining entries.  This way the reviews we consider to be the very best get first pick at the prize pool, but everyone has an opportunity to walk away with PDFs from White Wolf, RedBrick, and Evil Hat Productions.<br/><br/>Sound interesting?  <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=393667" rel="nofollow">More here.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148486/#Comment_148486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T17:24:22+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  5:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2008 5:24PM by C.W.Richeson.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EOS Press has donated prizes for the best message board post / actual play post, so even folk who don't have time to write reviews can walk away with a nifty prize just by talking about their favorite fantasy RPGs!<br/><br/>Over a week left to write up a review!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
