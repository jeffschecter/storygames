Well, wait a minute.  I've never seriously been involved in an online forum game, though I have been involved in MUDs.  It seems to me that they do have people who pay attention to their rules.  For example, <a href="http://www.romanlegion.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>The Roman Legion</b></a> seems like a pretty thoroughly worked out set of rules.  <br/><br/>Also, I'd point out that <b>Code of Unaris</b> was specifically developed with chat in mind.  <br/><br/>I think, though, that the main problem is lack of channels for distribution.  i.e. Even if one online fora has put together a really good set of posting rules, newcomers who set up their fora are unlikely to "buy" their rules.  It's not a consumerist culture, or at least not a rules-consumerist culture.  <br/><br/>I see the same thing of Scandanavian larps.  They rarely run a game the way someone else has written, and rarely print their own game materials.  Play is passed by transmission rather than publishing.                        </div>

                            Levi, yes, I really agree. I'd like to see some sort of fusion between the whole play-by-bulletin-board thing and the style of games we talk about here.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in games like <a href="http://www.ogame.org/" rel="nofollow">Ogame</a>, which have a huge following. Some sort of hippy nar variant on that would be fascinating.<br/><br/>I'd like to know what happened with your game which you started but couldn't past a certain point.<br/><br/>(Per: Yes, I'm cobbling together an online version of BtI.

                            The forum based game that I played in for 6 months about three years ago (things may have changed and this is but one example, not a huge over-arching view), had less of a set of hard-set rules and more conventions of play,<br/>
<br/>
The conventions of play suggested things like how often to contribute to the story, what the premise of the story was, and how to indicate conversation, thoughts, and actions.  The game supported tension and drama for the first three months and then things fell away slowly and after three more months no one posted to the game.<br/>
<br/>
From this brief experience, I would agree with jhkim that this group is not a good target for rules consumption in a marketing sense.  If you were a Web Developer and could design a forum that supported this form of play, perhaps giving a specific wall paper option to posts that indicated things about setting, etcetera and encouragd people to have their avatars be their character picture.  It would attract people if it were free, but if you expected them to pay, I think they would take their games to a free site.<br/>
<br/>
On a seperate note, if you were wanting to write a game in an offline format that would appeal to this market, that's a different problem and has some serious challenges.  The first and most difficult issue that I see is player inertia.  Why should they change their play experience radically if they are enjoying and comfortable with the format they are currently engaged in?  I'm clueless there.                        </div>

                            Yeh....some day (maybe today?!) I have a big thing to write up about my Hunter: the Reckoning forum play, which I did hardcore for about two years, and then continued participating in for another two. <br><br>My experience was that it was very very much a social/community thing, including the attendant personal drama. There was a rigid definition of "how we play," and variations from that method were met with harsh moderation. Keep in mind that almost everyone playing in this community was coming out of tabletop play, mostly White Wolf, NOT freeform! But yes, Jonathan's post:

                            I have a heeeeyuuuuge amount of experience with these games. Mindboggling. Like over 10 years worth. JW hits the nail on the head. I know there has to be some way to reach these folks with new ideas but it's very hard to see why they would want to change what they enjoy and have developed on their own over a long period of time.<br/>

Interestingly, there are all kinds of crazy subdivisions within the community just like there are in mainstream gaming. The Star Trek simmers have a whole different set of insane ideas than the Harry Potter yahoogroups types.  Soap opera roleplayers versus anime roleplayers. God bless the Internet.                        </div>

                            I'm on JD's level of experience, and I've spent a LOT of time thinking about this.  One thing you need to take into account is why these people play.  Here are some of the strongest motivations:<br/><br/>a) Flirting and sexual relationships<br/>b) Social networking/making friends<br/>c) Avatarism (character serves as wish fulfillment for and is thoroughly interwoven with player)<br/>d) Showing off one's writing skill and other ego boosts<br/><br/>None of these motivations are helped with additional rules.  Note that these motivations are not mutually exclusive and that a player's particular motivation at a particular time differs and can depend on mood and other factors.<br/><br/>There are other motivations (in the minority) such as expressing creativity and dramatic storytelling, and those might be helped, though I think mostly with techniques rather than rules (such as aggressive scene framing, situation creation, etc.).  <br/><br/>That said, the place where I currently play has a dice roller, people give their character three stats (magic, combat, psionics), and during conflicts they roll to see how well they did.  Some people abuse the lack of guidelines for how exactly to use the system by just declaring three attacks and rolling thrice at one time, etc.  But overall Lisa, who has never played table top in her life and has played character ownership chat games for as long as I have, has suddenly realized that having a random element and defined stats has actually added something to her play experience.<br/><br/>This would usually lead me into my diatribe about the issues with freeform chat play, such as players' comfort zones, but I'll save that up for its own thread sometime. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Why write a new RPG when most folks are good with D&amp;D? <br/><br/>I mean, really. We here write games that might hit, at most 10% of the TT RPG market (and only a tiny fraction of that will buy). And we're worried about whether or not there's a market here? <br/><br/>If you build it, they will play. Some of them anyhow. Make your own market. Given how large a number of people we're talking about, that's a considerable potential market. Even if you only reach a tiny fraction of them. <br/><br/>The far larger problems are ones of addressing the fact that these people almost all tend to believe that rules structures inhibit good play. That's going to be a hard hurdle to overcome. But far from impossible, I'd argue. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Wasn't a large part of the Indie Scene based on the idea that people are playing but are not having fun?<br/><br/>I think this specific crowd is happy with what it has.

I mean, yeah it might kill the magic for some folks. But, so do a lot of things. In all fairness, a lot of TT RPGers get freaked out by looking under the hood, too, but that doesn't stop folks around these parts from doing exactly that and designing games around what they find under there.

I'm not sure how that precludes observation and the drawing of conclusions. Asking informants questions is only one part of that.<br/><br/>Xenopulse named off four major motivators, but drew the conclusion that rules would not enhance the players enjoyment Are we sure that this conclusion is the correct one?                        </div>

                            Well, even if they're relatively happy doing things the way they are, that still potentially leaves room for improvement.  I suspect there is certainly room for design of one sort or another to make their lives better.  The bigger hurdle to me seems to be reaching them.  <br/><br/>Christian and JD here seem to have a fair amount of experience in this -- and Christian at least noted improvement from adding a randomizer system.  <br/><br/>Remember, though, that these games take place under very different social context than face-to-face tabletop play.  The most critical is that people drop on and off all the time, both temporarily and permanently.  People also don't know each other when they start playing.  That changes things enormously.  I suspect that an improved online system may look more like the current homegrown systems than published tabletop RPGs.  But really, I'd defer to Christian and JD on this.  <br/><br/>Any thoughts, you two, on what could improve online play for you?                        </div>

                            Shreyas, have you read <a href="http://www.thesmerf.com/blog/41-interview-with-sarah-kahn-online-freeform-play" rel="nofollow"><b>Thomas' interview with Sarah Kahn</b></a>?  Because it's <b>all kinds of awesome</b> and talks about how different freeform groups work.<br/><br/>Also, I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the way we are speaking on behalf of all these diverse groups of people.  I mean, I can certainly talk from my experience with the groups that I've been involved with, but not about groups that I know nothing about.  And there are a lot of those.  So can we stop doing so much generalization about what they do and don't like?                        </div>

You go native. You find such a community or two and begin playing with them, their way.<br/><br/>Then after some time you extract yourself, view your opinions and form a basis.

                            By no means am I absolutely committed to the idea that there is nothing that can be marketed to this population that they'll buy. On the contrary, I have the gut feeling that they're the Next Big Thing. But I have to recognize that this is only my gut feeling.  God help me if I can point to anything that makes that even remotely plausible.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly agree with xeno's list, although it's not exhaustive. <br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing I'd add is celebration of the source material. And it has to be a certain kind of source material.  There's a reason there's one million Buffy "simming" groups and few or none based on, say, the writings of Mickey Spillane. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some observations and then some thoughts. I could go on and on. If people have specific questions that would help:<br/>
<br/>
Observations:<br/>
<br/>
1. This population skews young. Sometimes VERY young, sometimes much younger than you might think from the level of writing. I have been extremely surprised by the level of writing that a 13 year old can produce.  But remember the adage about source material being so important. They have put a lot of energy into the source material which might be more sophisticated than they "naturally" are, this allows them to fly on a higher level.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  The primary "game balance" concern of most groups (as gamers would understand it) is fairness, not equality. In other words, it is not necessary that everyone have the same "power level" or skill level or whatnot, so long as there is acknowledgments of all characters' strengths and weaknesses. Groups are typically highly sensitive to one person stealing too much spotlight.  Even 13 year old girls these days know what a Mary Sue is and are trying not to put it in too much.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The crossover between fanfic writing and play-by-post, yahoogroups play and "simming" is absolutely enormous.  In practice, they're very similar. People often use characters and situations from one in the other.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Players often play the same characters in many different forums, recycling the "application" for the character in the same way. <br/>
<br/>
Areas where damn near every one of these games could use improvement:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Player dropout is ENORMOUS.  Damn near every enterprise of this kind dies due to people just not posting anymore, plotlines falling fallow, etc. My yahoogroups list is full, full to bursting, with games I felt were neat, that I posted on actively for a few months, but then everyone started to drizzle away and it became "talking to the void".<br/>
<br/>
2.  Conflict is avoided assiduously, to the degree that players are in general highly reluctant to introduce conflict even to drive the story further (or at all). I, with my background in pulp fiction and paperbacks, have absolutely no problem sending in four guys with guns to make my character's life hard, but I am an exception. (This may be connected to the very-young thing above? I remember in high school my fics were essentially character interaction with no conflict whatsoever.)<br/>
<br/>
3.  Conversations between characters take forever compared to actions.  A conversation can go back and forth tediously and painfully. Actions can be described quickly and extensively.  (Conversations bogging down is one thing that leads to #1 having a huge impact, if the other person doesn't reply to your conversational post for like 3 weeks, you may be completely out of the loop.)<br/>
<br/>
There are also genre/field-specific questions. I have been playing in my first Star Trek sim, and there are all kinds of weird artifacts in that thing that I have been trying to figure out.  I made a character more or less along the lines of Dr. Cox from Scrubs or House from the eponymous show, someone who is highly talented but stays more or less at the bottom of the pecking order due to being an insensitive, regulations-ignoring jerk.  Yet because I wrote posts regularly, my character got promoted at the end of a mission. It had nothing to do with what the character did, in fact what the character did should have gotten him demerits and scrubber duty or whatever they do in Star Trek, but because I had out-of-character contributed to the mission, my guy went up a rank. I see what they're trying to do - reward people in-character for helping keep the game going out-of-character - but what consequences does that have for the person that wants to play the Really Bad Officer Who Never Should Have Been Assigned Here?<br/>
<br/>
Gads, I could go on more and more.  Specific questions would help.                        </div>

                            That's a cool idea. If I were going to run one of these games, I would want threading capability, character sheet capability, a chat window and calendar to help with conversation-doing, and you could certainly work in a plot pacing sort of thing for when to introduce conflict, uncertainty, etc. You could load one of those 15 or so preplanned plots that we thought up in the other thread...                        </div>

<p>Of course, the more you put stuff in play to enforce pacing and conflict, the more you run into the problem where every group of two or more players has different software needs, and then you have to either keep customizing the thing or templatize it so they all become programmers a little bit, and then you spiral off into enlessly-configurable framework hell...</p>

                            Mike, you just described TinyMUSH.<br/><br/>The in-character rewards for out-of-character reliability and loyalty thing is <em>huge</em>.  Nearly any hierarchy in these games is built on activity and to a lesser extent popularity, hardly ever player skill.  I have a friend who specifically played a ditzy-headed idiot sidhe and was made Duchess cause she'd been around the longest.  It leads to some very odd situations.                        </div>

                            Certainly there is not a lot of conscious design to these games.  Typically any design that goes on (character applications, etc.) is copied from previous games.  Most participants are reactive rather than proactive - see my previous comments about being reluctant to introduce conflict.  Remember: this population skews really really really young.  <br/>
<br/>
And hell yes it could be improved! I am just not sure I could think of a product that will improve it.  (And that is not to say that someone else couldn't.)<br/>
<br/>
I strongly disagree that MMORPG is scratching this itch. There is no Buffy MMORPG.  There is no Harry Potter MMORPG. Celebration of source material and the "fanfic experience" being so very central to this sort of play there is really no adequate "generic" substitute.                        </div>

                            My experience has been there's a huge peak between 13 and 20, and it tapers off after that. Certainly there are plenty of twentysomethings playing these games so your experience is totally valid. In fact, I think there's a bit of self-selecting-ness, I tend to get interested in game pitches written by older players, I sort of have to reach out to get interested in What The Kids Are Doing.<br/>

                            I wonder if the skew young has to do with the "committment = status" thing? When I played these kind of games I was roughly 19-22, and I know that lack of free time to keep up with stuff happening at odd times of day (from my time zone) was the end of the line for my fun levels. Compared to weekly TTRPG sessions, a 24/7 global game is a real killer. There are less committment-intensive formats than open BB/usenet play-by-post, which was what I did.                        </div>

                            I just want to second what JD and Christian said about the motivations that seem to inform this play -- I think "celebrating the material" is a crucial insight, and any system that is going to be successful for these groups will absolutely have to focus on colour and genre to a much greater degree. These people want to produce something exactly like the best parts of these shows/books/etc. -- they want to recreate Buffy with or without the numbers filed off. It's not about coming up with awesome stories in general -- it's about coming up with exactly the right kind of awesome story, with the same balance of elements as the original. <br/><br/>While my experience is primarily with MUSHing, most of MUSH play is essentially freeform. The desire to perfectly simulate the source material is extremely strong -- to the point that a huge amount of player drama is the result of disagreements about how things would really work, or whether what is happening is consistent with each player's view of said source material. Concerns about whether it makes for a good story are secondary, and any variation from the accepted material is interpreted as an attempt to hog the spotlight. Of course, there is rarely any concensus about what part of the source material is acceptable -- I figure this is less of an issue with games based of TV series, since they have a much clearer canon than say, comic books or the WoD.<br/><br/>As far as how these groups play, I think they play using a series of conventions that are enforced with extreme social prejudice. However, as mentioned, each group appears to have its own conventions, and the conventions themselves appear to develop organically. There is almost zero self-examination of these conventions or their possible impact on play -- they are simply "the right way to play," and disagreement is grounds for divorce. They can range from extremely specific -- a wide variety of them concern writing style, including first or third person, allowed tenses, etc. -- to very vague ("no metagaming") and are enforced through the usual Internet-social means.<br/><br/>Edit: I also wanted to add that I don't think it's fair to say these people are all happy and having a perfect little gaming experience. I imagine this is more true of some of the bboard/yahoo groups, but if MU*ing is any indication, they are also full of people totally dissatisfied with what is going on and absolutely no idea how to change things for the better.                        </div>

                            I do want to point out, just in case some people are getting the wrong impression: MU* play and most asynchronous online freeform play are pretty different from one another.  Perhaps to a degree that approaches the difference between each of them and tabletop play.  We should be careful not to lump everyone into the same categories, since that's going to lead to sweeping (and inaccurate) generalizations.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that anyone has done so, but I do think that some of the comments in this thread could be read that way.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

It's a lot about involvement. MMORPGs are a lot less about story, you come to an area where there'd been a war 10 hours ago and it's fresh for something new.<br/><br/>In freeforming chat you miss something, you need to catch up. Participants often drop off after a year or two, a year or two of pouring in many daily hours, and then more to catch up with other time zones, especially for non-Americans.<br/><br/>I dunno, the equivalent of those hours by TT roleplayers is enough to fill about 10-20 years of roleplaying.                        </div>

                            Starting an actual play thread about some of my experiences in this community. I'm still happy to answer questions here if anyone who is interested in this market wants to explore a bit?                        </div>

                            I have lots of things to say about the several freeform groups, as I've played in CompuServe forums, on IRC, via different web sites, on MUSHs and MUDs, etc.  I just don't have the time to type it all out these days; I can barely keep up with the posts around here.<br/><br/>The discussion has been interesting thus far, though, so I'll keep tuning in.                        </div>
