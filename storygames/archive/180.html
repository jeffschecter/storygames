                    Thomas Robertson said, in Ludanta Retero:<br/>
<br/>
"How much can the rules leave open to the players to make up and still be a coherent (in the vernacular sense) game?"<br/>
<br/>
Some recent games have started to really push the envelope in this direction.  Court of the Empress and KKKKK are two examples, and I've been told that Wait/Tea is another example.<br/>
<br/>
Let's go for an extreme example.<br/>
<br/>
"Redneck"<br/>
<br/>
Concept: Two players play out a conversation between two idle "all-hat no-cattle" rednecks.  They are waiting for the mail, where they expect some kind of money to arrive.  It doesn't matter what the source of the money is.  I make no apologies to anyone who is offended by this game.  If you are willing to admit that you're an idle all-hat no-cattle redneck, then you deserve all the barbs you feel when you read this game.  I don't recommend playing Redneck as a warm up for any kind of serious RPG, like Toon.<br/>
<br/>
Setup: You need a six-pack of beer.  If you want to go hogwild, get a case.  This is real beer, not imaginary.  This ain't a game for kids.  Oh, and it has to be American beer, too, none of that fantsy-pants expensive European stuff, unless you're actually playing it in Europe.  Likewise you can't use Canadian beer unless you're in Canada.  Have some patriotism.  The cheaper and nastier the beer is, the better.  And if you even THINK of using non-alcoholic beer or soda pop for this game, just don't even read any further.<br/>
<br/>
The players take turns.  Whoever bought the beer goes first.<br/>
<br/>
The first turn, the player cracks open one of the bottles/cans and says something about what he's going to do with the money that's coming.  It doesn't matter if it's a lie or the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Each turn after that, play proceeds in two steps.<br/>
<br/>
The player taking his turn has two choices.  He can either belch, or drink.  If there isn't enough gas in his stomach to belch, he has to drink.<br/>
<br/>
After belching, the player must say something that contradicts what the previous player said.<br/>
<br/>
After drinking, the player must say something that amplifies and/or adds onto what the previous player said.<br/>
<br/>
If, in the act of drinking, the player finishes his bottle or can, then the player throws the bottle or can on the ground, and cracks open a new one.  He may then say something new, about the money he's going to get.  It must be unrelated to any previous statements about his money, or his buddy's.<br/>
<br/>
Under no circumstances can the two rednecks do anything but sit, talk, belch, drink, and wait for the mail.<br/>
<br/>
When the last can is empty, the mail arrives and the two rednecks say goodbye. <br/>
<br/>
If at any time a player becomes too drunk to continue playing, he's a wuss who never should have started playing a man's game in the first place.                </div>

                            Yeah, I guess I got so caught up in writing the damn thing that I forgot the point I was making...<br/>
<br/>
Can a game become so trivial that it's no longer fun?<br/>
<br/>
I am imagining at least a few people (yourself included, Tony) who would say, "Maybe, but Redneck ain't it.  I'd love to play Redneck."<br/>
<br/>
Personally... Redneck isn't very interesting to me.                        </div>

If you're looking for an absurdly trivial game, look up Candyland.  Draw a card, go to the next space of that color.  Do adults play it?                        </div>

I'm looking for absurdly trivial in the opposite direction.  Something that's so locked-down and limited that you're trying to breathe through a soda straw.<br/>

                            Yeah, actually, Vaxalon, Redneck might be a bit amusing. In fact, I have played something very similar to this game before, although we thought we were joking around to pass the time and making fun of rednecks, instead of dealing with the provocative themes this game arouses.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I sorta see what you're getting at, but then I don't again.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, you talk about "leaving things open to the players" but then both KKKKK and Redneck here are very tightly conscripted games that leave very little open to the players.  Play takes place in a very narrow band that tells a very specific type of story.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think "trying to breathe through a soda straw" is the best metaphor here, though it might feel like that if people came in expecting something like a traditional RPG.  <br/>
<br/>
I would say it's more like telling your kids the story of Red Ridinghood.  You can tell it however you want, but the basic storyline is more or less fixed and the major events are known.  Even some of the lines ("Grandma, what big teeth you have!") are scripted.  The fun, then, is in the details and in the actual performance of it.  It's not about "what do we do next?" because you have clear guidelines for figuring that out (unlike most RPGs).  Instead it's about doing it and how you decide to do it.                        </div>

bq. RPGs are a trickier project because of the nebulous nature of the creative result. When you're making a board game, you can place all sorts of restrictions on play without players complaining. An RPG, however, feels more like an incomplete board game, or more accurately, a board game where lack of restrictions are part of the design itself. Like jazz, an RPG system is as much about the rules you don't design as the rules you do.                        </div>

                            There's no objectively true answer to this question for all cases. What'll happen is that the lighter the weight gets, the more people will say "this is too trivial for me", just as the more removed a game gets from the standard ones of its kind, the more people will say "this no longer seems like an X game to me". But that may or may not matter to you. What matters is what the folks who you'd like to reach think, and that's quite a different matter.<br/><br/>I don't think there's necessarily a genuine minimum or maximum, even when you get your purpose for a particular project clearly defined. Just what people think.                        </div>
