(that's a link to a "build your own!" PDF. I may have some pre-assembled copies for sale at some point.) Now, being that it's a game that I wrote, there's actually a fair chunk of thought going into the rules, but still, it's not like it's an agonizing process or anything. It's mostly funny. I didn't playtest it: in fact, it says so right in the book "This is an ashcan, which is indie-gamese for 'I didn't do any playtesting.'"<br/><br/>So we've got an hour to kill at GPNW after playing Sugarfighter Black and we're like "what can we do" and I'm like "we can play XXXXtreme STREET luge." And, much to my surprise, Lukas and Lesley and Joe go "yeah, okay."<br/><br/>We played it. My guy is called "Velocaraptor" or Bob and he works sometimes at the club and he's got a bad complexion and he's really too old to be friends with the rest of the characters. He wants to get a steady job, take a night class at community college, and take a road trip to Providence (birthplace of the Gravity Games, natch.) Other people are likewise. Joe's guy (Gorehammer?) wants to lose his virginity, lose his virginity again, and learn good penmanship. Lukas's guy wants to get a new shift at his job at the Dairy Queen.<br/><br/>The thing that happens is that these characters are kinda losers, but you really get attached to them because they're fundamentally decent and just a little too into their microcelebrity sport. You want to see them get their lives together, like, super-bad, and because the rules are against them, they fail all the time. It was really heart-warming, at least for me, and it was also funny as hell.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><i>"Hey, man, so that cop was totally yelling at you. What did you say to him to calm him down?"<br/><br/>"Dude, cops have to deal with all sorts of shit every day: drugs, violence, crime. It's rough. So I just talked to him as one extreme dude to another and we worked it out."</i><br/><br/>Playing the game has convinced me that playtesting is really over-rated. I've had a lot less fun with a lot more playtested games. What you need is just to make sure that your rules aren't mathematically wonky and that they're definitely doing what you want them to, and probably it'll work out fine from there.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147282/#Comment_147282" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T10:32:22+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 10:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That game was super fun.

I can't decide whether that one or the DQ scene was the best bullshit scene. (for those playing along at home: bullshit scenes are all the scenes which aren't about street luge.)<br/><br/>The Angel of Death was hardcore. She totally owned us in the luge.
