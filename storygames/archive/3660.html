(Jason, you need to come up with a succinct term for this method quick!)<br/><br/>Many apologies to Mr. Morningstar for my shameless ripoffery, but I tried adapting the idea for Do with the following results.<br/><br/>I discovered that scenes in Do are essentially the same as in Jason's original format, but with the addition of a Teacher and Student who intervene in an attempt to resolve a conflict between primary and secondary characters. (Other differences and notes are in <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/588067.html" rel="nofollow">this LJ-post</a>.)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/Do/Do-Card-01.gif"/><br/><br/>The <i>teacher</i> is the pilgrim who would teach for that scene. The <i>student</i> is the pilgrim who would learn something for that scene. The same name is put on the index card to avoid situations where a pilgrim would teach themselves. In the teacher corner, the name has the title of "Sifu," or "Teacher." In the student corner, the name has the title of "Pilgrim."<br/><br/>The two <i>residents</i> are NPCs inspired by the letter. Residents may appear more than once on different cards if players find that character particularly interesting. This leaves open the possibility that the resident would be in conflict with themselves, which might be juicy.<br/><br/>And finally, the <i>conflict</i> is the type of argument the residents have with one another. <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/575370.html?nc=29" rel="nofollow">The conflict-symbols</a> stamped on the letter are suggestions, but you can write down whichever of the seven symbols you wish.<br/><br/>This is an example of three cards already filled out:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/Do/Do-Card-02.gif"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/Do/Do-Card-03.gif"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/Do/Do-Card-04.gif"/><br/><br/>And this is how the cards are put together to frame a scene:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/Do/Do-Card-05.gif"/><br/><br/>The relevant elements are in black. This scene is framed by <i>Sifu Ready Glass</i> teaching a lesson to <i>Pilgrim Poetic Bell</i>. The central conflict of the scene is between the <i>Queen of the Land</i> and <i>The Ravenous Beast!</i> The conflict is one of <i>Sword</i>, meaning that it involves affairs of violence, war, and weaponry. The location of the scene is in <i>The Poor Side of Town</i>.<br/><br/>Rotating the cards produces this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/Do/Do-Card-06.gif"/><br/><br/>In this scene, <i>Sifu Poetic Bell</i> teaches a lesson to <i>Pilgrim Burning Fresco</i> by resolving a <i>Conflict of Heart</i> between <i>A Talking Frog</i> and <i>The Ravenous Beast</i> in <i>The Castle</i>.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm amazed at how naturally this technique produces an emergent, Clue-like syntax for scene-framing.<br/><br/>I'm interested to see how other designers might adapt the concept to suit their projects, or how gamers would use it to suit their particular playstyles. How would you tweak it for your game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82180/#Comment_82180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T05:18:19+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  5:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's super cool, Daniel.

Even if you don't have colored cards available, you could at least write in big ol' letters "CHARACTER" or "SITUATION" on the cards to help distinguish them.<br/><br/>Andrew, I had posted an idea for card-drafting character creation and scene-framing, but Jason's idea was waaaay more elegant and didn't require me to actually design any cards.<br/><br/>It had been suggested that I use playing cards for the resolution as well, but I didn't feel they evoked the right atmosphere. I'm presently hacking Jared Sorensen's Color Wheel with the Pool, plus some mechanics for Buddhist-style burdens that Ben Lehman suggested. It'd still be nice to integrate the scene-framing process with the actual resolution mechanics though, just haven't quite figured out how to do that yet.<br/><br/>But I feel like we're talking too much about Do. I'd really like to hear more about how you'd adapt the Index Card Idea to other games.<br/><br/>How would you adapt it for Shadowrun, for example? Perhaps the sides of the card are Character, Patron, MacGuffin, Obstacle? Maybe you'd arrange them in a certain way so that each "level" of the run involved a new character and a new obstacle so that everyone would get a chance to shine as they pursued the same trinket? Heck, you could remove obstacle and just make that another character, so Shadowrun becomes a competition between 1337 runners.<br/><br/>The idea might even be used for games with great settings but no clear thing for players to <i>do</i>, like Transhuman Space.

My chief concern would be fiddly-ness, in that you are passing along a preparatory burden onto the players - for optimum play, you need to go buy multi-colored index cards instead of using whatever you have around the house.  I have a killer game design that resolves conflicts using tear-off raffle tickets.  I love it, but do I want to make people buy a wheel of raffle tickets to play?   It's a minor point.<br/><br/>Daniel, I think if you are playing THS, asking that question would be a great way to figure out <i>what you want to do</i> in the THS universe.

(It's why I'm so fond of using d6s for board games since they can be used as randomizers and game pieces.)<br/><br/>Jason: It does seem that situation and motivation are the most likely things to be changed or refined for any particular setting. For Transhuman Space, I'd probably swap "Meme" for motivation. (There's a whole supplement of nothing but memes.) And... hmm... situation is a toughy. This might be a cop-out, but what if situation was <i>another</i> meme? The scene's Situation emerges from these two Memes either interacting or conflicting with each other via Characters in a Location. Is that pushy enough?

That is, the entire play took place within a single day, the stage represented one place throughout the play, and there was only one plotline with no subplots.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Much as the classical unities were a reductive idea overzealously imitated, they can be useful tools in fixing this problem. To put it simply, a \xe2\u20ac\u2122scene\xe2\u20ac\u2122 in Full Light, Full Steam should possess at least two of the three unities, and should probably start off with all three.</blockquote>\nHe goes into more detail, but in general it seems like a good fit for this method. Have everyone write down a place, a time and an action on the cards.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/FLFS-01.gif"/><br/><br/>Then you can arrange them frame FLFS scenes according to the three unities that Joshua described.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v61/gobi90/FLFS-02.gif"/><br/><br/>From this, I'd be tempted to introduce a house rule that I <i>think</i> would make scenes quite epic.<br/><br/><b>Act Framing</b><br/>Each combination of time+place+action is a distinct Scene. A collection of Scenes is called an Act. In Full Light, Full Steam, the Scenes within an Act all either share the same time and place, time and action, or place and action, but <i>never</i> all three.<br/><br/>To frame a Scene, place three cards together [as shown in the previous image]. The Scene now has a time, place and action. This is the status quo from which further Scenes in this Act will deviate. If everyone who wants to resolve the Scene has had a chance to do so [by whatever means offered by the system], but have not yet <i>succeeded</i> in doing so, one of these unities must change. Only this unity may change until the Act is complete.<br/><br/>For example, the Act begins with a Scene featuring <b>Diplomatic Negotiations</b> at <b>Her Majesty's Lunar Base</b> in <b>Dead of Night</b>. The Scene goes unresolved, for whatever reason, and a player decides that Time will be the unity that changes throughout this Act. So, after every unresolved Scene, the location and action remain the same, but the action continues over the course of many time periods. The negotiations have lasted until <b>Lunchtime</b>. Swap the card again, and the negotiations continue until <b>Dawn</b>. A montage, basically.<br/><br/>Where it gets epic is when Acts have same action and time, but swap out location. You have an opening Scene of <b>Gunplay</b> in the <b>Cockpit of a Zepellin</b> at <b>Dawn</b>. If it goes unresolved, the gunplay continues into <b>Her Majesty's Lunar Base</b>. If still unresolved, the gun battle proceeds into an <b>Opera House</b>. Pretty cool, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
