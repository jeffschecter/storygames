Although our 2nd edition home-brew campaign extended for decades (Jesus), we played less and less often because of time- I didn't have the time to do all that prep anymore, and none of us had the time for 8+ hour sessions that old style D&amp;D pretty much requires.  But this weekend I rolled out Dungeon World. <br/><br/>There were three of us playing, and we had roughly 2.5 hours. I offered them Dungeon World and Fiasco; I knew I could run Fiasco and it would be fun, and I made it clear that DW was really a playtest that I was still figuring out. They didn't care, they saw character sheets and polyhedrals and theirs eyes got all misty.<br/><br/>I told them they would be starting in a swamp environment. I explained how moves worked and they liked the simplicity. They chose the Paladin and Ranger classes and worked through character creation. By the time my explanations were done and characters were ready (maybe 45 minutes), my friends were already sold on the game.<br/><br/>We played through some initial moves to get them started- "Undertake a perilous journey" moves for both of them, leading to an encounter with lizard men defending their territory. Some ordering of hirelings, "Discern Realities" to spot the ambush, "Pull a Stunt" to get around it, lots of hacking and slashing, making a stand, more stunts. They ended up defeating seven 1st level monsters pretty handily, taking a few points of damage each and getting about 7 XPs between them.<br/><br/>We played on for a bit, with some exploration, spouting lore, etc., essentially setting up for the next session- there was no question we'd be playing again and continuing with the adventure.<br/><br/>For my part, my prep consisted of some idle thinking the night before about an adventure setting and some potential "fronts" (by which I mean monsters and traps they might encounter, and a bit of an overall "motivation" for the dungeon). When they were making characters, I fleshed this out by giving the monsters some stats and moves. <br/><br/>I used the Apocalypse World style of combat, which just makes more sense to me. We didn't bother with initiative, and my moves were mostly responses to theirs (answering their failed Hack and Slash with "deal damage according to the threat", for example). I did also offer opportunities and show portents of doom, to good effect.<br/><br/>So, tl;dr, the game was short but worked out really well, and left us wanting more. I'm excited that Sage and Adam are breaking it out in it's own direction because I think it boils down some of the best aspects of AW and marries it to the "comfort food" feel of traditional fantasy gaming.<br/><br/>Some questions for other DW (and AW by extension) GMs: <br/><br/>1) Do you generally describe the fictional results of a PC move (after move options have been chosen), or let the player narrate their own success or failure?<br/><br/>2) I'll be running this again in a convention slot for Dreamation; would the game benefit from some "Love letter" starting points (as Vincent used for Hatchet City), or does the DW character creation and bonds cover that well enough in your experience?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311468/#Comment_311468" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T10:06:43+00:00" title="February  7, 2011 10:06AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 10:06AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and Sage?

Thanks so much for your AP report.  <br/><br/>Reading these sorts of things are so great for me, personally.  Especially the bits about gamers who associate their D&amp;D experience as a particular kind of nostalgic remembrance of old-school dungeon crawlery and then finding that feeling again in the slimy embrace of Dungeon World.  Misty-eyed college-friend gamers, we salute you!<br/><br/>As for your questions, here are my thoughts.  <br/><br/>1) Generally, AW seems to me to have a fairly traditional feel for its descriptions.  The player says "I am going to do X" and the GM says "it sounds like you are using a Move!" and then dice are rolled and the GM describes the effects of success or failure of X.  Of course, you're always welcome to have your players pipe in with how they'd do it or with flavour but the dice describe the effects - everything else is window-dressing.  That's going to vary based on how your group generally jibes with one another.<br/><br/>2) The bonds cover character relationships but don't necessarily fill in all the backstory.  If I were running Dungeon World at a convention (oh, "if" as though it were a thing that never happens) I would leave all the character creation alone, letting the players build their bonds and the world via their moves, but then maybe hand out a "love letter" to describe the story so far.  To in-media-res the game a little bit.  It'll help you introduce your Fronts (and yes, these are coming!) without a lot of "you're in a tavern, a wizard tells you a story that takes me an hour to tell to set up the adventure" and lets you jump right in.<br/><br/>You might have a letter that says "you're in a dungeon with a bunch of your adventurer comrades, but things have taken a turn for the worse!" and have them roll a move to establish just what bad things have happened to put them in a rough spot, miles underground, with but a torch and a 10' pole to their name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311539/#Comment_311539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T14:34:43+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  2:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread along with the new DW I downloaded earlier makes me want to grab a micro-dungeon and play, like right now.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311568/#Comment_311568" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T19:43:10+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  7:43PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 7:48PM by sage.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, welcome to the Adventurer's Guild, Steve! (I actually already had you on my list of people to invite, but I still love reading AP. Also, Jason - I don't have an email for you, but you've posted before, so just let me know what email to send an invite to)<br/><br/>Oh man. Love letter. Miles underground with only a torch and a 10' pole. Yes.<br/><br/>As far as who describes the outcome... We don't make that clear in the text (which makes it clear it's still a work in progress, though we've announced where we're heading). Adam's right: I tend to fall into a more D&amp;D style when running DW, where the player says what they do, makes the move, and chooses an outcome, but then I describe it. No reason why player description wouldn't work though, so long as everyone's following the move.<br/><br/>My person favorite way to start a DW con game is with the party (all held together by their Bonds) at the entrance to the Purple Worm Graveyard, which holds the promise of great riches. DW tends to fit into a con slot easier than AW does, so just making characters and jumping into the action works fine. Having said that, I had never though of a GM Love Letter for con games, but now I'm in love with it.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for playing, glad you had a good time! We'll keep making it better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
