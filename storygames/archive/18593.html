Miles attended this year and played many amazing things with fascinating and wonderful people. It involved lots of feelings, some of which he shares. The rest will cost you.<br/><br/>Ken and Tanya then share informed opinions on their recent viewing of World War Z (rather than the rank speculation we featured last episode). Fortunately, we were correct in our low expectations for the film \u2013 both our reviewers were disappointed and en(nerd)raged.<br/><br/>Finishing off this episode is a quick bringing-up-to-speed on the \u201cGrope Crew\u201d garbage that surfaced at AKON last month, and a little talk around how the Equestria Girls spinoff (and the sexualization of MLP in general) squicks Miles the fuck out.
