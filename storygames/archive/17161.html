I am currently thinking a lot about an AW hack (as I\u2019m sure nearly everyone here has), and I\u2019d really like to actually have something come out of all my mental doodling. <br/><br/>But this thread isn\u2019t about an actual hack -- this thread is about how best to introduce that hack, how to talk about it, how to make people aware of it. There are likely parallels here with what you\u2019d do for any new game, AW hack or not, but as I\u2019m still inexperienced enough to not know best practices either way, I thought a thread specifically about the introduction of an AW hack would be most helpful.<br/><br/>Also, there are clearly different levels of hack, where some hacks are neat little .pdfs people make and release for free, while others are full-blown book length texts that are aimed toward publishing. I think I\u2019m looking for more information on hacks that are ultimately going to be big ol\u2019 projects, requiring plenty of time and effort to really function, but I would value any and all information. <br/><br/>So. Here are three of my questions, to get started.<br/><br/>(1) At what point should you mention you\u2019re working on the hack? When you\u2019ve had the idea? When you have some major work done? When you have something to show to people? <br/><br/>(2) Where should you mention your hack? As many places as possible? Personal blog, AW forums, here on story-games? Just in threads, saying, \u201cHey! I\u2019m working on a cool thing. Check it out!\u201d<br/><br/>(3) How much of your hack should you release at any given point? Creative processes differ between people, but as much as they can be generalized, do you think that you should be willing to talk about anything and everything concerning the hack, as soon as you think of it? Should you keep any ideas close to your chest, so you can refine them, perfect them, without comment that might distract you or detract from what you had really hoped to accomplish with them? Does the fact that this is an AW hack, and AW is already well known, mean that it's a better or worse idea to release your own (hopefully) new and interesting ideas for the hack sooner rather than later?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389300/#Comment_389300" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T09:02:55+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  9:02AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you want to talk about your Apocalypse World Hack <b>roll+design</b>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389302/#Comment_389302" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T09:17:03+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  9:17AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I think that VB has some good advice here:<br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=380.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=380.0</a><br/>and guidelines here:<br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=29.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=29.0</a><br/><br/>I kinda fell into doing the Traveller World hack (which is of the simple + little variety) but it still took lots of work.

If you're releasing an AW hack, that probably means playing a lot of AW, playing a lot of different AW hacks, and talking to people who know a lot about AW, AW hacks, and publishing AW hacks.<br/><br/>P.S. You don't need anyone's permission to make a game. But if you release something that has issues and haven't thought to get help from anyone who might have been able to help you avoid those issues, then you'll have to be prepared to deal with criticism. As a game publisher, you have to deal with criticism anyway, but you can take measures beforehand to make sure you've dealt with as many potential issues as you can and want to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389320/#Comment_389320" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T11:11:43+00:00" title="September  5, 2012 11:11AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before he announces what it's about, I'd just like to say <b>SHOTTY SUPERHEROES!</b> *ahem* Thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389327/#Comment_389327" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T11:43:49+00:00" title="September  5, 2012 11:43AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Before he announces what it's about, I'd just like to say <b>SHOTTY SUPERHEROES!</b> *ahem* Thanks.</blockquote>\nWell, what about "shoddy superheroes"? What if my hack is about THAT? Huh? Whatcha gonna do? <br/><br/>Thanks for the link to those posts, Rob, and the advice, Jon and Pete! I do need to think more about the specific parameters and goals of my own project in order to best answer the "what makes sense?" question. <br/><br/>A lot of what I'm trying to figure out is the result of noticing the number of surprised posts regarding <i>tremulus</i>, in which people said things like, "I've never heard of this before," "this was developed entirely in the dark," and therefore seemed mistrustful of it. I'm wondering how one should avoid that situation. It seems like a good answer, so far, is simply to talk about it, in whatever way best suits the project, and ask questions about sausage-making. Metaphorically. <br/><br/>Also...\n<blockquote>Make sure you at least give some examples of your work before asking for large amounts of money, or people are going to be skeptical.</blockquote>\nAre you sure? That's not how I understood Kickstarter. As long as I put together some kind of video, I thought that everybody would be obligated to give me money. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how it works. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389330/#Comment_389330" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T11:50:50+00:00" title="September  5, 2012 11:50AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yo dawg, just 'cause you jumped out of planes as research for your rpg, doesn't mean people want it <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/917876657/republishing-synnibarr-the-original-scifi-fantasy/?ref=kicktraq" rel="nofollow">back in print.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389331/#Comment_389331" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T12:09:16+00:00" title="September  5, 2012 12:09PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Relevant?:<br/><br/>After spending over a year of my life working on an Apocalypse World hack, I stood back and squinted a bit.

Some hacks only really need playbooks that are 10 words long, but the AW precedent locks people into thinking that they need to make them multiple pages long.

My personal take is that I want full playbooks complete with special moves, tweaked and honed basic moves, and the couple of additional rules systems I want to include to flesh the game out, so I'm definitely working on the assumption that my ideas are landing on the "more" end of things. <br/><br/>Obviously, this is going to be specific to particular games, but if you have any examples, I'd love to hear them. For example, I'd assume Monsterhearts is on the "more" end of things, as well. What was it that made you go for that "more" end? Was it something that occurred to you in discussion with others? Something you knew from the get-go? Something that just arose the more you worked on your fundamental idea? <br/><br/>World of Dungeons is pretty clearly a "less", and it definitely works for me as such. But I'm not sure exactly where that decision was made...when in its creation...and why. <br/><br/>(Maybe this is a different topic...am I allowed to hijack my own thread?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389346/#Comment_389346" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T14:31:52+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  2:31PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can really see where you are coming from wrt full playbooks, moves etc. For me WoD is just too bare bones.

The stuff Michael did with World of Warhammer is a great middle ground that has both depth and simplicity, for example.<br/><br/>Here's my favorite Vincent post about AW: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=594" rel="nofollow">Concentric Game Design</a>.<br/><br/>Here's a thing I wrote, inspired by it:\n<blockquote>If you are designing a game with a GM-like role...<br/><br/>1. Start with AW, but with no PC moves. Just the MC stuff.<br/><br/>2. Alter MC Agendas/Principles/AlwaysSays/MCMoves to reflect the style of play you have in mind.<br/><br/>3. Recognise that this is a completely functional game. Consider playing it. Maybe the game is done now.<br/><br/>4. Distill categories of player actions into principled freeform moves ("when you do x, it turns out like y"), no dice and no mechanics, just descriptions ("when you inflict violence, it's messy, complicated, and unproductive").<br/><br/>5. Recognise that this is a completely functional game. Consider playing it. Maybe the game is done now.<br/><br/>6. Begin turning principled freeform moves into other types of moves if the moves are not fully satisfying. Probably only do this a few moves at a time so that you can...<br/><br/>7. Test the moves in small batches by continuing to actually play the game. Sometimes one new move may render previously "finished" moves to be less perfect. Game design is hard. But the simpler and fewer your moves are (and the better thought-out they are) the easier it is to avoid these kinds of upsets. Sometimes it's necessary to shake the foundation, though. Or replace an established move with a principled freeform move and start over.<br/><br/>8. Eventually you can declare the game "done" or stop working on it. But your players and fans will probably continue the above process without you, either way.<br/><br/>Notice that <b>at no point in the design process is the game not completely playable</b>. This is critical. My advice: keep releasing playable drafts so other folks can enjoy your game while you continue to work on it. <br/><br/>Also: <b>you now have no excuse not to be playing your game</b>, if that's what you really want to be doing (and, really, why else design a game?). "It's not done yet" doesn't cut it anymore. If you don't like some things and can't think of anything better yet, just replace those portions with principled freeform moves until you get a new brainwave.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389364/#Comment_389364" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T17:52:45+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  5:52PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, JW.
