She'd tried D&amp;D before, though, didn't like it, and so asked me to play something with her that was "more like Apocalypse World." Here came World of Dungeons which was all that I wanted and no more!<br/><br/>I got my hands on B1 - In Search of the Unknown and on one martini-drenched afternoon we played until I couldn't describe the dungeon in anything but a wizard voice. Her character, Wester the wizard, negotiated with magic mouths, stomped centipedes, found hidden golden coins in the mouth of a demonic idol by sacrificing a rat to it, and befriended an orc (who she's named Gruk) before being severely wounded by kobolds and being chased into a stairwell and barricading the entrance. She has only explored maybe 4 or 5 rooms in the 50+ room dungeon and she's having a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384232/#Comment_384232" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T13:41:44+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  1:41PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The SundaySkypers wrapped up their Spirit of the Century story arc and damn if we didn't leave chomping at the bit for more.

After getting past an imperial blockade and navigating the Remnants, Lady Blackbird finally arrives at the lair of Uriah Flint.  He is shocked to see her.  She first met him after he kidnapped her, they fell in love, and she convinced her parents to pay his ransom.  Turns out only one of them was in love, but the other is in love with the idea of trying to ransom Lady Blackbird again.  She offers a toast to Uriah\u2019s unexpected good fortune, but as he goes to drink it, she infuses the wine with lightning.  Simultaneously, Snargle has shrunk himself to less than an inch tall and glided his way into Uriah\u2019s mouth.  The pirate king drinks the electrified wine and falls to the floor convulsing.  Snargle re-enlarges himself and uses his mimic ability to perfectly mirror Flint.  <br/><br/>So the final scene of our game is Uriah Flint writhing on the ground as a perfect replica of himself bursts out his chest.  \u201cWell,\u201d Lady Blackbird says to Snargle/Flint, \u201cLooks like this is your ship now.\u201d  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bad.

The crime-lord and engineer strike a deal, and as he stands up his coat opens; green jewels pour out.

From there everything falls to pieces - the feminist revolutionary attempts to blast her way through the convict auxiliary to get the sables on the return ship (there's no way they're letting the women go); the bumbling marine is installed as Dimber Damber after he smears the new one's reputation; others die, rise, fall.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an awesome story that come together collaboratively, with no prep.

It is still a haul worth 250,000 credits, more with a good broker.  We lift off from the surface counting our blessings...only to have the repairs to the ship fail!

Most importantly, that it can work with just two players and one GM, and pretty well too). My session with Ken Hite and Irwin was an awesome one, with sufficient crying and stabbing, extreme photojournalism, arms dealers and fox-spirits.<br/>One session of <a href="http://www.tenra-rpg.com" rel="nofollow">Tenra Bansho Zero</a><br/>One session of <a href="http://www.j-rpg.com/ryuutama" rel="nofollow">Ryuutama</a>, which was VERY fun, but I feel like I gave Krista too much paperwork as the merchant.<br/><br/>A theme that came up recently was "moai heads", which is one of the monsters in Ryuutama, in the "Demon Stone" monster type. The travelers worked slowly towards a city on the shore, only to be attacked by two flying moai heads. They also had an ale-drinking contest with four catgoblins, which they won pretty much instantly. Matt's "Handsome Hansel" blacksmith with an iron church bell strapped to his back, and Adrian's anime healer-boy were some very fun and interesting characters. <br/><br/>Yesterday, my bi-weekly Ryuutama group had to deal with the town's vampire rabbit problem. Because I was on a big Moai kick, it turns out that the vampire rabbits were actually controlled by a VAMPIRE MOAI HEAD. Which shot circle beams at the players like in Gradius. The players overcame the obstacle, and collected a few pelts plus a stone large shield (qualities: Sturdy, gross); this let them finally buy some armor!<br/><br/>Boring monsters?

Lobster, the Chopper, has taken some of his boys down the way to buy fuel for their snowmobiles from their usual place, a gas station-cum-fort near Lady Belmont's hardhold. Nevermind that last week he smeared lady Belmont's son all over the snow; he didn't know who he was at the time, and she doesn't know he did it (and it was one Nero the Operator's gigs, anyway).<br/><br/>There's one of her knights there, though, head-to-toe riot armor and an auto-shotgun. His friend at the gas station explains that Dipshit (that's his name) is taking down names: anyone who gets gas has to swear fealty to Lady Belmont. Fealty? Like, you give her some jingle and fight for her and she's got your back. Lobster's having none of it. He has Sunny, a big guy with a big grin, rustle a stun gun out of his machine and sneak up behind Dipshit while Lobster distracts him. <br/><br/>Act Under Fire: Blown. Sunny's stun gun fails to go off, and when he checks it he tazes himself. Dipshit spins in surprise, firing; Sunny's hit twice before Lobster's machete takes him in the neck, between the armor plates. He's meat, Sunny's in a bad way; the closest medico is at Lady Belmont's.

The henge helped a girl find her little brother, who had wandered off to hang out with the local ocean goddess, Lady Nishiki. It took a bit of flailing around for them to reach the goddess' undersea palace, but it wasn't too hard for the henge to persuade the boy to come back home, with the promise that he could come back later so the goddess could play more Pokemon. The fish henge need some fine-tuning, but they seem to work really well overall. I did purposely make an aquatic adventure to make his life easier, but then it's meant to be kind of an advanced character type for players to use more sparingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385598/#Comment_385598" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T16:55:29+00:00" title="July 22, 2012  4:55PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We just wrapped a playtest session of my Apocalypse World secret police hack and it went really well.</blockquote>\nReally wild game. Double-crosses, distrust and animosity between the characters, black-bag operations, reputations and lives ruined.<br/><br/>I could really see this game being used to run a session set in the world of James Ellroy's <i>American Underworld Trilogy</i> -- FBI agents, cops, CIA operatives, all working together against a mutual foe, but keeping an eye on each other just the same. Because one of them might be a <b>Red</b>.<br/><br/>Or perhaps a game of <i>Fringe</i> -- you've got an agent from our world, an agent from their world, and a member of another agency that gets sucked into the investigation, unaware of the bizarre circumstances. Same principles: some can be trusted, some can't; some will investigate each other, and some will try to solve the case; some will live, and some will die very badly.<br/><br/>Top-notch gaming session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385625/#Comment_385625" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-23T11:15:14+00:00" title="July 23, 2012 11:15AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hot Guys Making Out   (in which they totally didn't)\n<blockquote>It is Spain, 1936.  Gonsalvo (16) is in the town market doing some shopping with the maid Maria, and Honor\xe9 has dressed Gonsalvo in a boy's uniform which was perhaps appropriate at the turn of the century.  Gonsalvo misunderstands when the other boys point and laugh.  He blushes and buries himself into Maria.

Honor\xe9 cannot speak of his feelings, but chastises the other youths.  He asks the young Gonsalvo if he still feels the same embarassment.<br/><br/>Gonsalvo, in a moment of rare and decisive action, declares that he wants to lunch right here in the square, and they can think whatever they will.</blockquote>\nI love the way the cards totally drove the scenes in this game.

We hear stories about a bug-bear and other 20 people who have dissapeard in the same way, leaving only some blood on the places where they dissapeared. The only victim found is a brutally murder child, his body destroyed beyond the resurrection and restoring abilities of the local priestess of the Inmaculada.<br/><br/>We keep asking questions, find the local magic item vendor is up to something, though an undercover paladin on the town can't find any proof. After unsuccesfully trying to find anything on him, we leave for the caves where the townsmen slained the bugbear a month and a half ago, two weeks after the dissapearings started. We find the necklace of the girl, the now empty tomb of the bugbear... and I find an old friend from the temple where my monk trained, now turned into a Lord Wight, along with the 20 dissapeared townsmen and the girl, turned into wights themselves.<br/><br/>Barely managed to destroy them all, thanks to our halfling rogue and his opportune bolt of undead slaying, critically shot to the head of the lord wight, as our cleric consecrated the place to prevent more unwanted resurrections. Turns out once turned into zombies, these people couldn't get a true resurrection performed on them, so we buried them. Gave the necklace and the condolences to her father and boyfrined, as well as setting him free. And we gave a final visit to the vendor.<br/><br/>We find the morningstar used by the bugbear on his house and interrogate him with no results... except for that smile we can't take out of his face: he knows we have nothing on him. So I leave him unconscious and plant the hand wrappings of the undead monk on him, and tip the paladin on that. We leave the town, finding out the paladin is now in prision for killing the vendor (these people don't believe the "detect evil" ability of the paladin is proof of anything) and swear to come back and free him once our other quest is done...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386102/#Comment_386102" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T19:03:23+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  7:03PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Squeaking in at the end of July!<br/><br/>We just had the best game of Archipelago, kicking off what looks to be a three-session game. So much fun! The premise that developed was that we were all part of a mud show, a traveling carnival playing to river gilly's up and down the Mississippi valley in the late forties. Our show is so small everybody does two jobs. My guy is the advance man and magician. We have a strong man who takes care of our gorilla (Daisy) and lion (King). There's a clown who runs a ten-in-one and the owner of the Calhoun Family Wonder Show, and ringmaster, who happens to also be a dwarf. Finally there's the obligatory 16 year old runaway.<br/><br/>The coolest thread among many was establishing that our clowns are a really rough crowd of hard living guys, who save the kid from something perhaps worse than a beating in Cape Girardeau and win his teenaged awe. He wants to be a clown, he wants to be a badass, and they are OK with that. My guy, the advance man, something of an alcoholic dandy, is not. He pulls Clive the head clown aside and tells him to let the kid grow up first.<br/><br/>We didn't know where the scene would go. I'm making a demand, and "that won't be so easy!" somebody shouts. A card is drawn - I won't get what I want, but I'll learn something useful in the process. Greg, playing Clive, tells me the clowns like the kid and won't tell him what to do, that they love to have fun and their fun is a little rough but they are good guys. And what is unspoken but understood is that they are all veterans, they were all on Saipan and at Normandy just a few years earlier and clowning is how they are approaching normality again from a safe distance. It was a cool scene and a really important revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
