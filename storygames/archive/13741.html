I've played lots of games, thousands, and nothing is as droll as players not accepting the premise for the game, playing it as if it was some kind of abstract procedure. It is not enough to make the moves; you have to make them with intent and engagement. That's <i>immersion</i>, wether you play a board game, a computer game or a role-playing game.<br/><br/>Included in immersion in role-playing games is the feeling for your character. One strong premise of the role-playing is indeed that; <i>the role-playing</i>. You need to have some vestige of identification with your character, and some interest in making his/her moves in a way that brings intent and engagement to it. <br/><br/>Not all immersion is as BIG as David makes it sound like in his flamboyant post; it certainly is not. But you need some of it; a player need to accept the premise of the game to really play it. Game-play devoid of contact with the premise is, in fact, a player not participating in the game. One player refusing to immerse can ruin the whole game-play. Players stating: "Oh, I don't care who wins" - in a board-game, is really the ones not immersed, and by saying such things they undermines the game for all. Players stating: "It's the same to me what my character do. What do you want him to do?" - in a role-playing game, is doing the same thing; undermining the game-play. I pity people like that. It is indeed a small investment to make; accepting the premise of a game you have accepted to play. So; a small immersion is always needed.<br/><br/>But then; when you have seen the depths of really BIG immersion, as described by David above, you are seldom satisfied with anything less evocative, engulfing and easy-flowing. <br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311010/#Comment_311010" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-03T23:06:47+00:00" title="February  3, 2011 11:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, I'm pretty sure we're just using different language.

Can you expand on why you think immersion helps with more than just these and why being engaged in the game doesnt offer the same benefit?  To me being engaged with the character implies at least a bit of immersion and I usually dont find any benefit in going beyond that stage, certainly not to the point where I get interested in say what my character is feeling as they walk through a market place or have philosophical discussions that relate to little else going on in the game world.  These are things that I've heard proponents of immersion state as positive experiences on occasion so if they dont match with your experience then it may not pertain to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311120/#Comment_311120" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T11:13:47+00:00" title="February  4, 2011 11:13AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of my list wasn't stuff that you completely can't do without immersion -- it's just stuff where immersion cranks the volume up from 3 to 10.<br><br>As for philosophizing in the marketplace, yeah, when immersed, I'm often into that.

And those things are valued in different amounts by different folks.<br><br>I am working on an article about player motives, which are both the disires that lead to a specific behavior, and the urge to have certain types of experiences at some point during a game event.<br><br>This list was developed through the lens of live combat larping, so there are areas picked out that have minimal play in tabletop (like Exercise and Crafting, though Crafting is possible). And there may be some areas that need a bit more fleshing out (splitting terms, possibly) to relate to tabletop play.<br/><br/>But here's the list currently:<br/>1. Audience - Experience a satisfying narrative.<br/>2. Catharsis - Experience emotions through the character.<br/>3. Comprehension - Figure things out. Solve problems and puzzles.<br/>4. Competition - Win at something, or at least enjoy the act of competing.<br/>5. Crafting - Create non-ephemeral things.<br/>6. Education \u2013 Take away new knowledge or understanding as a player.<br/>7. Embodiment \u2013Make decisions based on character background, knowledge, and motivation.<br/>8. Exercise - Enjoy physical activity.<br/>9. Exploration - Experience the fictional setting.<br/>10. Exhibition - Show off (costumes, props, acting chops, mad skillz, etc.) and get kudos.<br/>11. Fellowship - Enjoy time with friends (also includes flirting and such).<br/>12. Flow \u2013 Enjoy losing oneself in the moment.<br/>13. Leadership - Be important to the player community.<br/>14. Protagonist - Be important to the story.<br/>15. Spectacle - Experience the awesome stuff.<br/>16. Versatility - Have the right thing at the right time. <br/><br/>This list is just a beginning section of a 30 page article that will be published this summer, if not sooner. But I think it gives a more granular way to look at things.<br/><br/>Immersion consists of a collection of things. Usually it's some combination of Embodiment, Catharsis, and Flow. <br/><br/>The Exploration motive centers around what, in some of those other threads, is called "setting immersion", and may or may not be experienced in conjunction with the others.<br/><br/>The Flow motive is basically what you are calling engagement. And as you saw, when Flow is combined with other motives, some people call that immersion too. That's part of the problem I have with the term.<br/><br/>Exactly what combination a person calls immersion depends on the person and, for immersionist proponents, usually corresponds with "good".<br/><br/>I think that, more than anything, what you are excited about is flow - that transcendent state of heightened awareness, success, reduced sense of self. I think that is your main focus of motivation. Having reached that, all the other elements have a heightened impact.<br/><br/>And I think that's true. From a state of flow, everything is better. But that doesn't mean everything comes from flow. Your list contains a whole bunch of other motives, which a given player, even one who enjoys Embodiment and Catharsis and Flow (ie. immersion) may or may not value.<br/><br/>Your list with comments:<br/>So, taking engagement as a prerequisite, what is immersion good for on top of that?<br/><br/>It's good for giving importance to discoveries and learning.<br/>--Exploration/Education<br/>It's good for adding adrenaline to chases and physical struggles.<br/>--This would be Exercise if it were larp. In TT, it falls under Catharsis.<br/>It's good for sensory detail that you otherwise might not bother sharing or processing.<br/>--Exploration<br/>It's good for cultivating a flow state where you can play for long periods without conscious effort.<br/>--Flow, of course<br/>It's good for remembering later -- killing an orc yourself sticks in the mind better than using some avatar to kill an orc.<br/>--This, I'm less sure about. In fact, it starts to scare me a bit. I think this may be an area where distancing yourself from deep immersion may be better than embracing it.<br/>It's good for group unity, the same way a camping trip is.<br/>--Fellowship<br/>It's good for rewarding big choices about life rather than little choices about a game.<br/>--Making choices feel big and important would come under Audience - significance is what differentiates "story stuff" from "everyday stuff".

I've embarked on a design-endeavor that is singularly aimed at creating deeply immersive play. I have had different levels of success with three games of this kind, one of them really delivering the players into an experience unlike anything we've seen in other rpgs. <br/><br/>To make the games work this way, I have use old and invented new storytelling- and dialogue-techniques, and have made them the driving force in the methods. There is next to none mechanics in these games, and I believe that is an important fact. <br/><br/>Focusing my methods on techniques have made my "immersive games" end up far from the way modern american games are designed and played, and as far from classical games like D&amp;D and Warhammer.<br/><br/>And then; nowadays I'm testing out my new method for the old classical game Fabula, and have seen that it too seem to support a high degree of immersion. That has led me to plan a test-campaign with little action, and much focus on character and relationships, to test how well this classical method hold up to game-play aimed at deep immersion. If it do, I expect us to have a series of increasingly strong game-sessions, nothing much happening, other than us living the ordinary lives of the characters, and being completely overwhelmed by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the force of the fiction</span> we create. <br/><br/>This does not sound very exciting to the majority of role-players out there, I know that ...<br/>- but it is indeed exciting to a designer like me ...<br/>- and it is indeed a kind of play that transport me, and players in my games, like no other game-play, to a place of magic.<br/><br/>To conclude, Ralph; the reason role-playing games are only partially suited to doing the immersive thing, may be due to them being <i>partially flawed</i> designs. Or; role-playing games have not evolved enough to do this very effectively. We must expect games of the future to be much more efficient at dragging us (shouting and screaming, begging for mercy) into immersion. I do hope so!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311171/#Comment_311171" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-04T16:21:44+00:00" title="February  4, 2011  4:21PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2011 4:30PM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Immersion is an end in itself.

It's neat that some folks here have taken it to another level.<br/><br/>As for "why use RPGs to do this?" my answer is that it's a virtual experience substitute for real experiences that I'd like to have but can't.  My real life could stand some more adventure and excitement, but I'm not willing to risk death and/or spend thousands of dollars for that privilege.  So, I simulate adventurous situations, temporarily sell myself on the risk, get the rush, and then pop out of it later unscathed.<br/><br/>For some reason I have an easier time simulating this via my imagination than my eyes; video games and movies don't have the same effect.

That is; as long as it's done in a reasonably safe and comfortable manner, of course. Role-playing games are ideal in this regard, as you have already remarked. I believe any rpg-adventure is better off with players having a feel for their characters, identifying with them in complex ways. That is the hallmark for immersive game-play. So there is no reason to let go of immersion in high drama and adventure, in my view.<br/><br/>I have had success doing immersion in my classical fantasy role-playing game Fabula. It has served me for 16 years now, approximately 2500-3000 game-sessions. During that time I have made several methodic experiments, most of them aimed at strengthening immersion. It has been done by compiling simple tricks of the trade in most of these experiments, and in some I have invented techniques of more complex nature. Most of the tools I've used in this respect has been aimed at the players, forcing them to step into the shoes of their characters, by playing on instinctive reactions and quite normal emotional responses.<br/><br/>Most players are very positive and open in respect to what a game may do for them, and that is a prerequisite, of course, for succeeding with such experiments. Having players following up on the lead of a game-method or a GM, and digging in deep, has been a very rewarding experience through the years. I highly recommend climbing out on a shaky limb when designing your games ...<br/>- and when leading a game-session ...<br/>- and absolutely when playing a character!<br/>Trust and curiosity is good!<br/><br/>As for the "immersive games" of mine ...<br/>- they are all contemporary in setting, dealing with the lives of "ordinary" people (nothing ordinary about the game-play, mind you). I am sorry to say that none of them are translated to English. They have not been published in Norwegian either, being part of a larger design-project I have worked on and off with the last 5 years, planned to be comprised of 9 games on lives of "ordinary" people.<br/><br/>However; I have had requests through the years for translations of my games, and so I have begun pondering doing that soon; compiling an anthology of my English games, with some translated games included (for good measure). So; there is hope, but you'll have to wait ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311266/#Comment_311266" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T14:32:00+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  2:32PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I have had success doing immersion in my classical fantasy role-playing game Fabula.

I want to hear more about this!<br/><br/>A few years ago, I tried to stick in a mechanic to reward immersion-conducive play in Delve.  I instructed the players, "When someone narrates something vivid that makes you feel like you were 'really there', award them a chip."  The chips were then spent on character advancement.  This failed utterly, as the attention to chips and awards broke immersion.<br/><br/>I changed it to, at the end of each session, "Remember cool moments that made you feel like you were 'really there', and award a chip to the player responsible for each moment."  But then we had trouble identifying those moments -- it was much easier to rate the fiction for things like "this was cool!" or "that was exciting!" as opposed to "I was particularly immersed then!"  There's a heavy overlap between "when are you most engaged" and "when are you most immersed", but the two aren't identical.<br/><br/>Currently, the game's pitch contains a "try to immerse" mandate, the mechanics all spring from the fiction, the GM's given help to create engaging situations, and contact with metagame elements has been minimized.

It was back when Forge-speak were evolving. I tried to argue the point that these phrases makes some kind of mind-frame from which designers are hard pressed to break out of. I did not succeed.<br/><br/>I believe my point is valid though. Is is hard to think outside the "box" provided by the language we use. When no suitable terms exist, we have problems thinking in those terms.<br/><br/>In this regard it is a case of the term "mechanics" dominating the field of thinking, closing it to thoughts on storyteller- and dialogue-techniques, and experiments with tools in that part of the game-method. There seem to be a lack of understanding amongst English-talking designers for the importance of working with techniques in a conscious way, making premeditated tools for the players to use. You have a tendency, like you here David, to work within mechanical parameters.<br/><br/>What I find most conductive to immersion in role-playing games, is having the players talk as, act as, and feel as their characters. I need the player to adopt the frame of mind of his character, and his point of view. To make this happen, I need to work the player. That is; to regard him as a human being, with instincts and emotions like any other human, and apply my knowledge of humans in my dealings with him, either as a designer or as a game-master. I need to organize my knowledge of humans, make it into viable dialogue tools, and make them available to the players. And, as the players are blank on this when they come to my game, I need to tell them carefully what to do, and make sure my tools works when they do it. So my tools have to be well conceived, effective, and simple.<br/><br/>One such simple tool:<br/>When the characters enter a crisis in the fiction; <b>talk loud and fast!</b> <br/><br/>Explanation:<br/>- Loud noises influence the human body; we go into danger-mode, the body producing hormones that sharpen our senses and shorten our response time. This physical response is very conductive to our game-play in a crisis. <br/>- Fast talking influence us, and makes us produce stress hormones, which also is very conductive to our game-play in a crisis.<br/><br/>Background:<br/>- Emotions originates in our bodies. We have a whole system of glands producing hormones. These are keyed to certain situations and sensory stimulations.<br/>- If the whole group (or a leader) follows up on a behavior, and the behavior is keyed to a specific situation, the group is likely to produce emotions that mirror the real emotions of said situation. This is equally true for fear, anger, sorrow, love and happiness, all the main emotions.<br/>- When you instruct the players to use certain behaviors in their game, the players themselves start producing some emotions that suits the situation, and thus they strengthen their identification with the characters, triggering a deeper immersion. You get more realistic characterization, more complex interaction, far more intensity, and a lot of serious fun!<br/><br/><b>It's simple; go outside the box of "system" and "mechanics". Start thinking <i>dialogue-techniques</i> as an important field of design in your games. </b><br/><br/>BTW:<br/>To design "dialogue-based role-playing games", while ignoring the dialogue ...<br/>- that has never sounded smart to me.<br/>;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311292/#Comment_311292" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T19:34:53+00:00" title="February  5, 2011  7:34PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Interesting thread, and, as always, I have a few questions which may be interested to you and me, and maybe not anyone reading. We'll see!<br/><br/>1. I'll be curious to hear what you think about Tomas's example technique in the post above this one. Does that match your idea of desirable immersion or not? I sometimes get the sense that your "immersion" is less about "experiencing the sensations/emotions of the character" and more about "all pretending together, really hard, that what we're imagining is REAL." Those two overlap in lots of ways, but not 100%.<br/><br/>2. These guys here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>It's good for<i>group unity</i>, the same way a camping trip is.<br/><br/>It's good for<i>rewarding big choices</i>about life rather than little choices about a game.<br/><br/>It's good for<i>etching your contributions into the permanent record</i>of a world that will outlast this moment.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure I understand what they have to do with "immersion". In the case of the first ("group unity"), I've seen a lot of people say that "immersion" can actually distance people from each other, such as when each person is experiencing their viewpoint of the fiction so strongly that they pay less attention to the real world (i.e. the other players). (Ask me if you don't know what I mean here.)<br/><br/>In the case of the second, I'm just not sure what you mean. It sounds cool; can you expand on it?<br/><br/>In the third, what does it have to do with "immersion"? How does "immersion" help us etch a permanent contribution, more so than, say, writing a book or designing a webpage or building a house together?<br/><br/>Finally, my most serious question:<br/><br/>3. To you, is "immersion" a goal, like what Tomas and Graham are describing, above? A end to seek for enjoyment? Or is "immersion" a technique, a style of play, that helps us get to the real goal of play (e.g. discovering cool magical secrets through player cleverness)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311317/#Comment_311317" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T00:28:41+00:00" title="February  6, 2011 12:28AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I've seen a lot of people say that "immersion" can actually distance people from each other, such as when each person is experiencing their viewpoint of the fiction so strongly that they pay less attention to the real world (i.e. the other players).</blockquote>I believe this is true for broken game-play. An immersive player may very well become a lonely bird on the sky, estranging himself from the group, if said group is on a totally different tack than him. It is possible to choose immersion as an introvert stance.<br/><br/>This is, however, something I have never experienced in really immersive games. When the whole group work towards immersion, there is too much feed going into the immersion of each and every player, for any of them to ignore it. Interaction supporting immersion becomes an imperative in such groups, a joint venture.<br/><br/>The point is to get the interaction geared towards immersion as a shared state of mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311330/#Comment_311330" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T08:32:54+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  8:32AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2011 8:37AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>Great stuff!

Please share more!<br/><br/>Here's one I've found to be key for certain players: as GM, don't let the players <i>see</i> you making stuff up on the spot.

I don't share that assumption, though.  It's like asking if I "really" like chocolate cake because it's chocolate or because it's cake.  My answer is that I like some non-chocolate cakes, and I like some non-cake chocolates, but there's nothing that's satisfying in quite the same way as a chocolate cake.<br/><br/>Camping trip: have you ever been on one?  Now imagine simulating that very intensely in an RPG.  Real-life inter-reliance is reproduced via character inter-reliance.  I'm not talking about creative unity, I'm talking about survival unity.  The whole "go to war together" vibe pro athletes talk about.<br/><br/>Separately, amen to what Tomas just said on isolation.<br/><br/>Big choices: if you feel like <i>you're</i> there facing death, your choices about that feel BIG, as opposed to your <i>pawn</i> facing death, where your choices feel SMALL, like in chess.  Unless you pay chess for thousands of dollars or at gunpoint, there's a big difference.<br/><br/>Permanence: treating an imagined world as real enables a unique relationship to that world's record.  It's the difference between story and history.<br/><br/>Again, remember that, in all this, I'm just claiming that immersion is the hand turning up the volume knob, not some sort of definitional requirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311334/#Comment_311334" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-06T09:13:34+00:00" title="February  6, 2011  9:13AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I gotcha:<br/><br/>What you're describing as immersion is an emotional intensifier.

(when they want to roll the die), being "unfair" (life's not fair, and that triggers anger).<br/><br/>Sorrow: low voice, hanging head, hands touching, sighs, tears, reaching out to other players, hand over hearth while saying the name of a dead character, doing new tasks while pondering loss and meaninglessness, quiet reminiscence, sudden flashbacks.<br/><br/>Love: talking softly, laughing, touching, caressing the hand of a player while talking to him as his lover, laying your arm over someones shoulder, smiling intently.<br/><br/>Joy: laughter, talking fast and with short breaths, including other with words and gestures, enthusiastically enforcing the words of others, saying "Yes! Yes! Yes!", doing silly things/plays/pranks (a sign of surplus energy).<br/><br/><b>In addition:</b> do some of the things you usually do when in a state, and it will go a long way to induce that state in you and others. And that "what you usually do" thing is important; use your instincts! Remove yourself from consciously thinking on these things when playing. It should be used there and then, in the spur of the moment, to be most effective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311396/#Comment_311396" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T02:45:46+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  2:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 2:46AM by Graham.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>Have you watched people when they're angry?

I've never thought directly about "what emotion do I want to evoke here?" when GMing immersive games.  Usually I think one step removed from that -- "how do I want the environment/NPC to appear?"  If I do it right, the players tend to have <i>some</i> emotional reaction...<br/><br/>There are definitely times when I want the players to experience a sense of revelation, in either a "Yes!  I figured out how to defeat the monster!" way or an "Oh god, that means the babies are all going to be massacred!" way.  The after-emotion would be pride* or dread/panic, but I have trouble naming the emotion at the moment of revelation.<br/><br/>There are also times when I want the players to be creeped out.  I guess that's mostly anxiety, with a side of fear and disgust.  I think the techniques you listed under <b>fear</b> might work for this.  I already do the intense staring at times, and well as occasional silence.  Maybe I'll try out the tapping, sudden movements, and monotone.  The monotone is at odds, though, with my general effort to raise the group's engagement and energy level (we tend to play at night when some folks are tired and distractable).<br/><br/>For the sake of letting the players immerse in a setting that feels authentic to them, I've tended to present things impartially, using my NPCs' speech for all my emoting.  So describing a character's grave with my head hanging, as GM, would be new to me.  I'm a bit worried that my players would feel confused or manipulated or think I was ill, but I should try it and find out.<br/><br/>Do you ever alert your players (especially new ones) beforehand that your narrative techniques are meant to facilitate immersion, rather than convey info, mandate responses, etc.?<br/><br/>*Pride: lean back, narrowed eyes, smirking smile, head nodding.  I call this the "awww yeeeah" pose, and it says, "Time to gloat, boys."  Would you use this?  Or is it too fraternal, as opposed to the usual GM role as other?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311551/#Comment_311551" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T15:46:55+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  3:46PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David!<br/><br/>No, I never alert my players to anything, except at cons; where I say beforehand if my games are for grown ups (which they most usually are, at cons).<br/><br/>As for your players feeling confused; try not to overdo it. Indicate the stance, by bending your head a bit, looking up at times, saggin your body to underline it, but keeping up communication. There is no sense in isolating yourself from communicating with the players, as a GM, and eye-contact is essential in communication.<br/><br/>Same for use of monotone voice; try to work it the right way. Do it as a way of <i>intensifying</i> communication. If you do it right, the player(s) you address should be dragged in by your narration, getting the monotone chills as an extra.<br/><br/>As for playing at night, when people are tired; I do very little of that. I like to play in the daytime, and do most sessions then. When doing evening-sessions, I like to start with dinner, and to have a bowl of fruits on the table. Most players are nostalgic towards eating chips and drinking soda at the game-table, but still; every one player I know have a much better game starting on solid food, and fruits to keep them energized throughout the session, into late night hours. <br/><br/>I'm a weird one, I know, meddling in the nutrition of my players.

When being the GM; keep your eye on the target, be direct and simple in approach, and go with the flow. And be sure you have a game with mechanics that allows you to be simple. There's little flow to be found in systems that makes you haul half a ton of dice each evening.
