Do feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on that.<br/><br/>This wasn't made for the <a href="https://200wordrpg.github.io/" rel="nofollow">200 Word RPG Challenge</a>, although it was inspired by it. Not sure what I'll do with it (if anything), but I'd welcome any feedback, reactions, brickbats, anything else. <br/><br/>I've tested the card mechanic just a bit and it seems to be not broken, but I'd be interested in anyone else's perspective. Not sure "family" is the right container / theme either, but seems to work so far.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks!<br/>----------<br/>Standard 54-card deck. Red is loving. Black is dark.<br/> <br/>Shuffle face cards into their own deck -- the characters. (Other cards are events.) Turn two cards up: First, the head of the family. Second, their child.<br/> <br/>Deal each player three event cards.<br/> <br/>Tell the story of the family -- an oil dynasty, a fantasy kingdom, your suburban neighbors, whatever -- as follows:<br/> <br/>On your turn, play a card from your hand to a family member, as long as it's at least as high as the highest event card already present there. If red, describe a loving event involving that character and another. If black, a dark one. Say why. Higher numbers means higher stakes.<br/> <br/>Play an Ace to kill any character.<br/> <br/>Play a Joker to discard all event cards from any character. Shuffle the Joker back in. Play again.<br/> <br/>If you can't play, expose a new character, if any remain. Narrate their connection (dark or loving) to the family, then draw three cards.<br/> <br/>For events, a change of color may be an upheaval. A change of suit in the same color may be a change in direction.<br/> <br/>Play until events run out. Did dark characters meet dark ends? Did loving characters remain so?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463679/#Comment_463679" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-03T11:26:48+00:00" title="June  3, 2017 11:26AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463680/#Comment_463680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-03T14:32:54+00:00" title="June  3, 2017  2:32PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2017 2:34PM by hamnacb.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all I loved this game when I've read it.<br/><br/>I'm very bad at remembering the name of suits so I usually got puzzled when a game uses them for different game aspects. L&amp;D mainly use the colors, so i've found this very player friendly.<br/><br/>We've tried the game out and it rocked.<br/><br/>The picture of the face cards can give some inspiration for the character, which is good, because 'improvise something!' is usually a hard task.<br/><br/>Also I think the mechanics are very suitable for hacking.<br/><br/>We had a few questions though:<br/>1. When you expose a new character, their connection is based on the color of it's card or shall the player immediately put an event card next to it to do that? Is exposing a 'full action' in your turn? <br/>2. Can you introduce 'NPCs' without exposing a face card?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463683/#Comment_463683" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-03T21:27:56+00:00" title="June  3, 2017  9:27PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2017 9:36PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like it has a lot of potential and that you might be able to get a lot out of a little.

Really interested to see any hacks.<br/><br/>The mechanics are ones that have been kicking around in my head for some time and have made it into a couple of draft designs. The nice thing about doing something in 200 words is that it becomes a "finished" design very quickly and is easy to get out there. This may well become something more elaborate at some point, who knows...<br/><br/>hamnacb, that's great to hear that you had a good time with it. Because the rules have to fit in 200 words there's obviously going to be some corner-cutting. My general assumption is that you don't do anything the rules don't say, so in exposing a new character you'd narrate their connection, draw three cards, but then *not* play one of those three. The connection could be based on the new character's color (that's how I've been rolling), but the rules don't explicitly say that.<br/><br/>As to your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, I don't think you could intro a new character without exposing a face card. Another thing the rules don't explicitly say is that the new cards don't have to be members of the family, they just have to be connected to a character already in play.<br/><br/>Jeff_B_Slater, really interested to hear any questions or see any hacks you come up with. Thanks for looking in!<br/><br/>One thing I'm interested to explore is whether "family" is the right theme for this. Not sure yet, but I haven't really done a deep dive on it. In a more fully fleshed-out design (i.e., one that doesn't have to fit into 200 words) a lot more might be possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463688/#Comment_463688" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T07:46:48+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  7:46AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on the 200-word limit is: it was useful to you, in that you have a prototype ready to play. Now, take it for a spin - play - and then, when you get back to working on the text, don't feel like you have to honor a word-count limit anymore.
