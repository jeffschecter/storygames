                    So, I gather some of you are studying improv at the moment. Could you tell me a bit about what you're learning and which bits are relevant to game design?<br/>
<br/>
I did a lot of Keith Johnstone-style improvisation a few years ago. I'll post about that when I've got more time, but I wanted to find out from others what their experience was.<br/>

                            Hi Graham!<br/><br/>Me and two other guys who can out themselves if they want are taking a six-week class through <a href="http://www.dsicomedytheater.com/" rel="nofollow">DSI</a>, a total of 18 hours of instruction followed by a performance.  Our first class was last Saturday and it blew my mind - there was a ton of content that seemed really relevant to roleplaying.  <br/><br/>The whole idea of "yes, and..." agreement rather than building toward conflicts is excruciatingly interesting to me.  <br/><br/>The whole idea of being engaged 100% as part of a collaborative team, and building off the cues of others, maintaining focus in physical and generally nonverbal ways, is very exciting and underutilized in gaming.  <br/><br/>Seriously, we were all making these sidelong glances and smirking about every fifteen minutes as something new came up that we could directly apply.  And that was just week one.  I'm pretty stoked.                        </div>

<p>The things that struck me at the time, and have continued to:</p>
<p>a) "Yes, and..." Man, I was blown away by this concept - that by doing improv together, we agree to accept each other's creative input and work from it. In role-playing games, there's often an elaborate system to vet input - either a GM/player control structure, a mechanical method (a la Donjon), or even a simple "bullshit rule." All of these, though, are meant to eliminate "bad creative input." We have mechanics of denial. In improv, we were taught this is not the way. We've agreed - we've got a social contract - to have a good time working off each other's stuff. We don't need denial mechanics. This is cool!</p>
<p>b) "Agreement is more fun to watch than conflict." I don't agree necessarily with this statement. But it was said by people obviously better at making up stuff than me. What I did agree with was a later clarification: when people don't completely trust each other in the making-stuff-up process yet, agreement works! Conflict is too easily conflated with real personal conflict, and should be avoided until there's enough trust to have it.</p>
<p>Both of these are heavily influencing my current design.</p>

<p><code>In role-playing games, there's often an elaborate system to vet input</code></p>
<p>Although there are also games (even intensely competitive games) that operate entirely on accepting unvetted input and doing the "Yes, and ..." thing.  So it's not unknown to the art-form.</p>
<p>As for (b), I think that while the people you were learning with know more about creatively agreeing, you may well know more than they do about <em>fruitful</em> conflict.  I've met many people (both in roleplaying and outside of it) that think of "conflict" as "unending, unresolvable conflict that just keeps circling and circling and circling" and yeah that is <em>dead boring</em>.  If that's the only sort of creative conflict they've been exposed to then their point of view will be skewed by that.</p>

Conflict's important but there's a lot about rp that doesn't need it--all the stuff that the gm used to do before the players got there we get to do at the table, all together. <br/><br/>So there was agreement about what was added to the play, but was there conflict in the content of what happened?                        </div>

                            I'm the last guy in the class. One thing that I thought was neat were all the formal prep excercises before they had us get up on stage. Each one had a different task, be it keeping eye contact and concentration, committing to a line or train of thought, or just getting to know the other folks around you. <br/>
<br/>
These excercises were fun in their own right, but had very little to do, directly, with performance/improv. It was like doing single-muscle excercises, and it was excellent. I haven't checked out the Forge thread on 'Roleplaying Excercises', but now I will, because I'm darn curious.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the 'agreement is more interesting to watch than conflict' is geared towards performance, and I'm interested to see if there are exceptions (which were hinted at during the class).                        </div>

                            Here's a data point - Clinton and I had to work prett y hard <em>not</em> to introduce conflict, because, well, <em>that's what you do</em>.  And I don't think improv people think conflict is bad, per se, but rather that it is a tool in the box that can be used or not.  Instead of <em>being</em> the box.  <br/><br/>And ECB, there is surely a lot of spillover between larp, freeform, jeepform stuff and improv.  I don't know if others have blazed this trail, or if theory analogs exist.  I was really amazed to learn about the depth and rigor of theory in improv.  These people take it very seriously and have a deep grounding in the discipline.  We are going to hoover that mess up, rest assured.                        </div>

                            Clinton, I find your two observations interesting. I actually think role-playing's ability to raise conflicts is a plus. I think the "yes and.." tehnique is largely an evolution from the fact that improv theater is usually performed in front of an audience. Obviously, that puts certain constraints on the performance. Role-playing does not have those constraints, so it's free to explore other routes for generating fiction, thus conflict resolution. That's something I like about role-playing. But that's probably a good discussion for another thread.                        </div>

                            Bloody hell, no offence, but that link has the dullest version of "Yes, and" I've ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
The idea behind "Yes, And..." is that you accept what the other person's said and build on it. Often, there's an instinct to say no:<br/>
<br/>
"I smash you to the ground!"<br/>
"No you don't! I dodge the blow!"<br/>
<br/>
So the idea with "Yes, And..." is that it's more interesting if you say yes:<br/>
<br/>
"I smash you to the ground!"<br/>
"Yes, and you put me in a coma!"<br/>
<br/>
This could be great for roleplayers for building setting...<br/>
<br/>
"Let's play a game in a huge city."<br/>
"Yes, and let's have in the future."<br/>
"Yes, and let's make it a dystopian future, with everyone observed by cameras."<br/>
<br/>
Or just for playing:<br/>
<br/>
"I try to appeal to the dragon's mercenary side."<br/>
"Yes, and we explain that, if he leaves the town alone, they'll bring gold as a tribute."<br/>
"Yes, and they'll leave human sacrifices to the dragon."<br/>
"Yes, and they'll be the first born of every family."<br/>
<br/>
It's used in lots of roleplaying games already, of course, in different forms. But it's interesting stuff.<br/>
<br/>

Andy, you asked for links. The best one I can find is the Wikipedia entry on improv:<br/>
<br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre<br/>
<br/>
and a few paragraphs down there's a decent explanation of "Yes, and...".<br/>

<i>b) "Agreement is more fun to watch than conflict." I don't agree necessarily with this statement. But it was said by people obviously better at making up stuff than me. What I did agree with was a later clarification: when people don't completely trust each other in the making-stuff-up process yet, agreement works! Conflict is too easily conflated with real personal conflict, and should be avoided until there's enough trust to have it.</i><br/><br/>It looks to me like this kind of shows the difference between the players and the characters.

                            Maybe one reason they avoid conflict is because they don't have that denial mechanism Clinton mentions. Without this, there's nothing to end a conflict short of creative agreement. Whereas games have this, and so can encourage conflict... but maybe at the price of hindering creative agreement?                        </div>

                            I think the idea is that conflict <i>all the time</i> is dull to watch. Lots of improvisers rush on to stage and, in an effort to make something interesting happen, start an argument. But it's just shouty and dull.

                            When you have conflict between the characters and don't have conflict between the players - it's more something like 'yes, and' improvisation, less like a game, I think. These two produce really different kind of fun, don't they?<br/>

Of course, It doesn't mean that improv stuff has no use in game design.                        </div>

                            Not necessarily. Yes and caries with it a certain amount of challenge and one-upmanship as you try to build off of what the other guy is saying, yet toping it in a way. Sort of like Baron Munchausen except instead of the players bidding coins back and forth trying to block what the other wants to insert, they build off each other and thus carries things into interesting directions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is from here: http://www.humanpingpongball.com/improv_glossary.html<br/>
<br/>
[i]Blocking<br/>
Not Accepting other players' offers, and actually destroying these offers. Not the same as Ignoring .<br/>
<br/>
Not a good thing. <br/>
<br/>
Canceling<br/>
Canceling is destroying what has been established. Better is to use all elements that have been introduced - see Reincorporating .<br/>
<br/>
Denial<br/>
We have Denial when players are not Accepting each other's Offer 's. Obviously not a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring<br/>
Ignoring others' offers. Not a nice thing to do. Note that this is even worse than Blocking .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wimping<br/>
Wimping is accepting offers but refusing to do anything with them.<br/>
<br/>
Examples are<br/>
<br/>
    * asking open Questions , thus leaving the action to be decided by the other player<br/>
    * Waffling , babbling without accomplishing any action. [/i]                        </div>

                            I'm surprised no one has brought up Keith Johnstone yet. His books on Impro are quite fascinating, and I think someone on the 20by20room wrote an entry about them a while ago.<br/>
<br/>
I read Impro for Storytellers. Actually, the whole book reads as if he improvised it. That's neat, in a way--you get a technique, then a story, then it reminds him of a game so he throws that in, back to an anecdote, then some advice...<br/>
<br/>
Overall, "Yes and" is, like timfire says, based on having an audience. The show must go on; don't argue about input, push it further. Notice that most Impro is comical, too, so it's fine to just go overboard.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he says he has actors redo a whole scene, though, or he rewinds the action back a few steps and says, "Instead, at this point, do this." So it's not all "Yes and..."<br/>
<br/>
There are some powerful techniques in that book. Frex, I love shelving. That's when you take an idea of the other player and put it aside for the moment. Later in the act/story, at an appropriate moment, you whip it back out. And suddenly things tie together and it seems like you planned it all along. Cool stuff.                        </div>

                            Yes. Improv is great, especially for players like mine, who are fully-fledged immersionists. We've tried a couple of warmups before our games, and they worked great. Definitely something we will use in future sessions.<br/>
<br/>
A good source of improv techniques and explanations is http://www.humanpingpongball.com/<br/>
<br/>
Books: Keith Johnstone's "Impro" and "Impro for Storytellers". Great stuff.<br/>

                            The blocks and dodges that Jack listed are the rules that <i>Once Upon a Time</i> should have included as things you can't do. OUaT is essential an improv game.<br/><br/>Still, I think there's a place for vetting mechanics in RPGs. Because there's no audience, you have no sense of immediacy. "Yes, And" exists for live performance where you can't negotiate without boring the fuck out of the audience. When you're the audience, and you have hours and hours of future gaming at stake, you want to negotiate the fiction a bit.<br/><br/>First Game<blockquote><br/>Bob: So my dude Conan runs up to your dude Krull and lops off his head with his sword! I'm so cool!<br/>Karen: What the hell? Asshole. Fine. <i>Yes, and</i> Krull takes a dying shot at Conan and splits him in half. We're both dead.<br/>Bob: I guess we make up new characters?<br/>Karen: Why bother.</blockquote>
Yeah, I know all the old adages about not designing for idiot players. There's more to it than designing for idiots though. You can have one player who just has a remarkably different vision than the other four players, and he's really not being an idiot because we've told him that the group has to accept his vision as equal to theirs. He might not be lopping off a PC's head, but he might be killing off an NPC that the rest of the group was going to use in a future plot. <br/><br/>With no audience other than the actors themselves, why not negotiate?  Not that I have firsthand knowledge, but I don't imagine screenwriters sitting around a conference table with "Yes, And" rules. <br/><br/>Every participant should always <i>strive</i> for "Yes, And" and perhaps be encouraged and rewarded by the rules for doing so, but they should also be allowed to negotiate when they don't like something being introduced into the fiction.                        </div>

                            Adam, the more I learn about improv, the more I appreciate the difference between "yes, and" and <em>agreement</em>.  You can have conflict but it is predicated on the players agreement.  Monty Python's "I'd like to have an argument" sketch is the example of this used in the improv book I am currently reading (Truth in Comedy).  <br/><br/>In improv, if the other guy lops off an NPCs head, <em>awesome</em>.  He's just given you a gift.  If you had a plan for that guy, <em>that was your mistake</em>.  How well this translates into gaming remains to be seen.                        </div>

However I think that the place that should not happen is during an actual game session. Because you are the audience, and you are just as likely to get bored with the negotiation process, particularly if you aren't directly involved in the negotiation.                        </div>

                            It's a tradeoff, Jack. If you're bored with the negotiation process, just say Yes. If you're not, negotiate away till you reach a compromise that makes everyone happy.<br/><br/>The audience at a comedy show doesn't get that choice.<br/><br/>As for being an uninvolved player during a negotiation, games just need a "get on with it" mechanic.                        </div>
