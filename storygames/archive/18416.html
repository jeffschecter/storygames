We're not talking about Aunt Jenny's lucky spool of thread which she only brings out when sewing wedding veils for the family; whatever monstrous forces are tied up in that are not going to be called out by her little foot-pump Singer even if it stabs her a hundred times in the hand.<br/><br/>We're talking about all kinds of weird and ominous occult relics - some with major effects, some with minor, but all in the hands of people, if you can call witches "people" anymore, who have real knowledge of what they are and what they're for.<br/><br/>Now we would love to grab these things but occult repo ain't like boosting a car for a bank. We need intel, and that's where you come in.<br/><br/>In this thread, post:<br/><br/>* strange/mysterious items - they might be mouldering old books from the beginning of time or they might be some weird 1980s government project that they thought didn't work.<br/><br/>* what witch, warlock, cultist or satanist has the item and what they want it for.<br/><br/>If you get intel on one but not the other, help out the other people in the thread. <br/><br/>If someone mentions a witch they've been spying on, tell them what type of occult relic they have so they know what they're dealing with.<br/><br/>If someone's been tracking an occult item or some kind and loses track of where it is, tell them what cult has got their hands on it and why.<br/><br/>Here's one I found stuck to a <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/66026/90-phenomena-in-the-city-of-copenhagen" rel="nofollow">bulletin board in Copenhagen</a> even though it actually applies to a situation in my city:<br/><br/>There's a convenience store that used to be, I don't know, something else, and at a particular time on a particular night if you go into the back room and use a dime that was minted in a year OTHER than the year you were born, and dial a phone number, you will hear what happened in the room where that phone number was on the day you went into the store, at the time you called minus twelve hours (so, the daytime), in the year on the dime.  If you have a dime that is from the year you were born...you'll hear something else.<br/><br/>It's the payphone that has that strange mechanism in it, the one they got off the bottom of the ocean all those years ago.   The dimes are the punch cards for it, so to speak, but what actually makes the thing run, what gives it its juice...that I don't know yet. Nobody's been able to see any sacrifices taking place around the place...<br/><br/>And I don't know who owns the convenience store or why they let these rumors get around - maybe they want people to use the phone for some reason. <br/><br/>Anyone hear anything about this, or about their own weird items/relics?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414894/#Comment_414894" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-29T05:04:52+00:00" title="May 29, 2013  5:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I'm concerned, <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/" rel="nofollow">the American government</a> has been doing a pretty good job in this regard already.

The convenience store is owned (on paper) by Moishe Yamagata, but he's backed by a shadowy cabal of sorcerers that goes by the original name of "The Shadowy Cabal of Sorcerers." Apparently a ritual was cast at some point since the invention of the telephone that they REALLY want to get a copy of, but they have no idea when, where, or by whom. They've set up the payphone thing as a sort of "Mechanical Turk" - they're hoping that someone will eventually dial the right number on the right date with the right dime, so the cabal doesn't have to do something really extreme like research.<br/><br/>Oh, and the birth year thing is a glitch. A VERY BAD glitch. Do not do it. If you'd seen what happened to Alice you wouldn't question me.<br/><br/>I could use some help, too. There's this group that meets in the basement of the Unitarian Church down the street once a month on the full moon. They have some hippie granola name like "Moonstarcraftcircle" or something, but it's clear that they're much more than they seem. I'm pretty sure I saw one of them get hit by a car (no, I wasn't drinking, although I may have been driving) and get up without a scratch.

They're about the size of a dime, too. Don't know what number ya have to dial on that pay phone but I'm pretty sure the area code is 666.<br/>  As for Maria - I'll give Ron Jeremy a call. Owes us one for his "career".<br/>  Got bigger problems, though. Tha'Rool's Book has surfaced again. Translated from Akkadian Empire cylinders, it detailed "The Curse of Akkad" and then the Empire fell. Thought to have been linked to the Minoan volcano eruption. Later turned up as tablets translated (in a hat,no less) by  Joseph Smith. Possible source for "Mein Kampf",the play "The King in Yellow", and the fictional "Necronomicon". No-one translates the damn thing the same way; makes it hard to track until the damage is done. Now some bone-head has put it on the internet in PDF format; as a fucking role-playing game!

I'm not a pro like you guys, but I think I have some important information, and everyone else thinks I'm crazy, so here goes . . .<br/><br/>I live in Pyrite Colorado, and there is this historic opera house near my house that was actually pretty famous around the turn of the century. A lot of names you've heard of performed there or saw shows. John Philip Sousa, Theodore Roosevelt, the Emperor and Empress of Japan, &amp;c. Anyway, in 1936, it was abruptly closed down after an unexplained fire in the dancers' dormitory killed 12 girls. That same year, there were several other murders that were never solved. After the fire, the murders stopped. Anyway, in the last year, there have been 3 murders which were very similar to the ones in in the 30s. Pyrite is a little mountain town; there are only about 1800 people -- 3 murders in a year is insane.<br/><br/>The opera house opened up again in the early 70s as a local tourist attraction, but it's obviously not the international draw it once was. I was in there the other day with my girlfriend, and I saw an old picture on the wall of those dancers who were killed. Except there were 13 girls in the picture not 12. I did some research, and the 13th girl was named Lucy Bernard. She evidently wasn't killed in the fire, but there is no record of what happened to her. In the picture, she was wearing a pendant with a symbol I didn't recognize. <br/><br/>Here's the weird part -- the other day, I saw a local girl named Annie Circle wearing the SAME pendant. Annie Circle and her family moved to Pyrite right around the time the murders started. Could Annie Circle be a witch? Is that pendant important? Is she related to Lucy Bernard in some way? I thought you guys might know something I don't.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415013/#Comment_415013" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T09:06:53+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  9:06AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But what she's doing?

And just like the Ouija board, before the game went into mass production, there was an actual honest-to-Satan prototype that <i>really worked</i>.<br/><br/>At terrible cost, of course -- let's just say that while it was awfully nice when your mystery date turned out to be a dream, you really, really, truly did not want to end up with a dud. At least, not if you liked your family, your pets, your limbs, and in at least one terrible incident during early testing in 1961, your local 12-mile radius.<br/><br/>If this "Maria" has the original hand-crafted prototype that's rumored to have been circulating through thrift stores and yard sales (and estate sales...oh god, so many estate sales), that's bad news. I just hope that she's only playing it alone, because at least that way its powers are limited at best; it is intended for 2-4 players, and no one wants to see how that competition might end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415015/#Comment_415015" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T09:22:10+00:00" title="May 30, 2013  9:22AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2013 9:48AM by creases.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, for creating this secure page. I'm in a bit of a sticky situation myself, and I will owe a life debt for any coordination or assistance anyone can provide.<br/><br/>I have a good relationship with an antiques dealer in my city, one who knows my interests as a collector and who can normally be counted on to be discreet. About fifteen months ago, she managed to get her hands on a high priority artifact of interest. It's now in my possession in one of my hiding spots.<br/><br/>The item is a rectangular mirror, measuring 37" wide by 29" tall. The image it reflects is dark for objects more than two feet away, and objects more than six feet away are shrouded in total darkness, no matter how well lit the room is. Objects nearer than two feet are reflected as if lit by a white light from above---again, irrespective of the illumination of the room it's reflecting. The mirror is set in an ebony frame 4 1/2" wide, rising about 3/4" above the surface of the mirror. The top part of the frame is inscribed with Aramaic in classical letters, and translated, it reads, "You, too, have been wronged by the jealous hand." The bottom is inscribed in the same language, "They who have been held in darkness yet shall return."<br/><br/>I inspected the item only long enough to confirm that it matches the description of the Davmahzit Mit\xe9, the notorious "mirror of the dead" attested by the early demonologist and heresiographer Hilary the Armenian. According to Hilary, a degenerate circle of diabolists and pseudo-Gnostics operated in Latakia in the 3rd century. They crafted a mirror which allowed their initiates to speak to dead loved ones. Some reported what they saw in the mirror: images of their lost loved ones, whispering cruel and disgusting things to them. These apparitions would also reveal blasphemous mysteries and horrid secrets. Most initiates killed themselves within their first few months of involvement with the cult. Those who endured the moral toll would become priests and proselytes to the cult. Hilary reports that the Christians of the city rioted in 290 AD and scattered the cult for good, but the mirror was lost.<br/><br/>Of course, according to Hilary, the apparitions are not actually dead loved ones, but rather demons assuming their likeness for the purpose of misleading people, promoting idolatry, and sowing despair and horror. I have not experimented with the mirror any more than to confirm the optic effects I described above. I haven't tried to conjure the dead with it, and I'm keeping it covered in a location away from my house.<br/><br/>Since I acquired the mirror, I've been getting email requests from a would-be seller calling himself Peter Dafoy. I've been able to confirm that "Peter Dafoy" is a pseudonym for the warlock whose craft name is Arcesilaus, but I haven't been able to learn more about him. I don't know how he might have learned that I have the mirror, unless my dealer friend had some sort of lapse of discretion, which as I indicated would be out of character for her. In any event, I've been able to stall "Peter Dafoy" so far, but it's only a matter of time before I've tested his patience to the limit and he finds other means of getting at the mirror.<br/><br/>If any of you have any suggestions or can offer any assistance, it might save my life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415024/#Comment_415024" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-30T10:20:58+00:00" title="May 30, 2013 10:20AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.

Hm. Might be worth making a few inquiries there.<br/><br/>Anyway, you might also try looking into the legends of the Black Ship of Carthage, mentioned briefly by Lucius Marcius Censorius in his correspondence during the Third Punic War; the original manuscript is still held by a private collector, but there are a few different translations of it in circulation among the usual suspects. There are superficial similarities to the mirror you describe...ebony wood, the lighting effects, the revelation of horrible secrets. If the similarities run deeper than that, you might want to invest in some salt. If it works, it'll definitely reduce the resale value of the piece, but you might be a lot happier in the long run.

Dupont has been re-discovered.<br/><br/>So, a few words of warning to whoever is currently in possession of it:<br/><br/>- Just because a dead person is writing it, doesn't mean it's the <i>right</i> dead person. A forgery by a ghost is still a forgery, and in most cases, these aren't even <i>good</i> forgeries. Knowledgable collectors are still laughing about that whole "new Hemingway collection." There are ways to confirm an author's identity! Be smart and use them before you try to sell anything the pen writes!<br/><br/>- Be aware that at least two major cult organizations on the FBI's Omega List have been making serious efforts to acquire any and all of the objects stolen from the Carnegie collection in 1953; getting the pen would be a major coup for either of them, and -- if their prophecies are correct -- seriously bad news for the rest of us. I mean, I don't know if there's really a way to let the author "enter fully-fleshed into the world and thereby end it," but let's not find out, okay? Ward yourself, or learn to ward yourself!<br/><br/>- If you are ever mentioned by name in the text that the pen is currently writing, <i>stop immediately</i>, any way you possibly can. Cut off your hand if you have to. NOT JOKING EVEN A LITTLE BIT.<br/><br/><br/>On an unrelated note, my pals in Stockholm say that they've made good progress with that bluish-purple crystal array they dug up in Malawi ten years ago, and are now getting solid electromagnetic readings from it, and, I quote, "some translocation effects." They think full activation is going to require the assistance of "a starchild," but no one they've talked to knows what that means. An alien? A fallen angel?

I thought Branhope was a front for that cabal of racist sorcerors from South America, just an efficient way to separate the power-hungry from their bank accounts. I swear, you could fill a bus terminal with all the witless proto-dictators and lich-wanna-bes who were 100% convinced that they had an unabridged Branhope in their hot little hands.<br/><br/>I always figured the burning thing was pure showmanship. Lead your suckers to page 112, let 'em follow the instructions and torch the book, then slip a new copy in their bookcase while they're still finishing out the ritual. It couldn't be for real...could it?<br/><br/>...oh, see, now I'M on the hook. Jesus. No fool like an old fool.<br/><br/>Okay, look, if there IS a real Branhope Anthology (and I'M NOT SAYING THERE IS), you ought to see some of the usual marks on its owner. I'm talking lambent orange waves running through their aura, a bluish tinge under the fingernails, affinity with snakes, and disturbed earth around the parents' graves. That's not proof, I know, but it's a start. The major manifestations would be more of a direct giveaway, but I'm in the camp that says if you ever actually saw those things, it'd be waaaaaay too late to do anything about it.<br/><br/>If the fire thing is true, it might just be that it's <i>not actually made out of paper</i>. Or out of <i>anything</i>, really: anyone else remember the rumors about the Lichtenstein Crucifix, circa 1973? Or Magra's Ascension (and her subsequent Escape) in '92? It might not be the same kind of focused planes of thought-energy hidden in plain sight, but it could very well be on the same order of phenomena, if you catch my drift. I wouldn't try any evocations or abjurations on it without proper containment, but feel free to dig your own grave there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415358/#Comment_415358" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T13:15:01+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  1:15PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Umm.

What is it that she's sending?</blockquote>\nFunny story I heard a long time ago:<br/><br/>So this guy was in a similar situation: he's a warlock of some weirdo flavor or another, got himself a pretty young apprentice, private sanctum, all the gewgaws and tchotchkes and whatever-those-things-are that you usually find when a witch or a warlock is nesting for a good long time, right? Except one day, his pretty young apprentice says, "Ciao, old man, I got a better gig over there," and takes up with a not-quite-rival in another city.<br/><br/>Burns him right up, of course, which is the whole point, but he's gotta save face, so he smiles and acts like he couldn't care less. And then he sends a gift to show just how fine he is with the whole situation. Nice little iron-bound coffer, thrice-forged locks, black velvet lining, and nestled snug and warm inside is the Crimson Ruby of Tsaidam. The same one Nicholas Roerich's son George brought back from their Asian expedition back in '28, right? George just thought it was valuable, but anyone with a little know-how can tell that the thing positively stinks with power.<br/><br/>This gift goes over like a dream. I mean, it's the only thing anyone wants to gossip about, how this warlock was all, "I wish you and my former apprentice all the best, here's a priceless object of unfathomable power as a housewarming gift."<br/><br/>Here's what made it a classic fuck-you move, though: he <i>knew</i> that these assholes didn't have enough mojo on their own or enough hard-won wisdom to really understand how the Ruby worked. Giving it to them was like handing a fully-loaded howitzer to a toddler, and sticking candy in the barrel on top of that. So about a year later, the apprentice-stealing rival and the former apprentice are just <i>hollowed out</i> by this Ruby they've been mucking around with; for every ounce of power they've taken from it, it's taken back one and a half, right? I think they died or were murdered or maybe just withered away or something, there were a lot of conflicting stories, and the Ruby came right back to this warlock, fatter and happier, and he locked it right back up and just smiled whenever anyone asked about it again. Creepy little smile.<br/><br/>Guy also saved spleens in jars for some reason. Like I said, weirdo. But he got a lot of respect out of that Ruby deal, no doubt about that.<br/><br/><br/>So to get back to your original question, here are a few things I heard changed hands in the past few months. Maybe one of them sounds like a thing this Black Bess lady might have sprung for:<br/><br/>- a knockoff Spear of Longinus forged by a Bavarian witch in 1214, confers immortality and martial prowess along with a few hidden vulnerabilities and a seriously raging case of paranoid delusions<br/>- half a case of homebrewed ambrosia, great for wild parties or orgies or orgy-parties, as long as you've got the Olympian stamina to survive the hangover<br/>- two or three old school grimoires, tricky bastards if you don't have the antiecclesiastical Latin skills to do your own proper translations<br/>- some kind of demon-summoning ritual out of Micronesia, I don't even want to know what it calls up but I heard it was maybe the thing that did all that shit in Melbourne last year (which would explain why it sold so fast!)<br/><br/>...any one of those would be a wicked little trap for any of your worst enemies who think they know a little more than they actually do. Seriously, what is it with these wand-wavers that makes them turn everything into a goddamned poison pill, right?<br/><br/><br/>edit: haha, WOW, I guess there's a reason I steered clear of witch-clique politics. I just talked about this over lunch with a Black Nun friend of mine, and she laid the unholy ruler across my wrists HARD.<br/><br/>Apparently witches have been playing this game since the pointy-hat and flying-cauldron days, and the thing to keep in mind is that it's basically like high school. The most important thing to know is what Black Bess's status is: if she's the big swinging dick in the coven, then she'll give a powerful gift that her rival can't handle. If she's the young up-and-comer, she might go with something that looks weak on the surface but has a nasty cumulative effect. But if she's the consigliere/power-behind-the-throne type, she'll opt out of doing direct harm in favor of getting an eyeball on what her rival is doing (maybe literally), so that she can get down to some serious plan-thwarting.<br/><br/>And if they are ACTUALLY IN high school, then it's exactly the same, but all the harm is directed at the rival's boyfriend or girlfriend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415702/#Comment_415702" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T17:49:44+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  5:49PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My sources at the FBI have been keeping me informed on the QT about "interesting" cases, so I know that <i>someone</i> in or around Oklahoma has been collecting the blood of virgins and sacrificing black goats on the nights of the new moon.</blockquote>\nHey, hey!

What is it that she's sending?</blockquote>\nI think Bess is exactly the kind of person to pull the "give a gift the rival can't handle" trick while also being a big fan of irony. I mean, she's old as hell, but you'd think she learned all her curse ideas reading issues of the Golden Age Spectre, right? So if she wants to send a middle finger, she should send an <i>actual </i>middle finger.<br/><br/>The middle finger of Pontius Pilate, that is. Oh, you think he was super happy with how that whole back and forth with the Sanhedrin went? You think he just washed his hands and walked away? Hell no, he flipped the bird to the whole lot of them. Those New Testament writers sure were prudish about the weirdest details.<br/><br/>Anyway, he flips off the Sanhedrin, who then get egg all over their faces when an empty tomb sours their big play three days later. The touchier elements of the Sanhedrin regift Judas's thirty pieces of silver to the current Witch of Endor who throws a curse at Pilate's offending finger.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Pilate gets a little fingernail fungus and his luck just goes straight south. More rebellions, more unrest, more angry finger shaking from Rome. His wife goes nuts from the nonstop stream of nightmares she starts having, all of which involve her violation via middle finger. That fungus spreads, turns to gangrene, starts to smell, and finally grows a small mouth that screams out obscenities in gutter Latin.<br/><br/>He had to get rid of it, right? So he gives the talkative little bastard the chop. Lots of rumors after that. Pilate tries to burn it, but it just laughs at him. Nero gets it in his possession and goes <i>crazier</i>. It vanishes when Visigoth's sack Rome, but resurfaces in the hands of a whole bunch of evil bastards starting in the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>So why is this such a hot gift? Word around the campfire is that the finger still talks and has gathered all kinds of occultic information over two thousand years. And it'll share every bit of it. The more eager you are, the faster it gives. Total novices have been known to immolate themselves or crumble to dust within a couple hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415764/#Comment_415764" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-08T23:47:12+00:00" title="June  8, 2013 11:47PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hey, hey!
