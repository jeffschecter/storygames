So I'll probably do that soon.<br/><br/>You play one of the four Chaos gods - Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh, and Tzeentch - the gods of war, pestilence, pleasure, and magic basically. The play style varies differently based on who you're playing. You have different unit types - Khorne is fighty and Nurgle is plentiful but squishy. You also have different ways of scoring points - Khorne gets points for killing things and Tzeentch collects warpstone that's scattered around the map, and Nurgle wants to corrupt big cities and Slaanesh wants to corrupt wealthy areas.<br/><br/>But there is also one way that all the gods score points and that's by corrupting territories. You drop cultists into a region and the region accumulates corruption tokens. Once it gets X amount of corruption tokens, the area is ruined and has fallen to Chaos and you harvest points based on how much your cultists corrupted it. So basically, competing over a region is a good move but if all the Chaos gods focus their attention on it it's just going to fall into ruin immediately.<br/><br/>This makes it almost like a war game. Almost. For Khorne it's still kind of a wargame, but for everyone else it's a weird dance. We discovered this in the first game we played where there was a region that something everyone wanted - a city, wealth, and a warpstone. So we all pile on demons and cultists and then Khorne shows up because its his kind of party. We barely throw down and the region is immediately ruined and corrupted by Chaos. So we just hemorrhaged all these resources to drop units into a region that we immediately corrupted and was then useless to us. We managed to eke out a couple points but really we would have done better to spend our resources spreading out into other areas and corrupting them rather than squabbling.<br/><br/>Not that squabbling doesn't have its purpose. If someone tries to drop a cultist into a region you're trying to corrupt, dropping a demon there and murdering them is a good idea. Oh and there's also magic so you can drop spells specific to your god. Khorne's spells make fights nastier, and Tzeentch's spells are just generally fuckery, teleporting his dudes around and cancelling out the things other gods are trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Another thing you can spend resources on is upgrading any of your troop types to a meaner, nastier version. Usually the can take and give more damage, and might get some new special abilities.<br/><br/>I'd get into more specifics but it's been awhile. I'm thinking about dropping by a game shop and picking it up tomorrow though. Talking about it has gotten me all hot and bothered.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281969/#Comment_281969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T16:47:36+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  4:47PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh Christ, I can't spend anymore money man!

It is insta-ruined. Basically a region of the Old World is turned into a hell on earth because for whatever reason the Chaos gods have decided to make that their battleground. And of course, once it's ruined it's worth nothing to them so they move on.<br/><br/>You really do kind of feel like this horrible, powerful malevolence that's corrupting and ruining everything for its amusement. It's a great premise for a board game.<br/><br/>Oh and the humans will sort of fight back. Heroes will show up and mess with you and slay your demons, but really they're just an annoyance. Maybe in this one area a hero managed to strike down your demons, but really it's just keeping you at bay for a little while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281989/#Comment_281989" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-20T20:07:50+00:00" title="July 20, 2010  8:07PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game rules; one of my recent favorites.

A pretty average sort of Ameritrash game, I thought - I was particularly displeased by the awfully strong kingmaking inclination caused by the race mechanics; it's relatively easy for players to drop out of the contest for victory, especially with beginners, leaving them with massive amounts of ability for messing with each other's play but no particular motivation in doing so. Aside from that it's not a bad zero-sum multiplayer strategy game as long as you have a high-quality group for it: the players need to be of roughly equal skill level and motivation with a good house style for managing kibbitzing, otherwise it can be intolerable to sit there and watch some sunday gamer ruin your play because he's just putting down random stuff and not thinking it through. Being sensitive to group uniformity is a common, all but inherent failing of this style of game, though, so not really this particular game's fault. The part that offended my game design sensibilities the most were the relatively tame random card draws - FFG house style in game design often includes a random deck you draw a card or two out of every turn, and I have to say that I like this mechanic much more when those per-round random effects are drastic and temporarily game-changing; in this case my experience was that most of those cards didn't really amount to much, as they came up at wrong junctures to matter or were simply pretty inconsequential. The same goes for the spell cards, many of those are just jokes for no good reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282033/#Comment_282033" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T04:46:42+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  4:46AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero didn't like this game!<br/><br/>How long does a game take to play through, guys?

Just my opinion, and not a particularly common one at that - I'm definitely an outlier on most boardgaming preference curves.<br/><br/>The game plays in a couple of hours, plus however long your group takes in thinking things through and debating the optimal leader-hampering stratagems. Three hours is realistic for most groups I play with, I'd say. It's no more complex than the average FFG strategy game, such as Game of Thrones; entirely feasible to teach in half an hour before the first play-through. The theme is relatively well-utilized, I liked how care was taken to make the different chaos gods behave differently. It'd have been nice to get a more proactive "Old World"; as it is, the impact of non-chaotic forces is rarely felt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282043/#Comment_282043" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T06:05:18+00:00" title="July 21, 2010  6:05AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three hours, really!

The multiple paths to victory, though, that doesn't really help with the king-making much when the game goes into that stage. It's true that most players will probably have a window of opportunity in either victory points or on that wheel thingy, but it's not difficult to analyze the situation and winnow the real contenders once the game draws to a close - when we played this basically came down to the players in third and fourth place having to choose which of the two top contestants to foil so the other could win the game. The fact that one was winning on the wheel while the other wasn't that fundamental.<br/><br/>My opinion on the matter isn't so much based on the actual play experience of course, and it is possible that I'll find the game more balanced when I play more. It's true that the color of the game is nicely done and it plays relatively quickly, so I don't have an objection for playing a couple more games to get a better handle on how it runs. My analysis after one game just points towards the game having a lot of king-making in an uneven group due to how you can get played out early without also losing your ability to influence play. This is typical of hybrid Ameritrash that keeps the zero-sum bash-the-leader multiplayer angle of the classical recipe while adding Eurogame-style victory points and game-end conditions; when you put both of those things into one game it's very easy to get something where your ability to influence the game has no relationship at all with your ability to win it, which results in a larger quotient of kingmaking than your average boardgame has. Of course an even group or a game where it's easy to keep up helps this, and perhaps Chaos in the Old World is like that - I've only played it once, as I said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Old%20Scratch" title="Old Scratch"><img alt="Old Scratch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Old%20Scratch">Old Scratch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282350/#Comment_282350" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T08:03:05+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  8:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I question the assumption about the Bash-the-Leader conclusion. That's the challenge with the game, each side plays a little differently and you can't be certain who the leader is. Some of the sides advance on the dial (usually with Khorne taking a quick lead but Slaanesh moving up very quickly behind) and Nurgle rushing along the point track. In fact, Nurgle often catches up later as areas become ruined and suddenly Nurgle starts raking in the points. So I think your central concern doesn't exist in this game to the extent you suggest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282388/#Comment_282388" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T09:19:46+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  9:19AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 9:20AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah every time I've played it's never been quite clear who was in the lead or was going to win.<br/><br/>Though usually we all just gang up on Khorne, because the blood god is an asshole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282399/#Comment_282399" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T09:41:11+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  9:41AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a really solid 4-player game.  It was a complete impulse buy for me at the beginning of the year, but I haven't regretted it at all.  Though the first couple times I played, there was always one big argument over rules (for which I blame the usual poorly edited FFG rulebooks) and I joked that we were being tainted or possessed by the Chaos Gods.<br/><br/>These days my only real complaint about the game is the upgrade cards.  It seems quite obvious that some of the upgrade cards are very weak in comparison to others and, since you'll never get more than three out of five of them in a given game, there's simply no reason to choose some of them.  This is very disappointing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
