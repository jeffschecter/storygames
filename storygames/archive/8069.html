How does this look to you?<br/><br/><a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Dogs_with_Cards" rel="nofollow">Dogs with Cards</a><br/><br/>Anyone want to give it a spin?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178081/#Comment_178081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T15:14:51+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  3:14PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, looking at it from my own perspective:<br/><br/>* The adjustment to Stats is twice as significant as in regular Dogs. I don't see this causing an issue with Stat reduction, but it might cause an issue with people raising Stats.<br/><br/>An easy fix might be: your four Stats, added together, may never exceed 9. If your Stats already add up to 9, when you increase a Stat you must decrease another Stat.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how important increasing Stats in Dogs is anyway--the other Fallout options are much more interesting. So maybe increasing Stats should be restricted to regaining lost points? <br/><br/>* It might be interesting to increase the value of face cards, or distinguish between different face cards.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>-Face cards are worth the same number of points but retain their hierarchy: for example, you can't See a King with a Jack.<br/><br/>-Face cards have different point values: Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13, or Jack = 12, Queen = 14, King = 16. The advantage to this is that higher Raises can be Reversed (see below). The downside is having to remember numbers. I don't like that much.<br/><br/>* One interesting thing I realized about Dogs rules while doing this is that any Raise of 11 or more (a 6 or higher if using cards) canNOT be Reversed. So, you know when you're making that you're "safe" when you're making such a Raise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
