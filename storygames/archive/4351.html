The first problem can be easily overcome by me reading the book. The second one I am hoping to get some help from the players and you fine people.<br/><br/>The idea for the game was slightly based of the first Sin City book where Marv wakes up with a dead hooker and sirens blazing in the distance. The plot is bigger than it seems at first and introduces the reader to the major players in the city. This is basically what I want for at least the first session of the game as all the players are unfamiliar with the game to a degree.<br/><br/>So the way I want to set it up is that the guy who wakes up with the dead girl, is not a PC. Maybe a boss\xe2\u20ac\u2122 son. The players are a group of \xe2\u20ac\u02dccleaners\xe2\u20ac\u2122 who have only had 2 or 3 jobs together but are trusted by this NPC. He calls them into help them out and it all goes from there. Each of the players will have loyalties to the others and also some that tie them into the plot and background I am setting up.<br/><br/>So here is where I would like some help <br/><br/>1) Does the basic set-up sound ok?<br/><br/>2) Character Creation: There are a few paths I could choose here which do you think would be best<br/>a) Pre-gens<br/>b) Partial pre-gens: where I fill out some details I think are relevant to the game and leave the rest up to the players.<br/>c) Full character generation: which will let them understand from the off what everything means.<br/><br/>3) I will be producing some cheat sheets for the players with the following info:<br/>a) Poker Hand ranks<br/>b) Conflict sequence<br/>c) Consequences of combat<br/>Anything else I should give them?<br/><br/>Any thoughts appreciated<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98215/#Comment_98215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T14:15:20+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  2:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Partial pre-gens where the players get to choose how they hook onto a relationship map, motivations or plots is good.

I wouldn't, however, say the game was a failure. I saw potential, but I couldn't quite get how it was supposed to run with the stakes and raises and poker chips and all that. Its a bit... well, both over complex and over simplified at the same time, the way it was going for me anyway.<br/><br/>The other thing that confused me was why it used poker at all - its a very atmospheric, thematic mechanism for a roleplaying game to use, and I kinda didn't see how it linked in with the Mobsters/connections idea that the game is about. With a better reason for doing all that, I would have had a better buy in to the feel of the game.<br/><br/>Oh, and I don't have a copy of MJ any more since I broke up with Liam, so no pre-reading was on the cards for me. Yes, I intend to get my copy back from him one day, but it won't be soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98292/#Comment_98292" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T09:08:11+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  9:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if we just play the game and trust the rules we'll be fine.

I've never had it demo'd or sold to me in any way, and hadn't the slightest idea what we were going to be playing. So faced with a system which seems, at first glance, to have little to do with the game, I had no buy in, and I was looking for something to get my teeth into. A lot of that comes from the fact that my vision of Mob Justice was as a 1920's gangster film, and I had no association in my mind between that and playing poker. Several days later, Liam helped me make that logical leap by mentioning casinos and such like, whereupon I realised that, 1920's stylings aside, this game has more in common with the Sopranos than the Untouchables. This is not a bad thing, but it wasn't really clear and, as such, I couldn't see why I was doing the things I was doing, cards and poker chips-wise. It got frustrating, though I apologise if I didn't handle my frustration elegantly.<br/><br/>The system was pretty much the only thing I had an issue with in this game, and I know a lot of that is probably because I need to understand how the rules work so I know how to manipulate them - including what I'm supposed to be able to gain from the various options I have. Rules are what make something a game for me, rather than just a story time session with my friends, and if there's to be a game, I need to be able to <i>play</i> it. Just doing what other people recommend is not playing, and making choices based on the rules without knowing what the repercussions are makes me feel like I may as well just sit and watch other people play.<br/><br/>As very little of this actually reflects on Mob Justice as a game, but rather on the particular game session and on my own preferences, I too am looking forward to the next game session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98333/#Comment_98333" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T14:10:02+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  2:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's so hard about it using cards? I really think you have a bug up your ass about this, and if you could put your wariness of that aside you'd find that actually the game is very easy to play.<br/><br/>The game system is <em>not</em> about playing poker. Let me repeat,we are not playing poker during the game and you should put all notions of this aside.<br/><br/>I really think you threw up a barrier about the system and didn't want to engage with it at all. Personally, I think this is stupid and you should just get on with it and play the game.<br/><br/>You say that doing what other people recommend is not playing and I agree. But, Shevy, I think you have this weird notion that there is always a "right" thing to do or something? Or that there is some "winning" choice that can be found <em>a priori</em> and applied to any given situation. That is not the case. At each point of the system there are choices and you as a player have to make them on behalf of your character.<br/><br/>As best, and as simply, as I can here is how Mob Justice works.<br/><br/>(i) We say fictional stuff between ourselves and the GM.<br/>(ii) At some point someone disagrees and, if they are suitably interested in having their way, they stick a story chip in the middle of the table. This chip is being risked by the player or the GM, in the hope that they get their way and story chips back if they win,<br/>(iii) The player who stuck the story chip in gets some cards based on their skills and what they are doing. They then make a "poker hand". The other players don't get to see the hand yet but they have seen how many cards it was formed from.<br/>(iv) Everyone else then has the option to get involved in the conflict. Whether they actually do so is their choice. If no one chooses to then the original player gets their story chip back and gets their way.<br/>(v) If people want to get involved they stick a story chip in, which they will lose to someone else if they don't win. In return they get cards and the chance to get their goal. Again other players don't get to see the cards themselves but they do get to see the number of cards it was formed from.<br/>(vi) Play then proceeds between the interested parties in turn. They have the choice to<br/>-fold, i.e. give up and cut their losses, where they bow out of the conflict<br/>-call, saying "I've invested enough story chips, let's see if I win"<br/>-raise, make the other players put in more story-chips to stay in the conflict (this could be an attempt to "buy" a win, or to extract more story chips from other players if they are confident of their hand)<br/>(vii) The cards are shown and someone wins, they get their goal and to "set" what happened. They also collect all the story chips risked in the middle.<br/><br/>Why you would want to fold, raise or call is something that you should only judge at the moment you have to make that choice in game. How good is your hand? How badly do you want to achieve your goal? How many chips do you have to risk? Is it worth the risk? Can you gain story chips out of this conflict? And so on. The answer will be different for each and every conflict.<br/><br/>You say "I'm sure the system works really well when you know what you're trying to do, but you have to factor in that I know nothing about Mob Justice." That just blows my mind. As a player you say to the other players "Hey, I want my character to do this in the game. How do I do it?" And we say, "Well, if you want to do that then you do (a). You can also do (b) or (c), but you want to do (a)." Then you throw your hands up and say "doing what other people recommend is not playing."<br/><br/>Really, I played AD&amp;D in the early 1990s. I did not have a clue what I could do or not do, but I asked my other players and the GM. "Hey, I want to do <em>this</em>" and they said "Oh, in that case roll this and you want to get 15 or better" or "Cast that spell". So, I did. I just got on with playing.<br/><br/>I don't know if this helps any, but needlessly worrying about the system is getting in the way of you having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98358/#Comment_98358" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T19:25:53+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  7:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll chat with you about this tomorrow, if you don't mind.

I don't know if you want to flag them explicitly as Enemies/Friends or let the players pick which ones they want to have as Enemies/Friends? But that way you might have a stock list of NPCs available to to the GM to use one way or the other.<br/><br/>I like partial pre-gens as it is quick enough to just jump in and start, but you allow the player to customize enough that they're happier with the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98529/#Comment_98529" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T04:58:49+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:58AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor has just about got it right there, but I am going to be working on a proper break down sheet for how conflicts work.<br/><br/>Shevy I can totally understand your problems with the system, this was partly due to my bad explanation. I must and will do better next time around. The reason I chose poker is that for me the gangster/noir films I love contain some great backroom poker scenes and also the connections liam mentioned to Las Vegas and casinos in general. I just wanted something a bit different for the game and poker felt like the right fit so I ran with it. It is important to remember that it is poker based rather than poker itself.
