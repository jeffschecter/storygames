It occurs to me that Gencon wants roughly 50% more than Essen Spiel for a similar booth, which I have to admit feels pretty heavy for a convention with 20% of the audience. The sharing fee is about three times what it is at the Spiel.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, an early advertisement: our booth at Spiel last year was a success by most metrics, and I'm keen to do it again this year. Anybody wanting to join us in late fall can expect an even smoother operation than last time, as we now have experience with the various issues of the project, as well as most of the suitable furniture already at hand. Not that many Gencon-goers are likely to pass on it to fly to Germany, of course, even with those prices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309866/#Comment_309866" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T09:08:42+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  9:08AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, <br/>Can you do a similar cost breakdown for Essen?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309869/#Comment_309869" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T09:33:54+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  9:33AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure. This is from memory:<br/><br/>The smallest booth costs ~500 \u20ac + taxes and certain mandatory extras such as walls, which comes to something like 850 euros total, roughly. This is the 2mx5m booth, roughly similar to the basic Gencon booth in size. For larger booths the price goes up on the basis of acreage and open faces like usual, except for the fact that the above price is the small-press discount price for being willing to have the small booth - a 20 square meter booth costs something like triple the above for this reason. Extra companies beyond one at the booth cost 100 \u20ac extra, being a retailer instead of a publisher costs 100 \u20ac extra, too. Furniture from the fair is pretty expensive - there are many options, but they're all business kitch in style and cost something like 50 \u20ac per square meter or 100 \u20ac per table or the like. (I've got the inventory as PDF if anybody wants to see something boring.) We did joint pallet shipping from Finland for our furniture and inventory, which came to cost a couple of hundred euros or so. Hotel plus flights cost us 350 \u20ac per head from Helsinki as a three-man crew sharing a room.<br/><br/>In total I seem to remember that attributed Arkenstone expenses for the convention came to roughly 1500 euros; counting everybody who participated it's probably something like 2700 \u20ac for the entire operation, travel, accomodations and all - under 3000 \u20ac anyway. I'm a bit hazy on the final numbers at this point, partly because my bookkeeper brother is being lazy about pulling last year's books together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309873/#Comment_309873" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T09:43:51+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  9:43AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2011 9:44AM by Teataine.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CROSSPOST<br/><br/>I'm sure Eero will be able to say more but the mini booths 10m^2 go for 537\u20ac+VAT. Bigger booths are 89\u20ac+VAT per square meter. That's official info from last year off their <a href="http://www.internationalespieltage.de/e020.php4" rel="nofollow">page</a>. I don't know how big the GenCon booths are.<br/><br/>The rest is speculation. <br/>No idea about furniture or shipping. <br/>Food...it matters a lot on where and what you want to eat but I guess for the four days that the fair lasts you'd probably be on 150\u20ac+ (or as little as 60$ if you're a cheapskate) so maybe a <i>bit</i> cheaper. I guess accommodation can be a lot cheaper if you aren't too worried about how many stars your room has...200\u20ac for a hostel room, for the duration? If you want something more luxurious, like the Sheraton, then it's going to cost you something closer to 800\u20ac for a two bed room for the duration, at a slightly more mid-range hotel some 500\u20ac (with breakfast). Although I'm certain food and accomodation prices are higher during the fair. <br/><br/>Arifare/transport? A quick check tells me that a ticket from London to Dortmund (couldn't find direct flights to Essen) is between 50\u20ac-100\u20ac both ways if you're flying with EasyJet. That's of course rather uncomfortable and the cheapest you'll get. Car or train would cost a little more. If you're coming over then pond, then that's a different story.<br/><br/>So at a glance, Essen looks considerably cheaper on average. Depends on how stingy you want to be.<br/><br/>DERAIL                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309874/#Comment_309874" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-27T09:44:29+00:00" title="January 27, 2011  9:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of PAX, is anybody planning on getting a table at PAX Prime this year?

They will fuck you out of your money while calling it goodwill.<br/><br/>They picked up a ton of books from at least 4 different indie publishers/groups, and in every case sold most or all of them, but did not pay out until at least 5-6 months of repeated phone calls, visits, harassment, etc. In some cases (ours), they have not paid out at all.<br/><br/>Most recently, in the case of one group I work with, after 6 months of our rep contacting them over and over again with the same invoice, information and number of books, they have now suddenly said "Huh, I have suddenly produced a record which shows that we only accepted half of all your books, so we only owe you half. Send us yet another invoice to reflect this and we'll pay you half", while responding to a 6-month email train where they acknowledged how much they owed over and over. Presumably, if we capitulated to this new made-up number then maybe after 6 months of constant nagging they'll finally pay it, or send another revised invoice for half of /that/.<br/><br/>I won't call out the other "indie bestsellers" (lol, but yeah) that were also scammed by The Dreaming, but the story is pretty much the same. Only after our constant harassment and angry exchanges will they begrudgingly pay out what they promised to. Some folks finally got paid; others did not.<br/><br/>Don't bother with them.
