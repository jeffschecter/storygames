What is interesting is that they said that the raison d'etre for such groups is that there seems to be a notable lack of actual rites of passage in our culture. Oh, sure, everyone goes to high school. Most everyone gets a driver's liscence. Some kids will have some sort of rite through their religion - like confirmation for Catholics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how do those hold up in terms of spiritual passage? Well, they're either rare enough, or ineffective enough... or seem to somebody to be... that such organizations like the above one have sprung up to fill the void. Some claim that where there exists moral descent in our culture (if it does exist), it may largely be due to problems with morals not being transmitted to children because they never grow into responsible adults. I'm not here to argue either way, but it's interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me be more concrete. I think that I went through a powerful rite of passage in that I went through basic training in the military. Recently, or so I hear, they tend to "coddle" the trainees a bit more than in earlier times. In my day it was pretty stressful (enough so that they had to worry about suicide quite a lot). I know that having gone through it has made a huge impact on my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet there are days that I feel that I'm just a big kid. Really big kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not too worried about me, however. Or you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm worried about my kids. As a lapsed Catholic (one that never even got confirmed), I don't have a whole lot of spiritual guidance coming at my kids. Oh, sure, they get fallout from their social context. I'm not worried about them becoming bad kids. We do teach them morals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm worried about how they're going to grow up. How they're going to become adults. How they're going to know that they've passed from being a child into being a person of responsibility. Rites of passage are pretty much universally about a child metaphorically dying and being reborn as an adult. That's no small thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this have to do with RPGs?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think that RPGs are excellent tools for transmitting values. To me, in fact, I find them a replacement for what people have said were once the oral traditions of moral passing between peoples of a culture. They have all of the elements of myth-telling. Not Story-telling, but myth-telling. If in a collaborative way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's like as if a group of elders are getting together to tell the tales that enumerate the values of the culture. To me, at least... call me crazy if you will.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the rite of passage is the story of how one passes from childhood to adulthood. The path that's followed in the rite can and should be informed by the individual, but also by a narrative. I think that RPGs can form that narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut plainly, I'm thinking of designing a rite of passage for my kids. And using RPGs as a platform from which to conduct it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll stop here and get some feedback. I have more ideas about this, but I want to guage how crazy people think I am first.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67541/#Comment_67541" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T08:43:11+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  8:43AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why would it be crazy?

Transmitting moral values seems, to me, to harken back to illusionist GMing days, where if you killed the innocent priest and looted his body, well then, the GM gets pissy at you and throws a cave troll at you to punish you for making the wrong choice.

The oldest boy, now I think 20, has recently decided to get a tattoo - coming up with his own rite of passage (and not the worst possible one) in the absence of one supplied by society.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67645/#Comment_67645" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T15:37:12+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  3:37PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Incidentally, Josh, rites of passage aren't about moral values but social identity.</blockquote>\nI can get on board with that.

Traditional societies often distinguish different life stages by clothing, and part of the rite is frequently removing one set of clothing and putting on another.  One of my colleagues designed an adulthood rite which involved putting on a suit and tie. My nephew's prospective tattoo is actually quite a good example of an outward marker of this kind. <br><br>Hair can be used as well, or jewellery. One of the Pacific Islands - Niue, I think - have an adulthood rite for boys which involves cutting their hair.<br><br>In religious communities, the transition is often marked by full participation in the religious life of the community afterwards - after your bar mitzvah you count as part of the minyan, and after your confirmation you go up for Communion with the rest of the (religious) adults.<br><br>Part of the importance of a ritual is that the social group participates in it and so gets to see Jimmy go through the transition and regards him as different thereafter. A wedding is kind of an example, where the relationship between the couple is affirmed and witnessed by their social group as having changed (and there are outward marks too, in the form of jewellery; in some societies, the bride wears her hair differently afterwards or dresses differently, too, and/or the groom may now be able to participate in community decisionmaking).<br><br>So, to attempt to answer your question, in general terms: The group witnesses and affirms the change in status, through a ritual which symbolizes a death-and-rebirth. The newly adult person may now dress differently or wear other outward signs of adult status. And, crucially, he or she is now included with the adults in some activity reserved for them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67933/#Comment_67933" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:02:56+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:02PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, just to clear up what I think is a continuing misperception, I'll give an example from actual play that may demonstrate what I'm calling "transmission" here. I've used this example elsewhere, so forgive if you've heard it already.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was playing Heroquest with my son Alex, 6, and his character was an elf sorceress.* I had her come across this cave of sentient crystals who offered her vague powers of magical perception, if she would "join" with them. At first he answered no, and moved on. Then, later, when he felt that having some powers of perception could have been useful in another situation, he asked if he could change his mind and join. I allowed his character to join, and he got the powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, unsurprisingly perhaps, it turned out that the crystals had some demands on the character that were somewhat uncomfortable. Note that they weren't such that it would influence him to try to predict such hosings in the future. So what we have is strictly narrativism play from Alex in these regards. He's making the decisions based on "Is it worth it for the power in question."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson I transmitted later was "Always be careful what you sign on for."<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, after play, we talked about it. And he indicated that he was aware that getting involved with people who he didn't know much about was a dangerous thing to do. That he'd been considering it in play, and had seen from what I'd done later that he was right to have been potentially worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not against using an even more heavy hand here, up to and including illusionism. If that's the style that the parent thinks is going to be best. I prefer allowing the player to make decisions and, in fact, sometimes just having discussions about the ramifications afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same thing you do with your kid if you let them see iffy TV. "Though that man got away with stealing, you understand that stealing is bad, right?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a very difficult thing to nail down. But what people often ignore is that there are subtle social cues that go around the table in RPG play. You're not just making a decision to satisfy something in yourself, but understanding that there are social rewards for doing something "cool." Well, I do somewhat lean on Alex to play morally sound characters, where, if they do something bad, it's known by the player to be a mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player is allowed to create any theme they like in play... but are being taught values by which sorts of themes are socially rewarded by the other players here. This happens even with adults, but in a peer manner ("This is a community value that we're thinking about"). With kids it happens in a top-down manner ("This is a value that you should have.")<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, in a normal rite of passage, the story is sometimes immutable. You do precisely X, Y, Z, and then you're an adult. Using a RPG to do something like this would be far more flexible. Much more like the personal Vision Quest that's more informed by the myths at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of actual change and social identity, these are what I'm talking about. The child becoming the adult would, yes, after the ritual have real changes in the expectations of those around them as to their rights and responsibilities. This is about "values" in that the idea is to pass them to adulthood understanding what their responsibilities are as an adult. What values they'll be expected to uphold.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, moving the child beyond the notion of "I Am Assigned Responsibility" to "I Assign Myself Responsibility, and Am Responsible to do So." And just what sort of responsibilities that the child should then take on that way. For instance, I wouldn't require my child to donate to charity, but as an adult I would want to instill in them the notion that giving to charity is a responsibility that they need to take on when they identify a need in the community.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of obvious notions. To say nothing of the child being eligible to play in "Adult RPGs." As Fred points out, that's not the same thing as saying that we "elders" would still play with them. Just that they get to play with other adults as peers. FWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike, great breakdown. I think that the RPG covers parts of this, though not all. First, as for the witnessing group, the idea is that there would be either an audience, or other adult players in the game to be the witnesses. The play would be the ritual, or at least part of it. I'm tempted to add in more physicality to the challenge of the ritual, but, interestingly, I think that the virtuality of RPGs is somehow appropriate to becoming an adult in today's society. At least in my society which is largely internet attuned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the indicator to the community after the fact? Well, we could give him a Go Play ring or something. But it would be to just the smaller community. For the community that I live in called "Milwaukee" there's really nothing that you can use to distinguish somebody who has passed a ROP, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I think that this may largely be because of the lack of a hard commonly accepted ROP. I'm sure that if I was a Hasedic Jew that I might notice a difference between the men and the boys in terms of dress or something, but in our mixed community, I don't.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there's certainly the ritual portion. Being who I am, I can only suggest a classic Western civilization coming of age ritual, that of a page becoming a knight. In other words, I could put him in armor. (Once I have a good idea for the boy, who is older, I'll start thinking about a womanhood ritual for Diana). Not sure where I can get a good suit, but perhaps I can rent one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an idea. Possibly a tad geeky.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can tell, this is all quite a bit incohate as of yet. But it won't go anywhere if I don't start expressing the ideas that I'm having.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67952/#Comment_67952" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:18:34+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:18PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following up the above post...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of Guns in DitV, I think that's perfect, actually. DitV doesn't say that guns are a moral option, just an available option. The question of the morality of an escalation to lethal weapons is heightened by the fact that it's mechanically disparate. Not eliminated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the TPK system is the best to date in many ways for this sort of thing. Interestingly one thing that I'm not sure about is the fact that you play "princes" i.e. children. If it helps the person playing to feel closer to their character, then it might be a good thing. But if it does anything to say that the moral lessons are somehow juvenile ones, then it may not be right for this purpose. For my purpose, I need to be transmitting adult level value statements. Not just "be nice to people" but like the aforementioned themes of personal responsibility for being self-sacrificing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot a huge problem. A prince on the verge of being king might be perfect...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67956/#Comment_67956" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:21:21+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps a sampling of the lessons conveyed in some rites of passage to give us ideas what to design towards<br>\nor what rites some of us have gone through (Boot Camp for us military/former military types) in example                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67969/#Comment_67969" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T12:28:49+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 12:28PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The lessons are as varied as the cultures they come from, Tad, but in every case, the values that are instilled and recognized in rites of passage are by definition the ones on which the culture places the most emphasis.<br><br>Here is a rite of passage that most folks have some experience with: Learning to drive a car.  Most of us learned with the assistance of our parents and then tested by a higher authority.

Or so seems to be the perception. So a list is going to be hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I've mentioned basic training. That's a hard mental journey as much as a physical one. The result is, it is hoped, to have the resulting individual transformed into a soldier where they are recognized both as having a responsibility to their duties and as being capable of being assigned said duties. As well as a loyalty to the nation to which they've pledged their lives in defense, should it come to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nActual ROP to adulthood are very few. Again, many religions still cling to some vestige of ones from the olden days. I passed on becoming confirmed in the Catholic church, but it's a ROP to be sure. Not, from what I've seen of it (my mother teaches confirmation classes), a very demanding one. But a ROP nonetheless. And it does seem to have an effect, perhaps only in passing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned, the Jewish faith has the Bat- and Bar- mitsvahs. Not sure how prevalent these are today amongst the Jewish, but from an outsider's perspective, it seems to be one of the most legitimate sorts of ROPs left out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally these things are associated with faith, because (like a twelve-step program), what makes them potent is a sense of being held to something by a "Higher Power."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's something that has to be worked in to whatever I might come up with. Not that it has to be religious per se. Just that it has to have that sort of "weight" behind it. I recall in Boy Scouts that there were ceremonies that occured when one was promoted, following getting enough merit badges and such. I also recall feeling that these were really sorta... I dunno... fluffy. I'm searching for the right term. But, while not quite fraudulent, I felt that they hadn't really demarked anything important in any really important way. That even though the ceremonies were held with some level of pomp and circumstance, that the feeling I had when they were over was... "whatever."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has to be real.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70052/#Comment_70052" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T12:12:33+00:00" title="May 17, 2007 12:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason ROPs are not so prevalent these days is because there is more freedom of thought.<br><br>ROPs <i>indoctrinate.</i> If the Boy Scout (or Catholic) versions seem "fluffy", that's why.
