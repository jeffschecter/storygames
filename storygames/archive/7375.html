What can we learn from its success?<br/>\n<br/>\nOff the top of my head:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The game is awesome.<br/>\n- Gregor is very approachable, charismatic, and excited!<br/>\n- It's an easy pitch: Starshiptroopers where you don't roll to see how much damage you do, you roll to see how many aliens you kill!<br/>\n- John Harper: many people learn how to play RPGs from word of mouth rather than reading manuals. John Harper was this word of mouth. He taught us the game and then we quickly went on to teach others.<br/>\n- You can play through an entire reward cycle (make characters, defeat a planet, level up) in an hour.<br/>\n- Someone printed out and passed character sheets around so people can play the game immediately at the con which led to others buying the game. I have no idea where these sheets came from.<br/>\n- When you roll to act, everyone rolls at the same time, coupled with the game encouraging you to be loud... drew much attention.<br/>\n- People could keep playing their character game to game. Which encouraged more play, more attention.<br/>\n- People quickly started competing with each other to see who could survive the most planets!<br/>\n- The cover is beautiful!<br/>\n- Name is distinct and memorable. Plus love the wrestling tie in... Austin 3:16 says I just kicked your ass!<br/>\n- The Design Matters booth was very inviting and friendly. You got the feeling everyone was friends and having a good time rather than being desperate to sell games.<br/>\n- 3:16 was one of the few games that you communicate why it was awesome in seconds in a clear and truly enthusiastic manner!<br/>\n- Your level of investment in terms of tactical thinking or role playing your character is very flexible...<br/>\n- It's easy to GM. There is this planet. Go there. Blow shit up. Don't come back till you blow stuff up. You get there. Shit attacks you. What do you do?<br/>\n- I don't remember what it cost but it was very reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there is much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you agree with the above?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you think it was successful?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will likely create <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7353" rel="nofollow">mini case studies of games success to include in my Marketing "how to" documents at some point.</a> No promises.

There's a tendency to aim for a Gen Con release, but in our experience, releasing a game prior to the con (as we did with <em>Shab-al-Hiri Roach</em>) gives you a chance to build buzz with actual play, discussion, additional resources, etc.  It also allows time for reviewers to talk about the book to an eager throng of con-goers.  By the time you get to the convention, there are a lot more folks talking about the game than just the designer.  <br><br>I'd been reading about <em>3:16</em> around here in the months before the con, and I was really excited to try it out when we got to Indy.  After I bought it, I was so eager to play I could barely finish reading it.  Big thanks to John for taking in so many worthless pukes like myself and turning them into hardened troopers!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164085/#Comment_164085" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T10:57:23+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 10:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe John was making copies of character sheets from book, if I understand correctly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164090/#Comment_164090" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T11:05:26+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 11:05AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next time I write a marketing plan, I'm going to write "John Harper" all over it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164094/#Comment_164094" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T11:13:08+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 11:13AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I found Robin in the trade hall and gave him a free copy of 3:16.

If you remove all the other good stuff on jenskot's list, John alone still accounts for a big indie hit. He fucking rocked it.<br/><br/><br/>And, the other thing: 3:16 fulfills market problems or needs, as follows: <br/><br/>1) It is not too fucking serious or emo or whatever. It's just fun. People want this. <br/>2) It does not require a massive, massive investment of time and commitment. It "fits" our maturing and ever-busy lifestyles. <br/>3) It is an EASY sell back home for people struggling with their game groups and the indie Kool-Aid. "Well, I tried to get my group to play Grey Ranks, but they weren't into it. They're going to LOVE 3:16!"<br/><br/>These issues didn't talked about much as far as I could tell. But, I'll be damned if I didn't see people recognizing this without even thinking twice. It's like they <i>intuited</i> that the game solved a lot of their social and lifestyle hurdles to gaming back home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164189/#Comment_164189" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:44:03+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 2:05PM by Double King.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>First, it's an easy game to get your head around from both a player and ref perspective.  It will be the first thing i run from my GenCon haul because the others are still digesting.<br/><br/>It was inexpensive enough to pick up on the fly and take a risk on it.  I went to the con with a shopping list.  I found myself returning to NYC with a handful of additional books that were impulse buys.  And all of that stuff stacks up cash wise.  I would have very much liked to pick up Clint and Amy's game but $40 was too much in addition to a bunch of other $20ish dollar books. (did i mention how great i thought Clint and Amy are?  i'm still kicking myself over that decision.)<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that Gregor could sell vegan condoms to omivorous Catholics based on his salesmanship and winsome way.  However, I'd made my purchases on Saturday afternoon <b>before</b> i'd had a chance to have a drink with him and the other DM folk.   <br/><br/>It definitely mattered that i'd heard about it a bit either here or at the Forge in the month or so before going.  I didn't follow it, but knew that it was ascendant.  <br/><br/>The main reason i picked it up was that Matt Wilson wouldn't shut up about how much fun it was.  I can't tell you how many sales the IPR booth made on 3:16 based on Matt running the register just after having played it.  I didn't check the final IPR numbers but i think it's safe to say that 3:16 and Zombie Cinema were the run away hits that weren't Evil Hat products (SotC and Don't Rest Your Head sold steadily).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164190/#Comment_164190" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:44:58+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh, and i love the idea of case studies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164197/#Comment_164197" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:58:09+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:58PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3:16 is just so fun, I was practically <i>compelled</i> to spread the word and run it non-stop at the show.<br/><br/>Much credit goes to Ben Robbins for getting the PDF at launch, digesting it, and running it immediately for me (twice) at GoPlayNW Jr..

Problem is, I knew I probably wouldn't end up playing either of them. In the end, I picked up 3:16 and not EoD on the force of price point alone.

It was so seductive and compelling.  Space Opera + FATE + phone book scale = x.  At $60 you got the softcover, the pdf and a promise for a hardcover.

I'm sure it was intentional but its sort of bathroom reading / koan format made me feel that the content was lighter than it probably was in actuality.<br/><br/>the most surprising purchase for me with regard to the above was that i walked away with Contenders because i kept getting caught on the mechanics of it all and i wanted to figure out how it all worked.  perhaps that's the magic of page design but it's the same thing that should have grabbed me in other examples which didn't.<br/><br/>mind you i'm a bit of a packaging whore and do my alpha consumption with aesthetics in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164393/#Comment_164393" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T09:32:39+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  9:32AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Much credit goes to Ben Robbins for getting the PDF at launch, digesting it, and running it immediately for me (twice) at GoPlayNW Jr..

Actually, I can't think of a better album that fits the theme of 3:16 than Those Once Loyal - Bolt Thrower's latest and final album (really the best they've ever done)\n<blockquote><p>I managed to resist including either Yes's "Starship Trooper" or Sarah Brightman's "I Fell In Love with a Starship Trooper."</p></blockquote>\nThank you for resisting! ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164576/#Comment_164576" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T07:45:52+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  7:45AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, Bolt Thrower. That takes me back to my youth!<br/><br/>Early Metallica and soundtracks like Predator, Aliens, Starship Troopers and Judge Dredd probably do it for me.<br/><br/>I think it's sugary-sweet theme and easy buy-in really helped it get looked at. I think the game kept up its end of the bargain and converted the looks into sales. And I'm really hopeful that the sales are going to turn into play. That seemed a big concern for people this year -- that they were going to actually play what they were buying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164578/#Comment_164578" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T08:25:26+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  8:25AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I remember correctly Bolt Thrower have been connected to WH40K forever, so... well, we're coming full circle <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164602/#Comment_164602" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T11:58:50+00:00" title="August 23, 2008 11:58AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>If I remember correctly Bolt Thrower have been connected to WH40K forever, so... well, we're coming full circle <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI want to talk about music for this game so I'm'a bust out a new thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164609/#Comment_164609" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T13:11:03+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  1:11PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: edheil</cite>I managed to resist including either Yes's "Starship Trooper"</blockquote>\n"Starship Trooper" is great!
