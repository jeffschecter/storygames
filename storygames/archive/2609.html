I'm working on some "Emotional Burnout" rules based on a really cool discussion our group had after our game, that's essentially an optional rule where you detail what you believe your overall burnout is based on your experiences in the town are (as our group has a tendency to leave a trail of bodies or burned buildings in our Dogs games, and we had to just think about how hellish this is to do again and again).  Such as idea would lend itself well to Dark Side traits.<br/><br/><i>My Life with Master</i>...*ahem*...the Dark Lord of the Sith.  Shoot, even My Life with an Uncompromising Jedi Master.  Either way, I could see both apprentices and droids involved.  Or even the folks in the Millennium Falcon while Obi-Wan was on board.<br/><br/>Any other thoughts out there?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60018/#Comment_60018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T17:27:16+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  5:27PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2007 5:27PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Spirit of the Century</i>, for obvious reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60021/#Comment_60021" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T18:20:29+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  6:20PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought Polaris <em>was</em> about Jedi in the last days of the Republic... <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60029/#Comment_60029" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-08T19:30:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2007  7:30PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A recent thread on RPG.net suggested that many RPGs are put to the Star Wars test - Can this game run Star Wars?<br/><br/>My intuition is that it's easier to make a list of games that could not run Star Wars than those that could.

I'm working on some "Emotional Burnout" rules based on a really cool discussion our group had after our game, that's essentially an optional rule where you detail what you believe your overall burnout is based on your experiences in the town are (as our group has a tendency to leave a trail of bodies or burned buildings in our Dogs games, and we had to just think about how hellish this is to do again and again).  Such as idea would lend itself well to Dark Side traits.</blockquote>\nI'm currently running a "Jedi in the Vineyard" game, and it works pretty well. There's not nearly as much death and destruction as I'd like, though... the PC Jedis are more likely to talk things out and mediate than get medieval with a lightsaber. I keep pushing them by having NPCs Escalating, but their Raises and Sees are in the form of disarming folk or non-violent Force use.

You would write down things you did or saw that horrified you, and assign some sort of dice rating based one something I haven't thought of yet.  For example:<br/><br/>"We decimated nearly every woman in this town the ones leading the sewing circle were sorceresses.  3d8<br/>I watched my friend kill a child possessed by a demon. 2d6"<br/><br/>The dice are rolled like in Fallout, only traits gained in the "short term" are for the next town only, and "long term" means permanent.<br/><br/>The idea behind this was that there were scenes where the GM in our last Dogs game said Yes, rather than roll the dice, when we said we were going to start killing everyone in the sewing circle and anyone who stood in our way.  This was at the very end of the game, after we rooted out evil, killed demons &amp; sorceresses, etc.  After the game was over, each of us players looked at one another and basically went "What the hell did we just do?"  We sat around for another hour and talked about the idea of Dogs burning out and leaving the life for any number of reasons, and I thought that some sort of journal-like mechanic for tracking "why" and "what happens" would be interesting.<br/><br/>Say you go into another town and watch another child be killed because he's possessed.  Is that still just 2d6?  Maybe you don't feel it as much, so it's 1d6 (if you list it at all)?  Or maybe it's <i>worse</i> now, and this time you jot down 3d6?  The idea that it's player-driven means that they can list as much as they want and put the meaning down for them.  The fact that it's optional -- you don't have to note down anything like that even if others are -- means (hopefully) it'll be used for great awesome, not just because it has to be used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60541/#Comment_60541" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T08:19:56+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  8:19AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of my goal with Sufficiently Advanced was to make it impossible to run Star Wars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
