The matrix as a whole is a living creature capable of responding to stimulus and possibly even sentience. The clay flats are home to some rather bizarre thermal/chemical reactions that help make the planet a good environment for clay. There are also highly valuable organic molecules buried in the clay. The energy input is photosynthesis, through symbiotic chlorophyll-bearing organisms embedded in the clay. On the boundary between regions, there's a turbulent zone where the two clay organisms cannibalize each other for genetic material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169402/#Comment_169402" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T09:03:02+00:00" title="September 16, 2008  9:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2008 9:09AM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ringworlds, dyson spheres, and... whatever the tubes are (edit: topopolis, or "cosmic spaghetti"), I love those.

Heated by possible radioactive decay at the core plus tidal forces from the gas giant it circles (Jupiter in this case). Lower gravity means pressure doesn't build up as fast  with depth as it does on Earth. I *think* the ratio would be directly proportional to the gravity. On Earth, water pressure increases by 1 atmosphere about every 10 meters (9.8 for salt water). On Europa with a surface gravity of .135 of Earth that should mean the pressure builds up about 1 atmosphere for every 74 meters depth. Marine animals and submarines would use fins more for vertical maneuvering than swim bladders or ballast on/in Europa than in Earth's oceans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169411/#Comment_169411" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-16T09:32:18+00:00" title="September 16, 2008  9:32AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2008 9:35AM by John_Powell.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dyson also wrote of genetically modifying trees to grow habitats on comets.

In such a case, the day/night cycle can actually be based off the position of the gas giant in the sky, and the sun would merely be the equivalent of Earth's moon, visually.<br/><br/>As for the walking cities on Mercury, check out Blue Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson.  There's a city that actually rides on rails that circle the entire planet.  As the one side of the planet moves into the sun, the rails heat and expand, pushing the city further along into the dark side (where the rails are cold and thus smaller).  This keeps the city forever within the planet's terminator, and the friction also becomes a never-ending source of energy.<br/><br/>Tulpa, I recently read that book.  You've got it pretty much correct.  Additionally, once every seven (IIRC) years or so, certain plants mature and oxygen levels and so on hit a peak, resulting in a veritable firestorm, rather than the normal, relatively placid brush fire.<br/><br/>Other creative pseudoscience sci-fi stuff:<br/><br/>From Hyperion, by Dan Simmons, come the Treeships.  Quoth wikipedia:<br/>"Treeships are living trees that are propelled by ergs (an alien being that emits force fields) through space. The ergs also generate the containment fields (force fields) around the tree that keep its atmosphere intact. There are only a small number of Treeships in existence."  If you're looking for a cool Spelljammer-esque ship, this would most certainly fit the bill.  Alternatively, could be large enough to be a small "planet" in and of itself.<br/><br/>Various books in Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space universe include reference to the Jugglers, a microbial life form that is found on many different ocean worlds, and no one knows quite how they got there.  What's interesting about them is that those who go swimming in the water often have their brains' reconfigured by the Jugglers, imparting (permanently or impermanently) things like heightened senses, or increased mathematical understanding, etc.<br/><br/>Dyson spheres, ringworlds, and hollowed-out asteroids are all fairly common sci-fi tropes, as have already been mentioned.  Hrm.  How about a completely rogue planet, having been knocked out of it's original orbit, and slowly making it's way through dead space?  Would be completely frozen (read:solid hydrogen ice and such) and even it's geothermic and tectonic activity would have stopped, due to the lack of tidal forces and so on (depends on how long it's been rogue).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177928/#Comment_177928" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-09T23:24:31+00:00" title="November  9, 2008 11:24PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert L.

The first one, <i>Sun of Suns</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_of_Suns" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_of_Suns</a>) is an excellent swashbuckling story as well as an incredible source for alternate life environments.  Virga is a massive hollow sphere filled with air and heated internally with fusion-based suns.  The interior of the sphere is covered in glaciers formed by cooling water vapor that reaches the edge.  <br/><br/>Societies use asteroid-type clods of dirt to live on, and have created any number of other contraptions to create centrifugal gravity.  One interesting note: Servant-class folks in the more imperial societies are kept in zero-g conditions so their physiologies become fragile and they're easier to control.<br/><br/>Also, the new Culture book from Iain M. Banks, <i>Matter</i> contains a multi-leveled Dyson sphere, and explores the various strange properties thereof, along with a similar megastructure created by a water-dwelling race called a Nest, which is a massive clump of rotating, twisting, braided water tubes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178168/#Comment_178168" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T08:35:58+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  8:35AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>For starters, with that huge temperature differential, you might get all sorts of weird weather patterns, winds, storms, etc--and the atmosphere itself could store up energy, like static electricity in a giant capacitor.

The air gets heated at that pole, runs back to the terminator and starts to fall/cool, whereupon it would fall to the ground and start rushing back to fill the void made by the superheated air.  The dark side could, with a thick-enough atmosphere, stay warm by simple heat transfer and convection.  <br/><br/>There's a gas giant ... 2007 TrES-4 ... that's much larger than Jupiter and orbits incredibly close to it's primary.  It'd be like this, only as a gas giant.<br/><br/>As for the heat-pump creature, you wouldn't need a tidal lock to use this method, but with constant sunlight, you could have a creature that has a large organ that absorbs heat at one end and has the other buried in the ground.  The temperature differential provides convective circulation around a sort of hollow cylinder with a tube up the middle - it's hard to describe.  Anyways - line the inside with cilia attached at the other end to a sort of flagella-in-reverse.  When the cilia moves, it moves the root around inside a bioelectric jar, creating a current.  By Brownian Motion alone from the fluid, you'd have a constant supply of electrical current for running processes.<br/><br/>This could be modified by the creature's biology by peristaltic stops to the flow, creating more turbulence in the fluid.  Add in little things like blood cells floating around and you get all sorts of motion.<br/><br/>But really, with constant sunshine, just go for the photosynthesis.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178187/#Comment_178187" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T12:00:19+00:00" title="November 11, 2008 12:00PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>It'd have to be a long creature.</blockquote>I can't recall the short story that gave me the idea, but that's sort of what it's about--long, ridge-like creatures who use temperature flux from one side of their bodies to the other for metabolism.

You lose a lot of tensile strength, when you go to a ring from a sphere (but you avoid sheering forces, so that might be a "wash," depending on the base material from which they're constructed).<br/><br/>But their main problem is detectability, as compared to a sphere. At least one solution/explanation of the Fermi Paradox makes it VERY important that one become unnoticeable to the universe as a whole. A ring world screams "high tech over HERE!" while a Dyson sphere is going to look like some kind of dead star, if it is detected at all (gravity detection, lensing).<br/><br/>And efficiency--you're only capturing a minuscule fraction of emitted radiation. And space to build--GOD, there's a lot of space on a Dyson sphere. A LOT, times two (inner and outer surfaces).<br/><br/>But that said... both are impossible without some serious pseudo-science and/or materials with properties we've yet to imagine.<br/>----<br/>Yes, Matter was good. It wasn't Use of Weapons (his absolute best) or Consider Phlebus (his funniest so far), but a solid turn-out. I'd take a "lesser" Banks novel over the top work of 99% of current authors any day.<br/>----<br/>I recalled another one while writing this--did someone above say Smoke Ring? Somehow, a deep, thick atmosphere is held in a stable orbit around a sun, and life (and civilization) arises in a habitable band in the zero-gravity world where even huge beings (relative to Earth gravity) can fly like hummingbirds.<br/><br/>One could have a lot of fun with a planet that's in a shared orbit between two binaries, where it periodically leaves one star for the other one, when tides are right. The transfer would be much colder, and perhaps the planet has three different ecologies, each one specialized for either a particular sun or the colder stretch during a switch-over. Basically, imagine a figure eight orbit, with the crossed lines being at a remove from both suns (i.e. the "shared aphelion" of the planet's orbit around each sun--Deep Winter).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178203/#Comment_178203" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T12:55:40+00:00" title="November 11, 2008 12:55PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2008 12:58PM by MikeRiverso.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>What about a planet that goes through a periodic planet-wide environmental fluctuation?<br/><br/>A mars-like world with a surprising amount of ice buried not far beneath the crust.

The wobble would have to be huge to in order to cause such a massive change in temperature.  You could easily have the planet in a pronounced elliptical, like many comets and such, which would take it close to the sun for a short period of time, and then away from the sun for the majority of its year.  This would result in a short but hot summer, and a long, extremely cold winter.<br/><br/>Another option would be a moon in a very slow orbit around a gas giant.  If it's not tidally locked, it could have a normal day/night cycle in reference to the sun, most of time, but there would be long stretches of time where it would be within the gas giant's umbra, thus having absolutely no sunlight.  In fact, the seasons of this planet could be determined by its position around the gas giant (sun, umbra, or penumbra), rather than caused by its axial tilt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
