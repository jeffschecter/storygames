I need an Oracle to help me swim forever, and make it possible to push others into the pool.  I'm going to have a real, regular group again in a few weeks, so I want to get this right.  <br/><br/>Reading over at the forge about Oracle Creation, I went back to this: <blockquote><cite>Vincent Baker said:</cite>My guideline was: in each oracle, enough stuff specific to that oracle (so like, enough ghosts in the Unquiet Past, enough soldiers in God-kings of War) plus enough normal stuff for the ghosts and soldiers to interact with. Otherwise the Unquiet Past is all ghosts interacting with one another, with no merchants' sons or whomever to get caught up in it.</blockquote>\nI've got a bunch of really fancy reflective card protectors, in different colors.  I'm going to take each major theme I want to explore, and give it a color.  But instead of including some normal elements to balance it out, I'll have one color reserved for the normal elements.  So when you choose the oracle, you choose which colors to draw.  <br/><br/>Examples:  <br/>"I want all soldiers and blood warriors!  Let's draw all RED." <br/>"I want to see our Strange Journeys clash with the Ruins and some regular folk caught up in it, or something, so let's do 1 Gold, 1 Blue, and two black."<br/>"I want urban intrigue.  Let's grab 2 purple and 2 black."<br/><br/>So I know how to structure it, and I know how to write individual Oracle elements.  So the big question has been: What fiction elements do I want to see in my ideal game?  <br/><br/>I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to answer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135393/#Comment_135393" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T10:58:22+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 10:58AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (ctd from 1st post)<br/><br/>Here's me thinking:<br/><br/>I love personal stories about honor, fraternity, and duty.  I'm also big on battle scenes, and the choices faced by soldiers during war.  So theme 1 is about soldiers.  God-Kings of War can be adapted for this purpose.  The color for this is Red.  <br/><br/>I love distant, mythical journeys, especially ones with a strong sense of wonder.  Seven voyages of Sinbad, the Odyssey, and Gilgamesh fit in there, but so does the Far Kingdoms and the Magic Three of Solatia (both obscure, I know).  Even Candide and Gulliver's Travels fit somewhat.  <br/><br/>I love origin or creation stories (when the world was young...) where the gods trick, kill, and so forth, and those actions leave a legacy (why does the gold poppy have 4 petals? let me tell you...)<br/><br/>I love meetings with or between characters whose lifespans span far greater than ours - the kinds of characters that can remember an ice age or a fallen kingdom.  I've got a real soft spot for ruins.<br/><br/>I like really dangerous monsters; I hate it when monsters become just another kind of local fauna.  That said, I don't mind bengal tigers as monsters, or fantastic fauna, but monsters have to represent great danger.  I want a monster to get players MOVING every time.<br/><br/>I like shamans and pacts made with spirits, and I like characters who have a great purpose or destiny (prophets, reincarnated heroes, and so forth). Also, I love the concept of sacred places in the natural world.  <br/><br/>I like characters running through alleyways and the sometimes-bloody jockeying of factions within a city (especially if the city is old!)  I like those stories traversing the ruins beneath the city and intersecting.<br/><br/>But most of all I love a sense of history (that's why IAWA is my favorite game in the first place).  I like jumping around in time, fleshing out the past and the future, the way past actions can have major ramifications in the present.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135395/#Comment_135395" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T11:03:08+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 11:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, a big question would be: How do I intend to use the same oracle for such different games?  <br/><br/>For IAWA I described the method, above.  <br/><br/>My unnamed game is about parties working together against common adversity.  For that we'd draw a much bigger oracle, maybe 8 cards, maybe 10.  From there, we'd weave stuff together, point Best Interests around as per IAWA, figure out who stood where, and then have the players choose a party concept that is vested in the conflict as shown.  In addition to that the GM can take a few extra cards, point best interests at the rest of the situation, and that's the additional secret stuff in the background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135397/#Comment_135397" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T11:30:35+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 11:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>I don't know if this will be helpful or not, but I'll just throw some stuff out there. In particular, I don't have much of an answer yet to your main question--what kinds of oracles to have--but I'll think on it and get back to you. At first glance it just looks to me like you should choose whatever you like most--an artistic/aesthetic choice rather than a design choice.<br/><br/>For the "parties working together against adversity", consider two things:<br/><br/>1. It might be better (maybe, maybe not) to create the party first, and then the setting/adversity. At least worth thinking about.<br/><br/>If not:<br/><br/>2. My "brainstorming map" method from Land of Nodd might suit you well here. You can use Oracle elements instead of player-created stuff, if you prefer. It's a good way to set up a web of factions ("The Orc horde, the Knights of Jerusalem, and the Merchants' Guild all want to retrieve the Idol from the Tomb of...") that you can then plug a "party" into ("Ok, how about we're a group of Knights of Jerusalem/how about we're mercenaries hired by the Merchants' Guild?").<br/><br/>It does the same thing as Vincent's Best Interests but in a different way, and provides more in terms of relationships between factions, whether god, bad, or neutral. IaWA is more about individuals and how they want to screw each other over.<br/><br/>(I've "playtested" that method just by myself, alone, and found it really fun and inspiring--I came up with all sorts of stuff I wouldn't have without the method, used it to design adventures, etc)<br/><br/>In general, if you want more of a fleshed-out world/adventure campaign sort of vibe, I would recommend you build more wide-scope elements (groups and political factions instead of individuals, etc) and include a clear way to establish the relationships between the elements (not just who wants what, but what their history might be, how they are positioned relative to each other geographically, etc). This is kind of out of date now (especially now that IaWA is out), but a long while back I wrote up something about creating RPG play from the Fantasy Oracle, which you can read <a href="http://www.fudgerpg.info/guide/bin/view/Projects/OldSchoolAdviceLight" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Maybe that will give you some ideas.<br/><br/>As for the card decks, are you planning to have the colors on the backs of the cards? It might be awkward if you can see which deck the cards come from when you're drawing them. Maybe the color should be on the face of the card (like Magic: the Gathering cards).<br/><br/>Cheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135399/#Comment_135399" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T11:39:34+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 11:39AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2008 11:41AM by Ry.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The colors definitely need to be on the card backs - Choosing what colors to use is exactly the same as choosing an oracle IAWA.

I like your break-down, it seems pretty complete (and strongly matches the concepts that I myself love in stories).  I would suggest that you always pull about 25% 'normal elements', unless you want a super-high-powered and super-focused setup:  Pulling all WHITE and SILVER would give you the Gods of the Ancient Days, before mortals were created, for example.  Not a bad thing, necessarily, but not exactly what you wanted, either.<br/><br/>If you really want to be able to 'swim forever' with this, there needs to be a way to rotate in new oracle elements.  This has been discussed in various threads, but my suggestion is to do this:<br/><br/>At the end of every session, every player makes up one new oracle entry, slated to eventually go into one of the oracles.  Whenever an oracle entry comes up for the third time at the start of a chapter, use it, then replace it with a random draw from the player-created entries for that oracle.  That way the oracles never get stale or repetitive, no matter how long you use them, even with the same group of players.<br/><br/>(And of course, this <i>needs</i> to go up on Abulafia when you're done. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135503/#Comment_135503" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T06:10:26+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  6:10AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DainXB</cite>If you really want to be able to 'swim forever' with this, there needs to be a way to rotate in new oracle elements.</blockquote>\nYes... I was thinking that you could 'retire' an element by making a map, picture, or dictionary entry for it.  So if we'd seen enough desert nomads hiding women, you could make an entry about the ones we saw in play and retire it that way.<br/><br/>For adding new ones, I have this idea that all the entries I'm proposing have to get past the group as a whole, and that any new additions have to be vetted by the group (everybody has veto power).  <br/><br/>It's not mechanical but it shares the same principle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135506/#Comment_135506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T06:16:01+00:00" title="March 19, 2008  6:16AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DainXB</cite>BLACK:  Ordinary Things</blockquote>I think I'd call this "All Too Human" or something just to sound cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135574/#Comment_135574" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-19T12:54:05+00:00" title="March 19, 2008 12:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "All Too Human" is perfect!
