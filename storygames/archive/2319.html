                    Yesterday we had the first full session of our <a href="http://wyrmwood.srgames.org/RPGs/24hour/Savagery.pdf" rel="nofollow">Savagery</a> playtest. It had two club scenes and three tigger scenes, one for each PC. As a warning, the context for the club and characters leans heavily into the new Doctor Who series, and even some of Torchwood. Specifically the club is a mirror of the Doctor Club in the 2nd season episode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_%26_Monsters" rel="nofollow">"Love and Monsters"</a>. Except we're in Cardiff, because of the events in that episode... <br/><br/>We've decided to play for an upward spiral, so things will generally get better for the characters. The PC club members are the following:<br/><br/>Kevin Lewellyn - Played by Zach<br/>Past: Always a "geeky" individual in school, Kevin could never really relate to people. <br/>Present: Working as a computer programmer with a large firm. He doesn't have any friends except for the club.<br/>Future: To open up and relate to people, and gain a position of authority.<br/>Ego 5<br/>Empathy 2 <br/>Ideals 5 (now 6)<br/>Libido 4 <br/>Reason 7<br/>Styles: Debater 3, Whiner 2<br/>Drives: To open up and relate to people, To obtain a position of authority, To get a girlfriend, and to leave his mark.<br/><br/><br/>Rivolyn Castine - Played by Lia<br/>Past: When she was growing up she always wanted to a martial artist.<br/>Present: She video tapes weddings and take professional pictures.<br/>Future: She wants to marry the Doctor.<br/>Ego 2<br/>Empathy 5 <br/>Ideals 6<br/>Libido 4 <br/>Reason 6<br/>Styles: Listener 2, Debator 2, Intimidator 1<br/>Drives: Love life, Martial Arts, Impress the Doctor, Investigate the unusual<br/><br/><br/>Arnie Kaufmann - Played by Mendel<br/>Past: He was always the biggest kid in his class. He protected the other kids, but couldn't protect his sister. <br/>Present: Arnie drives a cab and fixes his neighbors' cars on his days off.<br/>Future: Arnie wants to travel, but has never left Wales.<br/>Ego 3<br/>Empathy 6 <br/>Ideals 6 (now 7)<br/>Libido 4 <br/>Reason 6<br/>Styles: Stalwart 3, Whiner 2<br/>Drives: See the World, Run the Cab, Start Dating, Get his Masters, Befriend the Neighbors.<br/><br/><br/>The first club scene was an argument between Rivolyn and Arnie about where the club should take a field trip. Arnie wanted to go to Scotland, and Rivolyn to London as planned, before the disappearance of the London branch. As Arnie I stuck with Stalwart almost exclusively, guarding and alternating between Stifling Rivolyn's aggression and Brutalizing her ego. Rivolyn tried her different styles, but was laid low by two strong hits to her ego. This was an object lesson in "should have tapped out." <br/><br/>However, she came back strong in a Investigation trigger scene. She was being harrased by the library goon, Sean Flattery. She exploited her Lisener style and brutalized him to an Empathy loss, feeling alone and ignored, Sean wandered off, and Lia spent her two VP on buying back her lost Ego.<br/><br/>We followed that scene by another club scene, this time starting with a lecture on Nietzsche, given by Arnie. Kevin wanted to argue philosophy, even though he knew nothing about Nietzsche. Rivolyn, just wanted to shut us both up. As a result we had our first 3-way fight. Interestingly enough, the combat mechanics worked find - even though I hadn't considered that during design. The only rough spot was deciding if the fight ended when someone tapped out, as Kevin did when he took 8 damage to his vulnerable Empathy. We decided that the rules implies that the fight ended there, and awarded both Rivolyn and Arnie a VP, Arnie has two now. I definitely need to make things clearer on this.<br/><br/>Now Kevin had his trigger scene, with his boss Donovan, about getting more responsibility at work. Kevin took Donovon's attacks, and focused on grappling him into submission - using reason to overcome Donovan's ideals. This worked, although Kevin was one lucky hit away from losing on his own. As such, Donovan decided to let Kevin have a chance to prove to himself that he was a failure.<br/><br/>Since we were low on time we skipped the next club scene, although in the future I'd like to avoid that, as club scenes are a good way to get more VP spread around. Instead we had my Start Dating trigger scene, revolving around Shelly, my regular fare. Rolling her up she ended up with a hideous Ego (9), and other psyche ratings equalling Arnie's. It was going to be a tough fight. I set the scene up to be asking her on a date while driving her somewhere. And immediately spent the rest of the time backpedalling, and eventually guarding for my sanity. I ended up fleeing after some failed attempts to feint for some chance of affecting her, I couldn't afford the guilt of losing by knock-out. Deciding that I needed to go back after that Drive later, I decided to beef up my ideals, with the two VP I had from club scenes, improving my guard and stifle. It's a shame, I was really hoping to save up for more Fighting Styles...<br/><br/>As a playtest, this indicated some more care is needed with the end of a 3+ person fight, and suggested some possible balance issue to examine as far as the maneuvers. Although the later is hardly conclusive, Lia suggested that Counter was a little weak, but nearly any suggested improvement would make it too powerful. The core combat mechanics seem to be in a state of minor tweaking, rather than requiring any overhaul, but I'm holding out a final judgement until I see a few more games, and some more of the maneuvers in use. <br/><br/>Also, in a session or so we hope to try out a troupe style play - where each player has another player as the player of their NPCs - rather than using the Attack/Defend random NPCs in the present game. However, I haven't noticed a serious problem with those random NPCs yet.<br/><br/>Any suggestions or comments?<br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                </div>
