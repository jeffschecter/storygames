And related procedures that you find in GM-less games (or whatever you want to call them) where certain GM responsibilities are handled by the game rules or distributed to all players?<br/><br/>In <i>Shock:</i> and <i>Mars Colony</i> you play through a (mostly) set number of scenes and then see where you've gotten to at the end. You can still do whatever you want in those scenes, but you have to say up-front what you want to get out of them, and you roll your dice to resolve the scene as opposed to specific actions within it.<br/><br/>In <i>Burning Empires</i> there's a scene economy, you can only play a certain number of certain types of scenes before you have to roll to see which side of the war  is winning. There's different types of scenes, so if you used up all your opportunities to roll dice early, you have to wait while the other players get their spotlight time.<br/><br/>In <i>The Shab al-Hiri Roach</i> and <i>Grey Ranks</i> there is a sort-of "set list" of scenes you play through that follow a timeline and require certain elements, though there is lots of freedom beyond that (especially in the Roach). Both of these also feature dice for scene resolution, not task resolution.<br/><br/>In <i>Spione</i>, players all take turns framing scenes round-robin style, and you're encouraged to build towards "flashpoint" (a conflict or crisis) and then you go to cards to resolve the situation.<br/><br/>Um, there's the ritualized phrases in <i>Polaris</i>, too.<br/><br/>(caveat: I might not be accurately representing each of these games, with such abbreviated summaries.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313146/#Comment_313146" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T01:23:23+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  1:23AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/perfect/" rel="nofollow">Perfect, Unrevised</a> follows a strict set of procedures.

I played D&amp;D for decades, starting in 1980, without ever having a firm explicit grasp on its procedural cycles, until the old-school renaissance caused me to discover (I didn't play Moldvay Basic back in the day) and appreciate what they were and why they were awesome. Exposure to indie approaches, e.g. <i>Play Unsafe</i>, definitely helped me understand how going through a set of steps &amp; rolling dice for each one wasn't going to have to produce the meaningless &amp; dull wandering monster encounters that I heard badmouthed for most of my D&amp;D life - either because the people slagging these procedures hadn't really tried them for themselves (lots of key old-school ideas, like XP for gold, got similarly rejected out of hand without understanding what they were there to do), or because they'd experienced these procedures in the hands of a DM who wasn't good at/sympathetic to improv.<br/><br/> I think that D&amp;D lost sight of its procedures in part because of bloat - all the same systems are in the AD&amp;D DMG I grew up with, but they're hard to pick out from all the extra verbiage that's not in Basic D&amp;D. Also in part because D&amp;D increasingly started trying to become a go-anywhere, do-anything game of epic fantasy; the procedures in Moldvay or Legends &amp; Labyrinths work because they assume that dungeon- or hex-crawling to find treasure is going to be the activity of play you'll want to proceduralize (which isn't to say that other stuff won't happen, just that it's not assumed to need the same structure). <br/><br/>Note: I don't think anyone in the OSR knows what callers are for; I've had 15 players at the table for OD&amp;D and not felt like callers would be helpful. There might well be a wargaming situation they come from - maybe where one side has many sub-commanders and one person is in charge of gathering up all their orders and transmitting them to the referee - but I don't know about it if so. If David Wesely is at Gen Con again this year I'll ask him about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
