During the last months, though, i started following this (amazing) forum, and, now that my semester studyoing abroad is over, i collected some gamer friends, and finally had a go...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe chose to try out Psi-Run, cause it looked simple yet cool, and it was the one i figured i would have less trouble gm-ing, as my GM experience is very near to zero. The session was not very long, but funny: i wont' include a full AP here,  but we had a good afternoon... we still have to nail the feeling right, and  fully realize that the storytelling is much more shared (i found that some times i would narrate not only the player's failures, but also take over in narrating their successes, just because  we all had always been used to that... we started fixin' it pretty soon, though): sometimes the players would answer one of their questions in the simplest, and most down-to-earth way, without "daring" to say something about the setting and the outside world... As for myself, my inexperience was quite obvious when the group got stuck, running away but without particular goals, and we decided, as the got a 1 out a roll, to just have the chasers catch up on them to drive the story forward... i hope i learned the lesson, though... but everybody was happy with the game, and we agreed on playing again as soon as we get together. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this doesn't prompt to much discussion, but i was just kind of happy, and wanted to share it... if i were to ask a question, though, it would be: what is the first thing a player or GM used to 'normal' gaming, (say D&amp;D, Vampires, Exalted and the like) should do when approaching story games? what advices do you have?  which games, out of the big sea of the indie "scene", would you advise? they should be good for one-shots or short adventures, as i study in another city and only meet these friends in the weekends, and not even always... (our first tier was between IAWA, Psi-Run and Ghost/Echo, which i discarded because i'm quite inexpert as a narrator, and it requires an amount of improvisation i was not sure i could provide...)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: another funny fact was the ridiculous amount of unlucky rolls the guys had,  which led in veeeery short time to a lot of powers misfiring and people getting hurt... they all had at least one or two permanenet wounds each...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254216/#Comment_254216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T06:35:03+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  6:35AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had that "let's allow the chasers to catch up" thing happen in Psi Run too!<br/><br/>You will probably get a lot of different advice. My suggestion is to offer games that you, personally, love and are comfortable with. I don't think there is a huge gulf between one kind of game and another in terms of necessary skills, so if you are excited and they are intrigued and willing to give it a try, you should be good to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254217/#Comment_254217" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T06:35:49+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  6:35AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They chose to take permanent wounds over some other outcome. Psi-Run is one of my favorite games. Though it is sometimes hard with traditional gamers. My biggest advice would be to ask them in a scene "what would be the coolest thing that could happen now" then think to yourself how it would be if the different parts would change with failures and successes. If it becomes UN-fun without some part think about how that could be made fun. <br/><br/>I have never GMed Psi-Run, we always play cooperatively, but I can honestly say we have never had a stupid scene following this procedure. Play it to the hilt, be cinematic and get rid of the UN-fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254228/#Comment_254228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T08:01:31+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  8:01AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2010 8:03AM by Moreno R..">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albi_SG</cite><br/>I know this doesn't prompt to much discussion, but i was just kind of happy, and wanted to share it... if i were to ask a question, though, it would be: what is the first thing a player or GM used to 'normal' gaming, (say D&amp;D, Vampires, Exalted and the like) should do when approaching story games? what advices do you have?</blockquote>\nThe first one, and most important one, is FOLLOW THE RULES.  Read the game manual, and follow the procedures descripted on it. GM used to "traditional" roleplaying are used to consider the rules at most as "advice" or a nuisance, and change them at whim without even realizing it. It have talked to a lot of people who tried forge games who said that it was "playing as usual" and when I asked details, they admitted that they had changed "some rules" (usually 90% of them) even before starting to play. It's a really common mistake and people do it without even realizing it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albi_SG</cite>which games, out of the big sea of the indie "scene", would you advise?</blockquote>\nFor people who come from traditional roleplaying, I still think that nothing beat Dogs in the Vineyard as a "teaching text", because it's written for them. Another good one is the Solar System. For new players I would suggest Primetime Adventures, Spione or Trollbabe (the first two are already translated in Italian, the third will be in a few months)<br/><br/>If you want to meet other italian story-gamers or be informed of new translations or conventions in your area, I suggest you follow the forum <a href="www.gentechegioca.it" rel="nofollow">www.gentechegioca.it</a> , too                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254244/#Comment_254244" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T09:46:02+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  9:46AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Super-dumb offtopic question: can I get Psi-Run online?

Other than that...I don't know, I'm sure you'll find your voice, so to speak.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend you try IaWA for a punchy one-session game (that can be played for many many sessions, if you want), if you get the chance. Just make sure you read the text well and stick to Vincent's advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis" title="RivoClavis"><img alt="RivoClavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RivoClavis">RivoClavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254268/#Comment_254268" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T10:38:20+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 10:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would recommend warming up your players with some simple exercises in narrating stuff.

That's a good start.<br/><br/>Don't turn your back on the games you like: Once you pick up and get used to other games, you can always come back to playing your standards, either as-is with some tips and tricks you picked up (scene framing, getting to the point, etc) or even hacking them a bit (I ran a campaign about a year ago of Legend of the Five Rings, and hacked the rules to have things like Fan Mail (from Primetime Adventures) in them).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albi_SG</cite>which games, out of the big sea of the indie "scene", would you advise?</blockquote>\nWhat kinds of games do you like now? If I know a little I might be able to rec a game or two.<br/><br/>My favorites are Primetime Adventures and Dust Devils and With Great Power, but after that the waters get muddy (I like "Adventure Games" a lot, so I tend to aim more towards games with adventure themes).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
