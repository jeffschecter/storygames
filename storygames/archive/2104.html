<p>Over in the various threads on games marketed to the mainstream (or, at least, not to core roleplayers,) people tossed around a couple ideas about what might be appealing to folks who weren't RPG nerds. Playsheets that act almost like a boardgame, near-zero prep time, shorter playtime goal, the ability to play when the mood strikes, basic rules that could be placed on a single sheet, easy to acquire game components... things like that. I've been mulling over some of those ideas, since some of them are appealing to me whether or not we're worried about attracting mainstream people into the hobby.</p>
<p>Here is something I've come up with as a basic resolution system with rudimentary suggestions on character setup. I'm tossing it out here in case anyone else would like to use it; I'd certainly like to develop it more for use as a core system (similar to the way BRP is used in several games.) Also, I'd like some help tracking down possible related systems. I'll come back to that in a bit. My design assumptions here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic character creation is kept extremely simple, with characters fleshed out in play;</li>
<li>there will be additional rules for specific games/settings to limit or elaborate characters, situations, movement from scene to scene, and rewards;</li>
<li>game components are restricted to the commonest, easiest-to-get items possible;</li>
<li>the basic rules should be explainable in a couple sentences, with nuances explained later during play.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm temporarily calling this system "Common Sense", although I've played with other names and I'm open to suggestions.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Basic Character Creation</em><br/>
Pick a background, basically a profession or culture, and modify it with an adjective, to distinguish your character from others of the same type. Examples: "moody assassin", "gregarious vampire", "deranged monk". Pick one unusual talent and one major possession; the possession will have a numeric rating of 3. Specific settings will have limits or additional details on these three character components, or may describe additional necessary components like relationships.</p>
<p><em>Basic Resolution</em><br/>
If what the character wants to do is possible for that character, decide whether it's an attempt to create a temporary situational advantage or it's an attempt to make a significant change, then do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toss three coins and count the heads;</li>
<li>Compare that value to any blocking value (either a coin toss by an opponent, or a pre-existing defense or situation;) </li>
<li>If the value is higher than the defense, the action was effective. If the goal was to create an advantage, it's created with the value from the coin toss; if the goal was to make a significant change, the character achieves one-third of the desired goal (for example, if attacking to kill, the steps are "wounded"/"badly wounded"/"dying".)</li>
<li>Any other participants in the current scene get a chance to toss coins; they can block a previous toss, loan heads to another participant (and describe how their actions help the other character,) or try something unrelated to preceding actions;</li>
<li>After every participant has had a chance to toss, you can use a talent to re-toss one coin, adding its value to the results already achieved. This may be necessary to overcome a significant defense.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Boosting and Risking</em><br/>
Players only toss three coins at a time and can only re-toss up to three coins before another participant in the scene gets a chance. To be able to do more on your turn, you can risk something to toss two extra coins. If you toss five coins and get three tails, however, you lose what you risked. Players can also risk a major possession or situational advantage (anything with a numeric rating) to get extra coins (or re-toss existing coins) equal to the numeric value; if the player gets a number of tails equal to the numeric value of the possession or advantage minus 1, that possession or advantage is lost, although the player can attempt to regain it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There's a couple other elaborations you could do, but they should be fairly obvious: splitting results for multiple actions, splitting simultaneous attack and defense results, doing a coin toss to acquire equipment, and so on.</p>
<p>Any comments?</p>

<p>Here's what I'm thinking: I only remember reading about two other coin-based systems, but don't remember the details. Vincent had something, an alternate approach to <strong>DitV</strong>-style resolution, but I don't remember anything about it. I don't think it was similar to this at all. I think the other coin-based system was in <strong>Prince Valiant</strong>, but I'm not sure. It may have been closer to what I've described, though, so I would like to list it as a possible ancestor of this system, if anyone can tell me what the system was...</p>
<p>I didn't discuss using a "board" for this style of game, because the method would be specific to the setting, but I have been playing around with rolling dice on maps or playsheets and using where they land to determine results. It would work much the same here: you may have a playsheet divided into four quadrants with descriptors listed in each quadrant; at specific moments of the game, you would toss the coins on the playsheet instead of the table and change events in the fiction depending on where the coins fell.</p>

                            You may be thinking of Vincent's walk-around-the-neighborhood game, <a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/tnaplay.html" rel="nofollow"><i>The Nighttime Animals Save the World</i></a> which has a really clever coin mechanic.<br/><br/>I like the look of what you have here so far.

                            I like this. Can I split hairs?
<blockquote>Pick one unusual talent and one major possession; the possession will have a numeric rating of 3. </blockquote>
Is one talent too little? I realise you're trying to keep things simple, but, in most conflicts, it'd only give me one option.<br/><br/>I once played a hastily convened Cthulhu game in which the GM, Steve, told us to "choose two things we were good at and one thing we were bad at". I'd suggest two Talents and, well, perhaps one Disadvantage, but would require a mechanics thing to deal with it.
<blockquote>Toss three coins and count the heads</blockquote>
How about doing all the coins simultaneously: three players toss a coin each? I know it's a minor change, but it'd make the game flow more smoothly, and get everyone involved.
<blockquote>Compare that value to any blocking value (either a coin toss by an opponent, or a pre-existing defense or situation;). If the value is higher than the defense, the action was effective.</blockquote>
When you say the value, do you mean the number of heads, or the number of heads minus the number of tails? Usually it's the same, but if people are loaning heads (as below), it might make a difference.
<blockquote>If the goal was to create an advantage, it's created with the value from the coin toss; if the goal was to make a significant change, the character achieves one-third of the desired goal (for example, if attacking to kill, the steps are "wounded"/"badly wounded"/"dying".)</blockquote>
I'm not sure about this. It seems rather counter-intuitive. If, say, a significant change was "Open the vault", it'd be hard to divide it into three parts. But perhaps that's an advantage. In any case, that idea of dividing the goal into thirds seems a little difficult.<br/><br/>It's interesting stuff. By the way, if we start talking about The Nighttime Animals Save The World, I've got things to say about that too. It's a fascinating mechanic.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>I agree with the first part, but not the second. Coming up with a clear description of what the system is <em>for</em> as opposed to what it <em>does</em> will be a challenge, but I don't think most people will put up with baroque, clunky systems. There are even some roleplayers who won't put up with them.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen <strong>The Nighttime Animals Save The World</strong> before today, although I'd heard the name before, so that's not the coins system I was thinking of; rather, I remember Vincent doing something for one of his coming-of-age fantasy games that is on the back burner.</p>
<p>Graham:</p>
<p>I should probably start out by saying that I consider this presentation of the rules to be the "demo system", which would need to have expanded character creation rules, among other things, before it could be used for a specific setting. So, for example, I only picked one of each type of character trait (background, talent, possession) for the demo, to demonstrate how each is used, but a specific game might allow more talents or have an expanded background system.) Likewise, whether all participants toss their coins at the same time or not will depend on the needs of the specific game.</p>
<p>I do need to clarify some things, though. Step 1 for the basic resolution should probably say "Toss three coins and count the heads; this value is how effective your action is." So, everywhere I talk about comparing values, I mean the number of heads only, not the number of heads minus the number of tails. Tails are ignored, except when risking something, in which case the tails are counted up separately to determine whether you lose what you risk. This means you can win a contest but lose something at the same time.</p>
<p>I may need to change the rules for risking a possesion, though, to the number of coins flipped minus 2, to make it similar to the boosting rule.</p>
<p>I should also clairify that each participant tosses three coins. Three people tossing one coin each isn't going to work, because what if there are only two players? I toss three coins and count my heads, you toss three coins and count your heads. Depending on the specific game we're playing, we might be tossing simultaneously, or might not, but we're each getting a result from +0 to +3 (or +0 to +5, for a boosted toss.)</p>

<p>Should you be tossing coins for this at all? I should perhaps make this clearer; I was trying to be abbreviated. I see three possible consequences from opening the vault, which would be tested in three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's open instead of closed. Don't test, it's just open now.</li>
<li>It allows something to get in/out that you can use for another purpose. This is a situational advantage, so you toss coins to find out how effective it is.</li>
<li>It's something you're trying to finish before your opponents finish their own goals. This is a significant change, so you toss coins to see if you can open the vault before the vault floods/the ghost kills you/the dynamite explodes. The three stages are barely started, nearly open, fully open.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should add the three generalized stages of barely started, nearly finished, and finished to any final document, with examples of alternate wording, but I should also explain the differences between minor changes, situational advantages, and major changes as well.</p>

<p>Additional comment: I read a brief description of the Prince Valiant resolution system and the basics of it are very similar. You count heads in both systems. The differences are that the "Common Sense System" doesn't tie the number of coins to an attribute or skill rating and doesn't use the extended conflict system, where two players toss coins and take away coins from each other's "coin pools" until one person is eliminated. Also, boosting, reflipping, and splitting results provide a slightly different feel.</p>

                            Another game with a coin-flip mechanic is Underworld, which uses varying numbers of coins for standard actions, but always three coins for "mass" combat. Each of the three had to be a different coin, because each one represented something specific. You could use abilities or circumstances to flip a coin from tails to heads, and your opposition did the reverse. Depending on which coins came up which way, you had different types of favorable or unfavorable outcomes. Just throwing that out there.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Personally, if you want a mechanic that is simple and promotes good story telling is "...In spaaace!" face to face its a fun little game!<br/>
http://www.gregstolze.com/inSpaaace.zip<br/>
  Although, you might want to use an "effort" based system like Marvel Universe.<br/>
<br/>
  The idea being that the players have tokens that mean something. In this case it means drama control/story authority. Much like Once Upon A Time, it draws attention to the actual activity, but does not take attention away from the human interaction with the other players.<br/>
  Well, that is my thoughts, good luck!<br/>

<p>Colin:</p>
<p>It sounds like Underworld's mechanic does not involve counting heads, but consulting tables. Is this correct?</p>
<p>Dave:</p>
<p>I'm actually not thinking in terms of a game focused on drama control/story authority. Instead, I'm aiming for a system that adjusts pacing for achieving goals and which introduces unexpected details into events. The Token Effort system doesn't seem to do that. Thanks, anyways.</p>
