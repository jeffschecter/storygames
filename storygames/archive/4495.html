They will be linked by some kind of plot, leading to a revealing (if there is a mistery) and/or to a climatic end battle (if there is a BBEG).<br/><br/>So, for example:<br/><br/>1 - The party meets in a tavern (well, duh)<br/>2 - A mysterious stranger hands them the hook for the adventure<br/>3 - Following the hints, the party will (not always in this order):\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate about the seneshal daughter's secret love affair<br/> </li><li>Discover a secret chaos cult lead by the secret lover<br/> </li><li>Do something about the cult, generally leading, whatever they do, to...<br/> </li><li>Having a showdown in the secret cult temple<br/> </li><li>See the Cult Leader escape through a secret passage.<br/></li></ul>\n4 - Having blocked the evil cult, they will receive honor (or scorn, if there is some deep misunderstanding).<br/>5 - they will be ambushed by the cult leader and his top minions/beasties<br/>6 - Showdown!<br/><br/>What matters to this discussion is that typically all of these points will require a slew of npc concept writing, npc statting, creature planning, maybe location mapping and treasure placing (if relevant to the game at hand), and so on. So, the plot WILL revolve around discovering the cult, and dealing with it. Otherwise, all your work will be wasted.<br/><br/>Some GMs are very good at improvising stats and stuff, and just roll with it. <br/>Some GMs are not that good at it, or use a system working actively against it (on the fly statting a high level d20 character, yeah, right), or are simply very attached to their plot and WANT to use it.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that many players find playing inside someone else's plot as featured characters is not only desirable, but THE way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101784/#Comment_101784" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T01:26:48+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>In my experience, this means something like, "The player characters are audience-or-extras to a play put on by GM characters."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101786/#Comment_101786" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T01:44:28+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:44AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience is very close to Renato's.  The GM starts with a skeleton of a story: a general idea of what kinds of things will happen, who the major NPCs are and what they want, maybe a few "set pieces" (scenes/locations/events to put into the game at appropriate moments).  Things get tweaked to fit in better with what the players and/or their PCs want to do, and to anticipate the most likely actions they're going to take.<br/><br/>During play, the GM is the final arbiter of what's significant to the plot and what isn't: the players say what they want their PCs to attempt and float their own theories about what's going on, but what happens in the game world as a result of those actions/theories is the main way for the GM to keep the plot moving.  Information, allies, opponents, and setbacks will be strewn in the path of the PCs by the GM, typically in a way which is both entertaining and gets the game closer to a final conclusion.  And part of the "entertaining" half of that involves getting the players invested in what happens next and have their PCs actively pursue interesting goals (of which the results are, again, largely provided by the GM).  Sometimes during the course of the game the GM feels compelled to abandon, rewrite, or otherwise reconfigure the plot-as-written in order to better accomplish the goal of being entertaining for everyone.  Sometimes the players feel compelled to abandon, rewrite, or otherwise adjust their characters in order to better fit the plot the GM has prepared, so that the game is more entertaining for everyone.<br/><br/><br/>(I've been in a few games that were like Shreyas's description, and they sucked, but thankfully those experiences were few and far between.

Sometimes they would have some sort of "town bit" before the dungeon (this was an innovation for me and my teenage friends), sometimes not. What 'writing the plot' meant for these games was drawing a huge and complex map of the dungeon, with page and pages of detailed notes on what was in each room, traps, monsters, treasure and the like, with a brief paragraph somewhere on what the whole thing was 'about'<br/><br/>A little later I started to elaborate these with notes that were based on my expectations of player action. So I might write "This room contains two sleeping orcs, unless the PCs set off the alarm in room 11, in which case five or six orcs are getting ready for battle, putting on armour and the like". Previously I might have done that on the fly ... or not.<br/><br/>Over time this evolved into less specified sorts of dungeons, things where I drew the map but then wrote that there were ten monsters living here, rather than specifing where they were exactly.<br/><br/>As I moved away from linear dungeon adventures I stuck with this concept of lots of detail. I would now describe various locations and encounters with a paragraph or two each, which still added up to many pages per adventure. There would be an opening scene and then many optional scenes (as above, in no particular order), depending on player choice, sort of like a choose your own adventure book. So I would write things like "If the players choose to investigate the old pier they will find many crumbling buildings and abandoned concession stalls. In the last is, at night, a squamous fish man ...". This style, of course, was very much influenced by the style of published adventures, which tend to have many pre-defined scenes and routes through them that the players can follow.<br/><br/>Over time I got better at winging things that I hadn't written into the plots, and what I needed to write down in advance decreased as I grew more confidant in making it up when needed, and more importantly, at making sure that things I made up on the fly didn't run out of control on me (my first attempts  at improvised scenes always ended up with super powerful monsters and character death). I would say that 15 years ago I needed to write 3-4 page of preparation for a single night's 4 hour session, now I make do with a page of notes for 3 or 4 sessions.<br/><br/>I still write stuff down in advance, but they now tend to be very abbreviated notes. There is still usually a map because I tend to think in spacial terms, and there will be a brief paragraph to myself about what this particular story would be about like "The PC's are offered work ridding a village of a gang of bandits that have been stealing cattle. The lord's men are tied up in the Duke's recent war and the bandits are running wild. They will be paid 2000 silver pieces and any of the bandit's equipment they can carry away."<br/><br/>That would be followed by a sketch map, and then notes on the major NPCs they might meet, the bandit leader, the local lord or his factor, the village headman, and the combat stats (if its that sort of game) for the typical bandits. The most important part of this other than the map would be the names of the NPCs because I suck at making up names on the fly.

I think the more the GM is seen as 'entertaining the players' or 'presenting a story to the players' the more preparation they need to do in advance. Some people here are obviously very much not into the idea of Gm as entertainer, but I've been having some discussions with my GURPS players recently that have revealed that they really do want this. They *want* to be entertained, they don't want to share narration, they don't want to step back from the characters and shape the story. i.e. they very much *want* the GM to write the plot.<br/><br/>Anyway ...

Have you ever read a published adventure or module for D&amp;D?  I'm not talking about, like, a setting book.  I mean a published adventure where it says something like "For 5 characters of levels 1-3" on the front.<br/><br/>That's what I think of when I think of the GM making the plot.  What's in that book is what the story is and deviations from that written material become a balancing act between giving the players what they want (plus a sense of freedom) and getting them back to the written material.<br/><br/>In my experience, it's as simple as the GM saying "...and then, the characters will..." and the players going along with it, either out of a sense of cooperation, a sense of obligation, accident, or manipulation.<br/><br/>I've played RPGs for around 15 years, now.  Unlike you, the majority of my experiences have been of the GM creates the plot sort.  That is, until the last couple of years.  Now that I've gotten away from it, I can't understand how or why I'd ever want to go back.  Additionally, and perhaps of interest to you, before the past couple of years, I always found the idea of GMing to be a great deal more fun than the act of it.  Now, I'm the opposite.  I think the reason is that the plot and the role of the characters in it always seemed much more interesting in my head (when <b>I</b> was writing it) than it did at the table (when <b>we</b> were playing it).<br/><br/>Let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like to hear about.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101793/#Comment_101793" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T02:40:55+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  2:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Renato pretty much has it.  There's another, slightly more "Story" orientated way of looking at it though:<br/><br/>The players create and own their characters.  They have complete control over what their characters do.  They make their character's motivations clear to the GM.<br/><br/>The GM, using his knowledge of the players and their characters, creates a story in which the PCs (either individually, or as a group) have a role to play, but he's pretty confident that he knows almost exactly what the PCs will do at any time.<br/><br/>For example, in the classic Shadowrun game, 95% of character motivation usually comes from money.  By having Mr Johnson offer the players a suitable sum to take a reasonable job, the GM can be pretty certain that the PCs will accept.  <br/><br/>So now the PCs are going to break into building X and steal McGuffin Y.  The GM doesn't care how they do that.  Whatever the PCs come up with will probably be fun to play and it'll either succeed or fail.  Assuming that the PCs succeed, they'll had the McGuffin over the Mr Johnson and get their cash.  In Story terms, there's really only one plot: the PCs are hired by Mr Johnson to steal the McGuffin and they steal it.  This plot if created by the GM, and the players (essentially) follow it.<br/><br/>In a more "story" oriented game things are slightly more complicated.  Vampire, for example, quite often works in a way where the GM spends a lot of time second guessing what the players will want to do based of their character's motivations.  So a character who'd loyal to person X can be made to follow plot Y by fictional forces putting pressure on character X.  "The Anarchs are threatening to make your herd inaccessible because they no longer feel safe in the park."  The GM knows that the player will therefore look into why the Gangrel are not feeling safe in the park.  He expects the character to ask around or go to the park, and has clues prepared.  He knows that the player will follow these clues to the showdown with his hated ex-wife, who's now a werewolf (or whatever) killing vampires in the park.  The GM doesn't so much force the players down a path as wave a big carrot in front of them in the form of an easy way for the players to follow their character's motivations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101794/#Comment_101794" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T02:41:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  2:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience the "GM writes the plot" idea is supposed to mean that the GM comes up with situations for the characters to face (like he would in most other games), but then also determines how the various situations are linked to one another or lead from one to the other. <br/><br/>It's the last part that can cause problems.

Some guys were stealing stuff and someone got shot during the robbery and the Carusobot turns up and gets his gang of cops to figure out who the robbers are and to stop them.  And there was this really cool plot involving the robbers stealing stuff as a cover and the whole point was to kill the guy they shot and make it look random because he was a DA investigating some drug kingpin or something.<br/><br/>But the point is that the cool plot about the drug kingpin and the motivations for the crime and all that stuff all happened before the Carusobot got involved.  And in the typical investigation game, the players are the Carusobot and his gang.  They turn up after the plot has happened.  That plot was created by the GM, and if the players ask the right questions and make the right die rolls (or, if you're using Gumshoe you don't even roll the dice) they get this pre-written plot which has already happened revealed to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101799/#Comment_101799" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T03:07:47+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's just folk terminology for designing starting points for scenes and the relationships between them.

All games feature customs or design elements intended to restrict player choice and make their connections. Dungeon based design uses a physically embodied flowchart. Social-site games like Vampire are based on social relationships and customs.

In most games it's the job of the GM to get the group from one situation to the other. He's usually the person to frame scenes, establish opposition and provide the players with something their characters can aim for. You have to tie it to what's come before in some way, obviously. Otherwise it's just a random collection of events - like a really crude dungeoncrawl. Seguing from one situation to the another takes quite a bit of practice. <br/><br/>It gets murky when there's some disagreement about how far the GM is allowed to go to do this. Accusations of railroading, illusionism, etc. often follow, when the players feel that he has crossed some 'obvious' and 'self-evident' line. I've met a few GMs who were actually very reluctanct to frame scenes, wrap up scenes or even give the players something to play towards in fear of railroading the group. Unless the players were able and willing to take over those jobs, the game would slow down to a never-ending agonizing crawl.<br/><br/>"GM writes the plot" can be read as an attempt to encourage GMs to hold on to their reins. Although it can just as easily lead to GMs actually sidelining the players to playing-by-numbers while the plot and the story keeps going. Which I've also experienced in some games. As I said, it's murky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101804/#Comment_101804" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T03:27:16+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  3:27AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that makes good sense, Georgios.

"Go on this Shadowrun for money" seems like "Go judge this town, Dog." Are they different?</blockquote>\nGiven Shadowrun's age and that it's a product of it's era, the answer isn't really as simple as all that but here we go:<br/><br/>With Dogs, the text presents exactly one way to play.  You are Dogs, you go from town to town doing what Dogs do.  There's no attempt to make it a setting to play whatever in: You wouldn't be playing the Steward of a town or a trader from back east for example, and you wouldn't set the game in that setting's Germany.<br/><br/>In the default Shadowrun campaign, the PCs are runners motivated by cold hard cash.  While there's nothing explicit in the game's text which says players have to accept jobs, that's implicit.  There's this great illusion that the PCs don't <b>have</b> to accept the job.  This suits some players, because they want to play a social character with a good negotiation skill and they can try to get more money from Mr Johnson.  But in reality, every game of Shadowrun starts with an opening scene in which, at the end, the players take the job the GM's prepped.  I started running adventures which started with characters already staking out the target building when I ran SR recently (2004, I think), because everyone decided that the initial "you go to a nightclub and meet Mr Johnson" scene is a total fucking waste of time.<br/><br/>(Some GMs will prep 2 or 3 jobs and the players will genuinely get to choose which one the PCs accept.  This is rare and a bit hatstand from my POV, but hey, if you've got time to do 3 times as much prep as you have to for a Shadowrun game <i>and enjoy it</i>, that's well wicked.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've run games of Shadowrun where the players weren't just typical runners motivated by cash alone.  I ran a game where the payers were cops in the Lone Star Department Of Paranormal Investigation.  There the players didn't have any illusion that they had a choice over what jobs to take.  I ran a game where the players were a street gang, trying to drag themselves up from the street and carve out some turf.  The players really did pretty much do whatever they wanted whenever they wanted with the motivation to make their gang more powerful and richer.   Another game had the players as veteran runners caught up in a massive conspiracy where they were fighting for their lives and those of their families and friends.  Again, the players had to make some pretty tough choices about things (do I go hell-for-leather to defeat this thing, and if so, what do I do about my sister who's thrown in with the Atlantean Council?).  I had players as freedom fighters in central America in another game, Mafia Enforcers in another and a pirate TV crew in another.<br/><br/>So, as a very open, sprawling and expansive setting you can see there are a lot of different ways to run the game.  This was pretty common for games of that time, late 80s/early 90s.  But there's a default campaign structure, and that one's "you want money, this is how you're going to get it this week".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101808/#Comment_101808" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T04:01:47+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  4:01AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 4:02AM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s worth looking at the various Gumshoe games.

There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that the players will uncover the bare bones of the mystery (perhaps where the monster that killed the original victim), but they can uncover that mystery in various ways, and find out about different details and subplots.<br/><br/>Usually, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s be an initial location (e.g. a murder scene), which will contain various clues. That might suggest various other locations (the victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s flat, the home of the victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s parents, the pub he drank in). All of these are prepared by the GM, but might not be used. They\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll each contain chunks of the mystery to be uncovered.<br/><br/>Often, these various possible routes will converge on the same final location.<br/><br/>It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s great to play.

In most games I've known the GM can either follow the player's actions (acting like a "world simulating machine"), never EVER framing a single scene besides the very first (which will be "you all meet in a tavern", often). <br/><br/>Or he can frame very aggressively and say things like "and then, after 3 days of walk through the forest, you reach Whateverburg; it's drizzling, and the guards at the door look fiercely at you". Or, he could add "...you go inside the gate and enter the backsmith shop". But there are no guidelines as far as "how far is too far", and while the first framing will be acceptable to most groups (the decision to travel across the forest came from the group), the second can be viewed as railroady ("who told you we would go in the shop?")... or not. <br/><br/>The group may well think that the prepped plot requires them to meet the blacksmith, and be cool with that. <br/><br/>The very act of scene framing CAN be felt as the gm pushing the group in a direction. <br/><br/>And the very concept of scene framing is something I felt as completely new in the newfangled story/hippy games: classic games never mention it, they just imply it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101816/#Comment_101816" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T04:27:50+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  4:27AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Anything else is railroading (there is just one adventure and you must do it) and in a campaign I would strive desperatley to avoid it.</blockquote>\nIt's better than a single road railroad, but it's still a three way railroad <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What you are looking for, I think, is the so-called "bang based" games: there was a very interesting and enlightening thread here on SG some time ago about this... does some of the older sg-ers have some link?

Moreso than a plotted adventure, if you do it right... and this leads to another tool, I guess: relationship maps.<br/><br/>You as a gm don't NEED a predetermined plot if you have a network of NPCs (linked in some way to the PCs), each with their own motives, desires, and interests.<br/><br/>Whatever they choose at each bang-step of the story will have fallout on that map.<br/><br/>Did they investigate the murder? The Duke will probably look at them as good persons, and will have expectations. Maybe the evil mustache twirling Vizier will not be happy to have a bunch of freelances nosing around. <br/><br/>Did they ignore it? The Duke will consider those who he is related most to be insensible, or even rude about the issue. Maybe he will suspect of some of them, also. Oh, and next full moon the old Palace Guard's captain wife will be murdered. How the captain will react?<br/><br/>Not all of these actions and reactions will happen in front of the characters. But they will probably build up new bang-ideas for you, while the map evolves and changes in response to the characters actions.<br/><br/>Hope this all makes sense... and still hope someone more experienced will add something <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101819/#Comment_101819" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T04:46:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  4:46AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Call me stupid but doesn't any GM worthy of the name do this?<br/></blockquote>\nWhen you're running Dogs In The Vineyard, do you need to prep 3 towns and then ask the players which town they'll visit?  Nope.<br/><br/>How the PCs complete the mission is totally up to them.  Giving them an objective (the goal if you like) and no choice in what that objective is isn't a bad thing, it's part of playing Shadowrun.  That's just how the game* is supposed to be played.

If the players want to come up with some crazy scheme involving a helicopter, a bribed security consultant and 3 tons of bacon fat, let that play out and see what happens.  If you've designed your mission right, there are probably 30 possible routes to the McGuffin that you never thought of.

I'm saying "Don't design missions so that there's only one true way of completing them and all other paths lead to failure."<br/><br/>* by which I mean, the "default campaign" where all the players are runners out for cash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101821/#Comment_101821" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T04:51:01+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  4:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>As I've posted in a different thread (on the GM as entertainer) I have players who don't want me to just do Bangs, they want me to offer a story and drive things.</blockquote>\nStory Games are not for everyone.  There are a lot of players who're just along for the ride: They actually want the GM to tell them a story, or to reveal bits of a story to them as a reward for something.  These players will not feel comfortable taking more control or being part of a game which doesn't work like that.<br/><br/>Which is totally fine.  They just want to play a different type of game to you.  So play different games.<br/><br/>I had to cut a player loose from my gaming space because he wasn't into that type of thing.  Great guy and a good friend, but he really doesn't want to play the types of game I want to, so we just don't game together any more.

The first one is what is going to motivate the PCs to do anything at all. This is often best couched as a single issue or question that they can't ignore. In LotR, it would be "Sauron is going to take over Middle Earth unless someone stops him". In horror, some sort of plot to save the world is common, but things such as the PCs exposing themselves to curses, etc. also work well. Or someone they care about going missing, etc.<br/><br/>Next, I write a backstory of what has happened so far, to the extent that understanding it will help the PCs resolve their issue. This may be subject to alterations later, especially if the players think of things that seem more fun than my ideas. This is a timeline leading up to the start of the game, basically. This tail must not be allowed to wag the dog. If there is more action and drama in the backstory than in the game, something is wrong!<br/><br/>Then I find some fun locations that the PCs are likely to end up while trying to resolve their issue, and write down who might be found there, what their motivations are and what resources they have available. I don't script scenes. I try to establish links between these locations, and connections to the backstory (clues, if you will). I avoid single points of failure like the plague. If it's important that the PCs read a certain book, I try to think of as many places where it might be (and how it might have got there) as I can. And where else the information might be found, such as talking to someone who has read it. A common theme in these locations is to have some kind of conflict in progress where the PCs arrival and/or intervention will make a difference.<br/><br/>Hopefully it's clear that there is one location where things will have to end up eventually if the situation is to be resolved. In LotR this would be Mount Doom, but I try to avoid having a clear single solution that must be used, only a place where things will come to a head. I will try to put potentially useful stuff both here and in the other locations, and insert elements that can be used to dramatic effect, like a volcano that can erupt, a tornado that can sweep in, a monster the size of a house that can be let loose, etc. Then I wing it, and hope that the players come up with some way of resolving things that we all find plausible and entertaining.<br/><br/>Lastly, there may be a "sting in the tail", if the story we eventually produce warrants it. This will not generally be a conflict, just a piece of evidence that puts part of the story in a different light. Lovecraft fans will have seen plenty of these!<br/><br/>The relationship between the "plot" and the PCs is a shifting one. Typically these days I get the basic idea down without much detail. Then I get the players to create characters, once I have enough to see what PCs will work well or badly with the sort of thing I have in mind. Then I start tailoring the game to the characters so that it ties in better to their personal issues, maybe links to their history in various ways, and isn't quite so "one size fits all".<br/><br/>Was that helpful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101829/#Comment_101829" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T05:16:58+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  5:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><b>So, what's it like?</b>What does the GM do? What do the players do? Please share your experiences.</blockquote>\nSome variations I've encountered (and liked):<br/><br/>1. Plot is a background, not on the foreground<br/><br/>The GM-written plot is something that strolls onward and the players are fine with this. It advances on it's own pace and ties things together - players concentrate on characters interacting with each other and with the world. The plot and characters part in it has to be believeable, though. The GM advances the plot when the play needs momentum or when he feels like it, but mostly concentrates on supporting whatever the players are doing at the moment.<br/><br/>2. The plot is very simple (like a situation, or a drastic change to it)<br/><br/>The GM creates an intresting starting situtation and possibly characters. Play proceeds pretty much like described above, except that there's really no plot to advance. At some point, GM might step in and drastically change the situtation (like, suddenly the characters who are participants in a reality-tv show and cut off from the rest of the world, notice that the rest of the world has been run over by zombies) and players react to that. More plotless and player-driven play ensues. The players role is to lead the play towards whatever they want; the GM's role is to support the players and only step in when needed. Needs much more improvisation than the previous example, unless the starting situtation itself is very constrained (like being in a reality-tv show).<br/><br/>3. Add enough fuel, wait for the explosion (not really a plot as such)<br/><br/>The GM prepares the characters and the starting situtation and perhaps anticipates what might happen based on those, and prepares some content for it. The concent might come into use or not. What happens is again player-driven play; the has injected enough stuff into the characters and starting situtations for players to grasp and then steamroll onwards. If play goes to direction he anticipated, then cool - he can use some of the prepared stuff. If not, he needs to improvise, unless they players happily do that by themselves. A GM with too much time in his hands might prepare a lot of stuff (like mapping out a lot of NPC's, their motivations and whatever) and just adjust it based on player iniative.<br/><br/>All these share approaches, I think, a certain degree of downgrading the importance of the "plot". It can exist, it can be really simple or straightforward, but it's rarely on the foreground as some kind of dotted red line that players are eagerly expected to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101831/#Comment_101831" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T05:24:37+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  5:24AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've remembered that I have an adventure I've written online (<a href="http://www.teuton.org/~stranger/GAMES/pokethulhu/sunnich.html" rel="nofollow">Saving New Sunnich</a>) this is a very simple thing, for the Pokethulhu game, but it is typicalish of the kind of preparation I'd do for a Convention game or the like, and similar (if, say, three times as long and twice as specific) as what I might note down for an average GURPS session.

I'm running a D&amp;D 3.5 game for a bunch of cool guys. There's a lot of ways to GM a D&amp;D game, but I'm definitely going with the idea that I create a plotted story for the player characters to discover and interact with.<br/><br/>For me, this means that I create strong NPCs with motivations, and at the top of the story, I create their actions. It also means that I'm not above doing stuff with no PCs present, which is super-different for me. Since the plot is separate from the player characters, I have the freedom to make it not about them. As an example: in our first game, the big adventure was a mine cave-in that the PCs had to rescue guys from. The mine cave-in was orchestrated by the big bad guy; he wanted to get all the heroes out of town so he could steal something. Now, I did give them several clues and chances to run back to town, but I expected them to do what did happen: they stayed at the mine, and the guy stole something, so next session, they have a reason to chase him into the wilderness. Even if they'd gone back, he's 4th level and they're 1st, so he would have beat them silly.<br/><br/>I would never, ever do this in, say, The Shadow of Yesterday. In that, I'm not making a plot separate from the PCs. It's a given that the PCs are the plot, and it revolves around them. One's not really better than the other, and I'm finding it super-refreshing to play with my NPCs ahead of time, deciding that they're going to do this, then that, then the other. In any game like this, unless you take super-tight control, the PCs and plot will collide and both will change because of it. I expect in session 2 or 3, I'll have to start changing the plot based on what happens with the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101835/#Comment_101835" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T05:38:48+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  5:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>That's because solipsism is the opposite of investigation.

The plot is constructed from encounters with that unknown, which exists outside of the players creative frame of reference. When you have that, the investigation has verisimilitude that extends beyond how the narrative hangs together. The GM doesn't have a plot; she just has the facts. Players manipulate their access to and interpretation of the facts. The facts are not the plot. I find the gun and the act of discovery -- that I find that gun in that way -- is what matters.<br/><br/>By contrast, when you generate the discoveries yourself you can fine tune the narrative flow to a great degree, but you sacrifice that verisimilitude. The tension occurs based on your ability to direct the narrative instead of the facts you can pull into the narrative. I make the gun appear and what matters is how well I make that appearance make sense.<br/><br/>I think you could probably combine approaches with some kind of mystery generator (roll 13 or draw from the deck; you find a gun, but you determine its significance), but I think a lot of people find looking for random results kind of hollow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101853/#Comment_101853" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T06:13:56+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  6:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got exactly what you meant Malcolm, I didn't reply because I didn't want to make another post about my Solipsist playtest ... even though you used the word 'solipsist' and that makes it hard to resist!

If you've done that for a few key players, and outlined the places they are in and so on, you hate to see it wasted by not being used ... but that is the price of preparation.

If you've played in games with GM-run plots that really grabbed the players, you will <i>never</i> labor under that misconception again; just because the GM creates the plot and the players choose to only interact with and attempt to affect that plot through their characters is in no way similar to the players being "just along for the ride."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101881/#Comment_101881" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T07:23:47+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  7:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 7:25AM by Valvorik.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At high end of GM control, GM Plot = Hidden Story.  There in the module or the GM notes is the story all written out.  Players with their PC's will bring "their interpretation" to it and yes Mel Gibons or Lawrence Olivier as Hamlet may seem like a different play but what makes it different is their choices as actors, they are not the author of the story.<br/><br/>At low end it's GM Plot = Conflict Web etc. (cf Chris Chinn's writing) of a situation that is a sandbox for the Players to have PC's play in.<br/><br/>The major issue is not to be confused about style of play.  If somebody thinks they have more choice than they do, they're going to be frustrated.  If they think play is to advance without them choosing, they (and others) will be bored.<br/><br/>In full on Predetermined Plot and Hidden Story, the GM scripts events (scenes and conflicts) to happen before they are played out. This might be a plot or adventure created before play, or a flowchart of possible events. The players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 choices are limited to fit within the predetermined constraints of the Hidden Story.  This is the play-style assume by D&amp;D etc.  Dungeons are really massive flow charts (as others have said in other places).<br/><br/>The key scripted events exist before play begins.  These are then revealed as play progresses.  Thus it is \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hidden Story\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  Player choices lead down various branches but these branches generally reconverge around the core events the GM has prepared.  All roads lead to Rome, and funnily enough all have an identical group of bandits on them and the same wandering seer with a cryptic prophecy.<br/><br/>A Hidden Story uses on \xe2\u20ac\u0153adventure hooks\xe2\u20ac\x9d to show the way to a specific story.  PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s are expected to respond affirmatively to the plea for help or chance of pirate gold ~ or there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s no game tonight.   A hook is usually not only the reason PCs get involved but also a description of what sort of story is going to follow subject to any plot twists.  In Hidden Story, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the GM who authors plot twists and surprises both Players and PCs with them.<br/><br/>A good GM tailors the adventure, starting with its hooks, to be multifaceted, appealing to all characters and thus avoiding stress on character concepts and in fact allowing those concepts to be demonstrated and fulfilled with the story.  Story fits the characters because it draws on their past play and character/player interests to make the hook (and the adventure) responsive to their interests.  The GM modifies the story and upcoming scenes to account for the effects of choices PCs have made and possibly the reactions of Players.<br/><br/>Play tends to focus on Challenges because the range of choices and outcomes involved do not have to significantly change what sorts of scenes follow.  If Players could suddenly go off to explore a different part of world or undergo a fundamental personal shift that changed their priorities, then the conditions for the Story would change and throw it into disarray.  When the kind of Player choice play focuses on is the tactical/strategic choice involved in facing Challenges, the Players can make choices without changing the GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s planned plot.<br/><br/>Hidden Story also works well for Challenge-based Gamist play because it means there is time for a GM to prepare scenes to be \xe2\u20ac\u0153balanced Challenges to effectiveness\xe2\u20ac\x9d and present exciting action set pieces - time to think these out in advance and \xe2\u20ac\u0153calculate them\xe2\u20ac\x9d is useful.<br/><br/>Hidden Story's approach to balance and \xe2\u20ac\u0153equal player time\xe2\u20ac\x9d though ensuring the planned scenes include opportunities to test each PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s design and effectiveness, giving each a chance to show their particular abilities are useful and that the player is effective at using them (e.g., see the Challenge Design section).  The Hidden Story may have \xe2\u20ac\u0153spot light\xe2\u20ac\x9d scenes built into it for different PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s (rather than system economies etc. for such).<br/><br/>A GM may revise the Hidden Story on an ongoing basis to give other Player choices meaning and impact (e.g., there was no scene with woodland fey planned but the players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 idea of getting their assistance is accepted as a valid strategy and the scene is created).  The most \xe2\u20ac\u0153player denying\xe2\u20ac\x9d approach to player creativity is for the GM to deny hope of success to any pathway except the one the GM (or a module author) created before play began (opposite of Say Yes or Roll the Dice).<br/><br/>A common flaw in \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hidden Story\xe2\u20ac\x9d is that much of the story is never revealed to anyone but the GM (e.g., the elaborate history of the situation that is presented in the opening text for the GM but which is never anywhere revealed to players).  A newer generation of module (Goodman Games) tries hard to move away from this ~ there coming the time when every bit of background the GM had at the start also becomes known to Players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101885/#Comment_101885" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T07:47:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  7:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In full on Predetermined Plot and Hidden Story, the GM scripts events (scenes and conflicts) to happen before they are played out.

All games have mechanisms that restrict player choice. Sometimes they're informal and sometimes they're formal and rulesy. Nobody's ever going to resolve a Burning Empires plot with a noninfected human/Vaylen alliance to explore the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, except perhaps in response to me saying this. DitV games do not generally veer into "Fuck the townies, we're going to live apart as locust eaters to become pure." To take a page from my own gaming, my players like to get into a Sims-type thin managing their characters' budgets, furnishing apartments and so on. Our usual systems don't support it, so this isn't something that's especially sustainable.<br/><br/>The flowchart is not a necessary structure, though. Games where play changes relationships instead of just causing movement along a path are pretty standard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101886/#Comment_101886" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T07:52:59+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  7:52AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 7:57AM by Matt Snyder.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to run games with predetermined plot ALL THE TIME. It went something like this. <br/><br/>I'd create a "campaign" which meant I had this setting (a place) and a bunch of NPCs. I'd explain to my players what the deal was, like it's D&amp;D fantasy without all the weirdness or think X-Files (two actual examples). <br/><br/>But, I'd already created the things they were "supposed to do." I'd create set pieces and determine their outcome. For example, they encounter a serial killer who gets away but not before leaving clues. Yes, they could fight him a little bit. No, it didn't really fucking matter. Yes, they went along for the ride. <br/><br/>And, I built these things as rising stories that culminated in a climax. So, for example, one player had built a dragonslaying paladin and a fun backstory for how his ancestors had failed and he was cursed by a squire ghost to go kill this big bad black dragon. WHADDYA KNOW! They fought it and he won. Lots of that went down.<br/><br/>So, some interesting things happened here. The players were protagonists in that they were the main characters of a building story. This wasn't me, as the GM, having them as sideline "helper" characters to the real NPC hero or something. BUT! They were not protagonists in that they really had very little input and choice in how things went down in the story of events. That was me, deciding everything for them. And, even more scary, I had many, many of the events decided long before we even started PLAY. It wasn't gonig "Hmm, well they screwed THAT up good. What should I have them do now." It was "Ok, they did Part A, now on to Part B, and after that they'll fight and win Part C."<br/><br/>This was, of course, some pretty heavy-handed illusionism. It was fun at the time. The players enjoyed it. They still talk about those old campaigns fondly. While they may have rose colored glasses about much of those days, I don't see any regret or concern that they didn't have any real input on the story. And, they enjoyed the story, such as it was. (To be clear, they sure as hell liked the fighting set pieces and other situations. Looking back, that's the core of their fun, I think, and a big part of how people enjoy "GM writes the plot" kind of play.)<br/><br/>I'll never do it again, I hope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101887/#Comment_101887" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T07:54:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  7:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>Or to phrase it in a less inflammatory way: there are a lot of players who prefer to interact with the game only through their character, and want someone else to tell them what the results of that interaction are.

applicable to bringing the awesome in a game they're running as a GM.  The only real difference between the two situations is that as a GM they have the <i>option</i> to do more preparation in advance, because they don't have to fit in anyone else's suggestions unless they really want to.  Yeah, for a lot of people doing the preparation in advance makes sense and produces a better result (for exactly the same reason that a tightly-scripted comedy sketch is typically funnier than 90% of improv), but that just makes it something you <i>want</i> to do, not something you absolutely <i>need</i> to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101891/#Comment_101891" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T08:04:22+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:04AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>There are players who feel their point of entry into the world is, and should only be, their character.</blockquote>\nYeah, quite a few in fact.

Which is that when we in story-games talk about plot, we're talking about the sort of player agency that we're looking for in play. Terminology like plot aside, the question comes down to several styles of play. Yes, they're all ways to move the narrative forward. But you can't ignore that different versions will appeal to different players differently. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is why John is doing this thread, to see what actual play looks like that people are associating with the term plot, where people feel that the GM is controlling the plot. Even better, it's about when the player feels that they have control of their character's destiny to some extent. Note that the question of players having "Narration powers" or such is ancillary to the question here, one can be satisfied or disappointed simply by how much agency they have over their own character. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe examples can be boiled down into four categories, roughly. The examples below are all ones I've experienced, and I'll give examples of each to stay in the spirit of the thread:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Railroading - or what many people would call railroading for certain, because it's at a level of GM control where the player has very little agency. This is the point at which there is not even an appearance of player control of their characters. As an extreme example, I once played in a game where the GM actually did the dialog for everybody's character. The player's role was, as far as I could tell, to just answer "yes" when he asked questions like, "Do you follow him?" I've never heard anyone say that they enjoy this sort of play, but I suppose it's not impossible. After all, one can enjoy somebody telling them a story. It's just that the expectation for RPGs is that they are somewhat more interactive than this. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Illusionism - I played this way for years. Basically the players are made to feel like they have agency over all of their character's actions, but the results of those actions are manipulated behind the scenes so that the outcomes are always the same. The classic example is a technique that I used a lot called the magician's force, where you say, "Do you go right or left?" and no matter which way they choose, you have the encounter you want at the end of that road. More practically, when the plot "goes off the rails" as is sometimes said, the GM can get it back on by manipulating the world such that the player decisions lead to the same effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I once had this scenario where the idea was that the PCs would eventually discover that this lord of a castle was a demon in disguise (based off something I downloaded off the net). But the players smelled something funny right off the bat, and stated that their characters were going to go straight to him to confront him and force him to tell them what was up - skipping all of the clever challenges and such that I'd set up along the rout to discovery. So I simply said that the lord had left to go on some errand by a magical portal that could only be used once a day. So they couldn't follow him to ask, and were left to do the investigation in the manner that I had planned for them to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it appears to the players that their choices are meaningful... if only the lord had not left, they would have been able to confront him. But what's really going on is that I as GM was using my authority to create facts to control the outcomes of the PCs actions to cause the plot I want to occur. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent Illusionism is usually understood by the players to be occuring. In the case above, in fact, after playing one of the players asked just how much I was shifting facts behind the scenes to make things work out the way they worked out. And I lied and said that it was only a little. When, in fact, it was pretty much 100%. The only time I wasn't controlling the outcomes of what the players did, was when they were following the cues that were laid out for them to follow. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut from other comments from the same group at other times, I could tell that, basically, the player's felt that their participation in the game was mostly about overcoming the combat challenges presented. And that, while they weren't feeling "railroaded" in the rest of play, they felt pretty much as though it was just their role to "go through the motions" of the plot I had devised. Put it this way: they weren't disappointed with their level of control of character, but it wasn't why they were coming to play, either. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Mixed - Nothing is 100%. That is, like one poster above, I would have multiple scenarii prepared, to allow the selection of the scenario to actually be something that the players controlled. Provide them with three plot hooks, and let them decide which one to take. Not that this is what anyone would consider plot control per se, but it's plot selection, at least. Also there might be scenes in these which are more "freeformy" in that there is no specific goal for the scene at all, except to "see what happens." Like in one case where I had just a court ball going on, with loads of NPCs, and the PCs were free to persue whatever agenda suited them. Of course in this case, the scene ended with one character turning into a werewolf, which put the plot firmly right back on track. Making much of what happened in the scene itself somewhat pointless, because we'd never get back to any of it in any substantial way. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Open - The term "plot" has, unfortunately, two pertinent meanings. One is "the plan of the villain" or that sort of thing. As in "he was hatching a plot." So some people think of plot in terms of the "facts" of the situation which remain to be discovered. This is an entirely different sort of set-up, however. Just as the dungeon situations of olde, they simply set the stage for the PCs, who are then allowed to roam it at will, and deal with what they find there as they wish. In this case, there is complete player agency. This is how I've played almost exclusively for the past 4 years. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, recently I had a player decide that his character was going to remove her mind from her body, and put it into this dome of mental power, and then make an automaton of her body. This was quite out of the blue, and I hadn't imagined that it would happen at all. Since then, play of that game has revolved around the effort to make these two magic experiments work. The first stage is complete, but the second has involved going far off to the character's father in a goblin stronghold, the other players' characters' stories revolving around this trek as background (one is, for example, considering that he may want to deal with the goblins committing slavery, as he is militantly against it). <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I have no plot, just the evolving situation, and how everybody reacts to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101909/#Comment_101909" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T08:50:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  8:50AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, being that most play is mixed in some way, everybody is going to point to specific examples of where the GM controlled where the action went next, and in other cases to where the players did. Full railroading is actually pretty rare (mostly because I think those GMs don't get to run again). Illusionism as a technique is pretty darn common. Open play is too, as we're seeing from the examples. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to the extent that these things are mixed, you have, at best, a spectrum of GM control of events. Ranging from complete, constant control, down to control only of the elements that give players situations in which to make their decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nDown to where there's no GM, I suppose. What I've never seen is a GM who did not have the power to control events that was equivalent to that of the players, via the agency of "everything else." It's not ever about one side or the other having all of the power. It's about how to share the power to control outcomes through character agency, in order that the result of play be a collaboration in which every participant has gotten to add a part to play that has engaged them creatively. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101912/#Comment_101912" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T09:07:18+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  9:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>Or to phrase it in a less inflammatory way: there are a lot of players who prefer to interact with the game only through their character, and want someone else to tell them what the results of that interaction are. They're not sitting in the car and looking out the window as the scenery rolls by, they're using a very specific tool with very specific limitations to try and push a situation not of their own devising towards conclusions which they hope will be satisfying.</blockquote>\nExactly what I was saying in the "GM as Entertainer" thread. There are players who feel their point of entry into the world is, and should only be, their character.<br/><br/>Also, my vegan daughter refuses to eat my awesome baby back ribs, despite my best efforts to sway her.<br/><br/>I kid, I kid. The point of view you're coming from, however, is one of "but what does an existing player who really likes type of game X think about this stuff?!?"<br/><br/>Which is fine in itself, but understand that you're doing the same thing as offering a vegan some babyback ribs, then  perhaps reading outtward from that a bit too much.<br/><br/>Which isn't really shocking. I mean most rpgs designed for the first couple of decades of the existence of rpgs had no formal procedures for shared world-(or anything else) building.<br/><br/>I've also had people try gaming, and decide they really didn't like it, at least partly based on the fact that there wasn't more shared effort.<br/><br/>Have you ever experienced that, Hituro? You'll generally know it. It's the player that's constantly haring off, offering suggestions for what could happen or what might be there. They just can't seem to stay in their character's skin only.<br/><br/>I've had folks like that. They don't seem to do particularly well with traditional rpg set-ups. IME, they also don't tend to keep playing rpgs, regardless of how clever or imaginative they are unless they either become a GM or severley modify and limit their behavior.<br/><br/>Oh sure, on a local , ad-hoc basis, people did  that sort of thing. Some books might even have had stuff in the advice section on getting players more involved with that stuff. I know I had players in my very traditional games years ago doing stuff like that, or suggesting stakes, or offering scene-framing, etc, etc. It just wasn't formal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101925/#Comment_101925" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T09:30:08+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  9:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 9:30AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>- Open - The term "plot" has, unfortunately, two pertinent meanings. One is "the plan of the villain" or that sort of thing. As in "he was hatching a plot." So some people think of plot in terms of the "facts" of the situation which remain to be discovered. This is an entirely different sort of set-up, however. Just as the dungeon situations of olde, they simply set the stage for the PCs, who are then allowed to roam it at will, and deal with what they find there as they wish. In this case, there is complete player agency. This is how I've played almost exclusively for the past 4 years.</blockquote>\nThis is a great way of putting it.<br/><br/>Most of my games are "mixed" in this sense. There are a few scenes out there that the characters will get to, but they're very loosely constructed. My Star Wars Saga game is currently a 1 page summary of these along with relevant aspects of the global situation (this is, incidentally, really easy when the setting is well-developed). The scenes are very loose and could go down in a number of ways. In fact, much of my adventure writing professionally comes from analyzing these scenes after the fact (since players expect more support than a bunch of point form notes and in many cases, benefit from detail even as a springboard for taking a different approach).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101936/#Comment_101936" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T10:01:22+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 10:01AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah a key to all of this is in the difficult skill of determining what it is that the player wants to control.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Does your character take a bathroom break on the way there?"<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Huh? Whatever. Sure. Why are you asking?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM acting to limit player participation is usually doing the player a favor. The player doesn't want to have to decide whether or not his character has made a stop at the rest room, it's just not important to anyone. So if the GM frames a scene to where the character is going, and skips how he got there, this is more than acceptable, it's usually considered the GM's duty. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question of whether or not the GM is controlling things in a way that the player likes, has to do with whether or not it's facilitating him getting to make the sort of decisions he wants to make, or if it's making those decisions for the player. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what you're describing Malcolm, is pretty open really. The limitation in question, these wide-open scenes, just constrains the players in a way that gives them opportunities to make choices that are fun to make. I'm assuming. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is the key. Don't worry about "plot" and control of it, you will have some control of it, and need to (should be required to). The questions you need to ask yourself is these: <br/>\n - Am I giving my players decisions to make?<br/>\n - Are these decisions ones that the player is going to enjoy? <br/>\n - Am I making them "real" in that I won't take away the effect of those decisions, in order that the player doesn't feel cheated?<br/>\n<br/>\nBe proactive about it, not reactive. Worry less about whether or not you're taking away something from the player and worry more about whether or not you're giving the player something to do. See the GM role in the positive light of not what mistakes you might make, but what you're adding to the game for everyone. If you do that, I think you can't mess up. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101946/#Comment_101946" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T10:18:17+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 10:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm's post about having a loose set of ideas for scenes and when Mike said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>I think this is the key.

My experience, very likely similar to many other folks here, started with DnD where you couldn't really grace the sequence of play events as "plot," inasmuch as we pretty much went from room to room in a series of plundering, scorched-earth micro-raids.  Later I graduated to railroading plots (always with mixed success as player actions were inherently unpredictable), and then to illusionism. Player actions still lent an air of unpredictability to the game, but rarely disturbed the larger plot arc.<br/><br/>My turning point came when I ran a Vampire chronicle back in the mid-90's where I had a definite plot arc in mind and was running preludes with an eye toward setting up characters to fit into that plot.  In the Nosferatu's prelude, I tossed off some color point about a prophecy of Gehenna.  I didn't mean it as anything more than atmosphere, but the player seized on it and made dealing with that prophecy his character's mission.  His decisions totally broke my plot.  In essence, he took (unwittingly) a slew of Keys, including Key of the Prophecy, Key of Compassion, etc. and drove the plot into emergent territory.  I was never able to recover any sense of structured, locked-in plot, and the game events unfurled a three-ring circus tent of Awesome.<br/><br/>Nowadays when I GM, I try to set up story elements, set pieces, and relationship maps around the players and their flags in a way that establishes a modicum of dramatic tension at the outset.  Basically I poise the various pieces so that they are ready to tip in interesting ways, but I don't care which way they go, and I always remain open for the players to change anything.  Some world elements have their own agendas and momentum, but they basically change in response to the players' actions.  I try not to approach conflicts with any notion of a set outcome, though I'll drop a few Bangs in the pond to stir things up.  I may also nail down some big looming events in the future, though with the caveat that the player actions might change them or prevent their occurrence.<br/><br/>That's the ideal, anyway.  Doesn't always work.  I recently ran an Ars Magica game with the prototypical vis hunt.  I hadn't run one in awhile, and it turned out to offer a pretty linear set of encounters.  I realized I'd reverted to 1992 in terms of prep style.  Next time the challenge will be to make a vis hunt nonlinear while still offering the basic objective.  When I ran a mystery in the same Ars group, I set it up  with an R-map and let the players blunder through it.  Interestingly, they didn't really solve anything, just disrupted the hell out of the village they were there to help.  They emerged mostly clueless about what was really going on, but the body count was high enough to give them a sense of accomplishment.  IOW, they *thought* they'd resolved the problem.  They were wrong, so the dark forces in that little village will continue to tick away for another time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101971/#Comment_101971" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:12:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 11:13AM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the great responses. There are so many! Some replies and further questions below...<br/><br/><b>Rich:</b><br/>Thanks for talking about Shadowrun. That matches my experience of the game. That is, we always just took the jobs and did Shadowruns, but for some reason the illusion that we could "do anything" was always there. From my POV here and now in 2007, the Shadowrun set up (as well as the Dungeon set up) looks a lot more attractive when I think of it like a Dogs town.<br/><br/>That's a sign of my changing preferences more than anything, I bet.<br/><br/><b>Graham:</b><br/>I read Gumshoe. I'm with Rich. Most disappointing game of the year. Not because it's a bad design (it's not) but because it was so exactly the opposite of the game I wanted to play. A GM-authored crime that the PCs uncover is not what I think when I hear "GM writes the plot," but if that fits the bill for you, that's cool.<br/><br/><b>Dave:</b><br/>Great post. I see a description of how you run games... are you saying that's "GM writes the plot"? Do you identify that phrase as matching what you're doing now, or just the first bit with D&amp;D and CoC?<br/><br/><b>Jukka (Merten):</b><br/>Your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is very interesting to me. That matches what I've heard when people talk about GM-plotted games. The murky bits for me are phrases like, "The GM advances the plot," and "the plot strolls onward." Can you expand on that? What is the GM doing when she advances the plot? What role do the players have?<br/><br/><b>Clinton:</b><br/>Cool. That's exactly how I ran Talislanta. So your end of the GM-plotted spectrum is the part I know.<br/><br/><b>Rob (Valvorik):</b><br/>Great stuff! I see a distinction in my own play between creating a dungeon to be explored and creating a storyline and events ahead of time. What do you think? To me, those aren't quite on the same part of the spectrum. Same with adventure hooks followed by bangs. Your "A good GM..." paragraph matches a lot of play I've had, which I would not have characterized as GM-plotted. But I'm realizing that some people use that phrase to refer to that style of play, which is really helpful to know.<br/><br/><b>Matt:</b><br/>That's part of what was in my head when I hear people talk about GM-plotted games. Which matches my experience with pre-written modules. The other part has something to do with a "bigger" storyline -- authored by the GM only -- that serves as background or foreground to what the PCs do, depending. Did you have that "bigger and better" storyline hanging around somewhere in your pre-scripted games?<br/><br/><b>Mike:</b><br/>You are 100% right about why I am doing this thread. Great post!<br/><br/>I'm afraid we're wandering a bit into "how to be a good GM" territory, but that was probably inevitable for a thread like this. But maybe let's keep focused on actual play and reflection on what we've seen and done, rather than blueprints for how people should do X, Y, and Z.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101977/#Comment_101977" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:26:46+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really what I'd call "plotting" an adventure, but a standard technique I'd use would be to look at the PCs, then make an initial scene. I'd think about what might the PCs reasonably do in that scene.<br/><br/>1. If I could only think of one reasonable response for the PCs, I'd scrap the scene. No "meaningful" choice.<br/>2. If I could think of a bazillion reasonable responses quickly, I might scrap the scene, because it would be hard to know what would come next.<br/>3. If I could come up with 2 or 3 reasonable responses, I'd keep the scene, and then sketch out follow up scenes for each of those responses<br/><br/>I'd repeat the process for follow up scenes, with the exception of the "last" set of scenes, which would be ok (in fact preferable) to have an infinite number of reasonable responses - I'd ask the players what they planned to do next, end the game, and then repeat the process for the next game with the first scene being the reaction to their action to the last sessions last scene. <br/><br/>On the off chance players did not choose one of the "reasonable" options I'd planned for, I'd try to improvise and either go with the flow if I could, or force the game back on track if I was stumped for ideas.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I've seen other GMs use what I'd call "failed illusionism" - They are trying to make it seem like players have choices, but I see right through what they are doing and see a pure railroad. Being a cynical, old GM makes me pretty much immune to illusionism. To the point that even in open games I see railroading sometimes.<br/><br/>So how do I have fun? I ignore the "plot" and focus on what I do have control over: the reaction and feelings of the PC I control. I know in the back of mind as a player that I'm on a GM railroad, but I ignore that and just try to make believe I'm the character and feel what she feels, make ("meaningless") choices because she doesn't know those choices are meaningless, and so forth. With enough practice in "make believe" and separating "in game" (You are in a fight for your life against the orc hordes) from "out of game" (The GM is going to fudge the combat results so you can't lose or can't win) it doesn't matter whether I "really" have control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101979/#Comment_101979" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:34:54+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:34AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is how I'd do this sort of thing.<br/><br/>1) Play a session of a game.<br/>2) Come up with great grand schemes for all the major events in a five year campaign.<br/>3) Totally fail to advance towards these events, or indeed anything at all.<br/>4) Abandon game.<br/><br/>So it had a lot more to do with what was in my head than what actually happened in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101987/#Comment_101987" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:49:06+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 11:59AM by Valvorik.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Great stuff!

Though many published "outside dungeon" scenarios are qued up very much like a dungeon and I was bundling those together.<br/><br/>To me GM plotted mostly means "most scenes were in the GM's mind as at least a sketch before play started on the first scene" and the GM has a "this is the way it's going to go by default" set up.  Heavy GM plotted is the dungeon with a bit of story in it where every scene is mapped and the combinations are 80% known to GM though play can still surprise even the GM.  Low GM plotted means the situation is put out there and the Players say, "okay, we go to the docks and question dockworkers"  because that makes sense to them even though the situation didn't mention docks or dockworkers - and that is as useful a scene and as much a part of "story" as a scene the GM throws at players or one they call for following up on clear GM-presented-threads.<br/><br/>I probably see storyline as being capable of being just like dungeon because of an early and horrible "outside dungeon" experience I with a GM who did a wonderful job of evoking his homebrew setting (really wonderful, 10 years later I was still stealing images he had painted with words) but had as rigorous an idea of how our group of PCs was going to react and come down in the story as if there was a dungeon with only one room after one room and one door between them.  There was more choice in most maps than in his "out of dungeon" adventure.  At one point we were clearly thinking about coming down on a different side of a conflict and he just spontaneously had it break out including us on the other because clearly "his story" had us on that side.<br/><br/>That said, I think once you leave the dungeon with its walls, giving players the idea of "more choice" you're either going to be a clear railroader, a very inventive illusionist or you will actually start letting those choices matter and the differences will be clearer to everyone ~ even though they were present in dungeon too to some extent.  The "call for papers" thread link to the nordic theory sites leads to a great "historical view" of RPG play that starts with dungeon and then the highly structured "plotted story" outside dungeon and moving on from there.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101992/#Comment_101992" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T11:54:58+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>Have you ever experienced that, Hituro?

IME, they also don't tend to keep playing rpgs, regardless of how clever or imaginative they are unless they either become a GM or severley modify and limit their behavior.<br/><br/>Oh sure, on a local , ad-hoc basis, people did  that sort of thing. Some books might even have had stuff in the advice section on getting players more involved with that stuff.

Most people, if they like roleplaying at all, get hooked by the exact concept of taking over one character and immersing themselves in that character, and interacting with the game in only that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102006/#Comment_102006" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T12:31:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 12:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see this as having two meanings, one good and one bad:<br/>\n<br/>\nGood: The GM has the "story arc" taken care of, all you have to do is show up, play your character, follow the trail of bread crumbs and you'll get to some cool scenes which are sort of story-like.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad: The GM has written a fantasy novel in his head.

The proposed way of playing was to run through prepared adventure modules. Contrary to D&amp;D modules, however, DSA modules are not mainly dungeon crawls. They are basically pre-written stories in which the PCs get to act along certain lines. This includes advice on how to railroad them into particular places, deal with players who don't follow along properly, and so on. The core idea is this:<br><br>They are participating in the forming of the current history of the realm.<br><br>As such, history needs to be consistent. The outcome of a module was most of the time predetermined. They participated in a race by ship, through four modules IIRC, and their ship was going to win. That's official canon, reinforced through the publisher's "in-game" newsletter and future modules. Sometimes there was a chance for things to turn out differently, but it was emphasized that that would break canon and that you a) would have to modify some future adventures and b) wouldn't be part of the DSA community whose characters can identify with the official history as it unfolded.<br/><br/>Not all modules played into this. Some were just adventures in unimportant locations. Others made sure that, no matter what the outcome, the perception within the "world" would still be a certain way.<br/><br/>We ran through 25 or so modules, and we made up some stories of our own. But when we made up our own, we couldn't infringe on the important NPCs or events in the realm, because that again would mess up the continuity. We could have tossed all that aside and said, "Fuck this, we're doing our own thing," but that wasn't what the game told us, and we felt it had a certain amount of authority. We simply started running other games that allowed us more freedom.<br/><br/>So that's what prepared plot looked like for me; not exactly GM-prepared, but prepared nevertheless.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102013/#Comment_102013" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T12:46:24+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 12:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, let me add some specifics:<br/><br/>In the ship race, the main character of the story was the captain.

You can guess who was written about in the newsletter.<br/><br/>There was a module about a sorcerer in the desert. The PCs accompanied this amnesiac guy. Turns out the guy was a dragon in human form, and the key to solving the adventure (i.e., the main character).<br/><br/>And these are all official modules. They are meant to put the PCs alongside the realm's important characters and allow them to co-experience the important moments. Sometimes they can bring them about, but mostly along predetermined lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102016/#Comment_102016" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T12:51:15+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 12:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a bit confused by those who were disappointed with GUMSHOE.

Recently she recounted how she'd tried to anticipate which way the players would go at a particular juncture, such that she prepped two alternative scenarios for the next session.  To her surprise and frustration, the players chose neither A nor B, but H.  This kind of experience seems pretty symptomatic of the traditional GM role.  I can't count the number of times something similar has happened to me.  The best game experiences as a GM seemed to come when story happened as an emergent result of focusing on character relationships, drives, and issues.<br/><br/><i>Example of emergent story:</i>  In that Vampire game I mentioned earlier, the Nosferatu prophet guy had True Faith as a Virtue.  It almost never came into play for flashy, Beeg Angel scenes.  Only after the chronicle wrapped did we realize in the post-mortem that the key story element for that character was that he always achieved--through his faith--some sort of lasting positive change, even in small, personal ways, that added up to have a significant cumulative impact at the end.  No way I was smart enough to have engineered that, even if I'd wanted to.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the perceived default appears to be mission-based play, which is difficult, I think, to avoid structuring as a railroad.<br/><br/>Another "plot point" I'm curious about concerns what I'll call Sadistic Adversarial DM Syndrome.  Once upon a time, I went through a phase where I rode characters hard, not to the point where the player wasn't having fun (at least in the case of my particular players), but certainly enough that to say "hosing" happens would not be an unfair description.  Permanent loss of powerz, loss of favored NPCs, shifts in NPC relationships, imposition of permanent disabilities, etc., some of which strayed perilously close to treading on personal player issues.  We didn't need safewords, but the level of character adversity players had to face in my games was certainly high, to the point where in retrospect I think it verged on deprotagonizing.  In most cases, it was definitely a GM-plotful strategy since I wasn't giving players the option to buy into deep adversity.  I just slammed 'em with it.  In the end, the players usually found a way to overcome or adapt to their circumstances, and it lent a certain "no holds barred" flavor to the game, but I'm pretty sure if I were in the player seat, I'd have found it intensely frustrating to be subject to such an agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102018/#Comment_102018" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:01:47+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I hear people talk about this all the time.

Just answer based on whatever you think it means.</blockquote>\nOk, I'm intentionally posting a reply before reading the thread, I'll see afterwards if my answer would change on reading.<br/><br/>To make sense I have to define plot for this post, that's no comment on any other definitions, it's just to help folk make sense of what I'm saying here.<br/><br/>Ok, plot in this particular post means either of two things.  An existing situation the PCs will encounter and interact with OR a preplanned sequence of events the PCs will experience.  I'll call them for the sake of clarity in this post situational plots and prescripted plots.  Those are fundamentally different, hopefully how will become clear.<br/><br/>Drawing on my own experience.  <br/><br/>When I GM I usually in a new game draw up a situational plot (I never use prescripted plots).  How do I do that?  Let's take an example from actual play.<br/><br/>It's a Roman investigative game, the characters are not yet created but I know they will be of the Equestrian class and that as it is an investigative game the players expect a more mission based approach (I tend not to use mission based approachs outside of investigative games, but it's one example not all my gaming).  That's easy, as Rome has a patronage system.<br/><br/>I work out a murder, I work out who did it, why they did it, and how they did it.  I work out each stage of the process, who was involved, who might have seen stuff and what they might know.  I work out who the accomplices were and if they knew they were accomplices, I work out a pretty full account of what happened prior to play.  I also prepare brief notes (ie a line) on each of the NPCs, who they are, some traits, what they look like, what their motivations are (and that is the single most important thing about them).  As I know the murderer has resources to get thugs to take out the PCs should that be necessary, I stat up a couple of NPC thugs, but it's not a combat game so generally statting stuff is not important.<br/><br/>At this point I have a situation, I know what has happened prior to play commencing.  I have no idea what will happen once play starts, but given it's an investigative game and that's what the players are there to play I know that at the very least they will investigate and as I am good at running investigative games I don't need to worry about using illusionist techniques or the game bogging down on a single roll.  <br/><br/>Hm, possibly too easy an example so let's take a second, on this one I will not know what the players will do.<br/><br/>1770s Naples, the PCs are a motley band of chancers looking to make their fortune in a rich and at the time quite important city.  How do I prep the first situational plot?<br/><br/>Firstly, I create a hook to help the players out, so that if they're struggling to come up with their own plans on the night there's something to do still.  So, we have a contact of one of the PCs, an Irishman who poses as a French noble and gambles for a living, he will contact the PCs in fear of his life.<br/><br/>Why so?  Ok, I work out what he's done, who wants him dead and how they plan to do it.  However, this is not an investigative game, this plot is only there to help out if the players have no agendas of their own.  On the night, they take the plot, but they also bring their own agendas.  One wishes to obtain a ship for himself and present himself as a successful trading captain (a lie, but it's a game of lies), one seeks a sinecure within the Church, one wishes introductions to society to sell patent cures and the like.  I have in advance worked out who the key movers and shakers in town were before the PCs arrived, what they are like and what they want in life.  The PCs meet some of them, not others, but I in no way prejudge how they will interact with them.  It's a situation, nothing more.  Carlos Fuentes, a dangerous duellist the PCs encounter I had envisaged most likely becoming a foe, but he terrifies them so they befriend him instead and he becomes a close ally.  This is different to the Roman game because in the Roman game I knew roughly what they'd do, I knew they'd investigate a murder.  In the Naples game I have no idea what they'll do, but I have prepared the situation in the city in advance so whatever they do I can work out how the other important folk in town will react and then the game drives itself.<br/><br/>I'll post a second post on prescripted plots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102022/#Comment_102022" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:11:16+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, prescripted plots, I don't run these as for a variety of reasons I do not like them (with occasional exceptions in play at cons), but I have experienced them as a player.<br/><br/>Let's take another actual play example.<br/><br/>It's a supers game, the GM has worked out in advance who the baddies are and what their fiendish plot is.  So far no different from my style, the difference comes next.  I don't work out what will happen once play starts, the GM here has.  He has three or four (I forget) scenes and locations.  We have to go to each location to experience each scene, and we have to do so in a certain order.  If we do not for any reason, he intervenes either through illusionism or blatant railroading to make us do so.  He has the game already written out in his head, not every detail, but the broad story, it's the impossible thing before breakfast, he has written a story and we are experiencing it.  As he is not a skilled illusionist it feels like we are essentially contributing nothing, the plot advances regardless of our acts, the chief villian escapes regardless of our efforts, the plot demanded it so our actions didn't stop it.  <br/><br/>Another one, same style but this worked.  The setting is modern day Bilbao, we are angels, demons and mortals united to prevent an apocalypse which will undo creation.  The GM sent me his notes afterwards, he had also written down every location and every scene, and we had to go to each location in a certain order to experience the scenes in that order.  He had the whole game, in surprising detail, written down in those notes.  Where we would go, what we would do, how we would fare.  <br/><br/>But, the game rocked, I played the sequel at another con, it was great stuff.   Why so different?  Partly just better GMing, but partly because it was a tightly written prescripted plot, in each situation what he had written was what made sense in game for us to do, and we did it not realising it was already anticipated.  I don't think illusionism was used, just a tight control of situation and scene framing to ensure that he could accurately predict what we would do and prepare the game accordingly.  More work than I would do myself, but we all have our own styles.  The point for this thread was literally the game was plotted out in advance, each scene, each location, the NPCs, the outcomes.

Advancing the plot is not in my gift as I have no view of where things will go, that's for the players.<br/><br/>In my second category advancing the plot generally means getting it back on track, which if done well may result in a more fun game ("man, I'm glad we met that hermit with the map, I felt we were just wandering around aimlessly there") and done badly may make a less fun game ("man, we take a moment to kibitz and check out the scenery and suddenly hermits are showing up with fucking maps, oh well, back to the quest I guess").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102030/#Comment_102030" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:27:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:27PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, adventure write-ups have a lot of influence on all of this. Back in the 90's my method of prep was to steal adventure write-ups off the internet... this is how I had so many available. One place I often went was this site (or it's predecessor?): http://www.rpgarchive.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's filled with adventures like this (I picked this randomly off the front page, and, lo, it's typical): http://www.rpgarchive.com/pdf/ArcticStation2293.pdf<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll note how there's an "Optional Encounter" in the first "Chapter" that's designed specifically to get rid of equipment that the GM doesn't want the characters to have. That's right, those decisions that you made about your equipment? We're making those null, by taking it away from you, because some of it might make the adventure not go like it's supposed to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nClassic. First one I picked at random. Didn't even have to look at two. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, of course you don't have to play it this way, or even read in the subtext that I did... from a very gamism POV, it's just another part of the challenge (they can actually win the encounter in theory, I think, and not lose their equipment). There are methods by which you can use such a text, and not follow it's implications or suggestions, of course. You can even get to the end of the scenario, if you're creative enough, without what I'm implying. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I didn't. If I'd had that scenario as one of mine, I'd have thought "Hmm, to make it so that we can play to the end, I'll use this encounter." That is, in that mode of play, it seemed like a good way to play at the time. Even if, overall, my play was sucking, and I couldn't figure out why. Turned out it was lack of player engagement, because I wasn't giving them stuff to do. 20 mins of fun packed into 8 hour sessions. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause that's how these texts taught me to play. You can say that I ought to have known better, or that you did know better, and never played this way. But there it is, some of us made the mistake. Thing is, with a different text, you can avoid the problem 100%. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, John, if you want to know how I was playing when I controlled the plot, look at the archive, read the adventures there, and you'll quickly get the idea of how I was playing. The texts do a lot of "Then this happens to the PCs." Or even "When the PCs do this..." Leaving the GM to figure out how to make it happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust sayin. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102032/#Comment_102032" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:31:09+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><b>Dave:</b><br/>Great post.

I'd say it's the thing that I do now that corresponds most nearly to "GM writes the plot". It's what I think of when you say that to me. It's particularly my approach to investigative Lovecraftian horror, which I won't call CoC, because I'm using FATE, not BRP, to run it. <br/><br/>But it's not how I run everything. It's not how I run DitV (by the book, as far as I can). It's not how I used to run Jorune (much more of a sandbox, with lots of possible things the players could get involved in, but no assurance that they would do any of it) (not always 100% effective, as it's difficult for Jorune players to be proactive until they get to grips with the setting, which takes time). And it's not how I will run DRYH, when I finally get some going! I like games where I feel well prepared, and able to insert details with confidence when needed. But I also enjoy running it fast and loose and improvised, so long as it doesn't get too handwavy where it seems like it should be solid.

The best way I can put it is that there are sequences of scenes where there is no interesting failure option. Literally, sequences where the text says, "Have the players make Gather Information checks to get the following info. If they fail the check, have their patron give them the info." I.e., set pieces that are going to happen and info that is going to be delivered no matter what, because <i>not</i> having them means that the adventure <i>cannot</i> continue. Sure, <i>how</i> the PCs overcome the challenges can vary, but the fact they <i>must</i> overcome them, and usually in a specific sequence, is a given. The real challenge is how many PCs will have to die in order to make the finish. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This has not been a big deal for my group, though, as I've been actively pointing out the "rails" as we go along.

Latest example - <a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/SceneEGaranChaos" rel="nofollow">the update I just did to the Chaos scene</a>.

That matches what I've heard when people talk about GM-plotted games. The murky bits for me are phrases like, "The GM advances the plot," and "the plot strolls onward." Can you expand on that? What is the GM doing when she advances the plot? What role do the players have?</blockquote>\nWell, let's think about, for example, campaign set in Second World War, or pretty much any "realistic" military campaign with grunts as player characters. The overall plot would be what ever happens to the character's company (platoon, team, whatever the scale is) - they move from battle to battle, town to town. The characters (and thus, players) have no say about the plot, it's very fixed, especially if the plot follows historical details. The GM moves the military unit forward, towards the next objective, roughly following historical data.<br/><br/>I also ran a campaign some years ago, one that had very fixed plotline (kind of by accident; I ran a one-shot with minimal preparation time and it was extended to a campaign as things just clicked), which was advanced as a kind of a breadcrumb -trail. Characters investigated their way through a set of places and the silent agreement was that I'd push the plot forward when ever I felt like it. I basically introduced a new place or a setting in every session.<br/><br/>What is left to the players is, well, everything else. The actual plot-forwarding action in sessions is quite minimal; most of the time is taken up by players just interacting with each other and in lesser extent, NPC's and world in general. When I started the mentioned one-shot, I had predicted that characters, FBI agents, would be out from their briefing in FBI HQ and in the place of their investigation, some few hundred kilometers away, in matter of hour. The first stop and Yer Local Roadside Diner took three hours of playing time as the players just expanded and added depth to their characters and relationships. Same trend continued; a scene which, if played just to move on the plot, would take an hour, usually took about four hours. Of that four hours, roughly 80 percent is dialogue and interaction between the characters (and possible NPCs), in which the players establish their characters into the fiction and act in the fiction. Granted, the tone of the game was slightly humorous and gave plenty of opportunities to play on stereotypes, but that's about the average spread on player activities we have.<br/><br/>The plot there, in both cases, is a pacing tool and a loose framework of mostly pre-determined story. You move along with it when the group has exhausted the momentum of the current scene - and with momentum I mean, for example, conflicts in character-to-character relationships which slowly build up as the scenes go forward, until at some point they flare up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102104/#Comment_102104" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T17:02:44+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  5:02PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems relevant to mention Piratecat, a mod over at ENworld, who's considered the greatest DM who ever lived on those boards.

The first time, I went completely 'No Myth'.  I had an immediate situation for the characters to react to, and a general sense of stuff the main bad guy was doing in the background.  Then as the players reacted to the initial situation and moved forward, I did a lot of just-in-time plotting, laying down things for the players to discover just before they got there.  Somewhere about halfway through the campaign, I finally had a sense of what the 'big picture' was and what the players were likely to do as a result, and from then on I didn't do as much plotting in the nick of time as much as I just let things play out to their natural conclusion.<br/><br/>For the second campaign, I had a much more specific idea of what the big picture was from the start.  There were things that were going to happen, big juicy plot hooks for the players to pick up, and at least a vague sense of where things would end up.  And the game proceeded generally how I envisioned it might.  But there were several side plots and plot enhancements that came as much as a surprise to me as to the players, though again I would be the one to think of them first, and then present them to the players next.  But these additions were responses to player actions, if not player input-into-the-plot.<br/><br/>To be a bit more specific:<br/><br/>In the first campaign, the characters all had their own reasons for following this NPC, who I knew was up to no good, but exactly what that nogoodness was, I didn't know.  As they explored in certain directions, they found out certain things--he had bought climbing equipment before he left; he knew about this other imprisoned NPC and probably wanted to free him.  Thinking about the plot between episodes, I came up with the reason why--he was going to sneak up a cliff to a castle to assassinate the queen, and sister to the imprisoned NPC, to install him as king in her place.  The players didn't decide anything to do with that, but at one point they said, "I check around to see what he bought before he left!" and I said, "Uh, climbing equipment!" thinking of one thing he could do with that, and then later thinking of something even better.  I didn't know how, when, or even if they'd be able to thwart these plans, but I figured they'd probably be able to, and after I had the idea of scaling a cliff, I thought a cliff would be a great place to have a big climactic battle.  And indeed, it was so.<br/><br/>In the second campaign, at one point the characters asked an NPC if he had any stories from the area, so I had the guy tell them a story about the 'snow maidens and snow youths'--monsters from the setting that held dances in the woods where they would try to entice humans to join them only to freeze to death.  At that point, it was just setting detail they hadn't come across yet, so I was just tossing things out there.  Then later that session they were investigating something out on a mountain, things were drawing to a close, and I thought, "Hmm, things are slow--I should push them back to the village so we can wrap this up," and had them hear the sound of drums, thinking they'd connect this to the tale of the monsters from earlier, say 'yikes' and head back.  But, of course, they were feeling invulnerable and decided to go investigate.  And what followed was probably the most fun scene we had the entire campaign.  There was dancing and information exchanges and seduction and a final dancing competition and the whole thing was just a riot.  And from then on, I started looking for ways to incorporate the 'snow people' into the plot, gave them a whole culture and history of their own, and even fostered a budding romance between a player and the snow maiden who had tried to seduce and kill him in that first encounter.<br/><br/>My basic premise is that players who play 'through their characters' (which is our group's preferred mode of play) want two things that the GM can provide:  they want to make a difference in the game world, and they want to put their personal stamp on the game world.  These do not have to be the same things.  The 'making a difference' bit is the plot, but they're fine with the GM making that part up--that doesn't have to be the bit they put their personal stamp on.  But as the GM, it's part of my job to watch for ways the PCs can personalize the world through their actions, too, in ways that may or may not have anything to do with the 'plot' per se.  And if I *can* put their personal stamp on the plot, so much the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102141/#Comment_102141" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T23:18:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:18PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in the day, I ran a psuedo-Dark Ages German-Celtic game (accent on psuedo) in which the PCs were all kids from the same village. I was definitely the source of plot, but I didn't rail road or use too much illusionism. I created maps of the village and surrounding areas and a ruined tower with an orc hole in the bottom of it. I pregenned some PCs for the players to pick from so that they'd have an interesting mix.  One PC was 'touched by the otherworld', so he had visions and hidden magical talents, but also might go into an epileptic fit during times of stress. Another was destined to be high king (yeah, a touch of The Belgeriad). They picked characters and then I set the opening scene with them out in the fields fetching hay and mud to make repairs to their long houses, when they see flames from their village. A band of raiders had swept in, killed some menfolk and stolen some of their women. They fought a few stragglers as the main group left in longboats. The PCs took off after them in some corracles that they used to catch fish. They track these folks to their HQ, free the women and find a box holding a letter about invasion plans and a map and the head of some hideous creature (its an orc, but they don't know from orcs) and off they went following where the map led and taking on the orc outpost.<br/><br/>I never said you have to do x, or you can't do y. But I would have been surprised if they went off somewhere else, mostly because I knew who I was playing with. Had they wanted to sideline the game, it would have made things harder and potentially unfun, but they could have done it.<br/><br/>John, I'm curious how you avoided GM Makes the Plot type gaming as that was basically what a GM did during play when I started out. I really didn't know there was anything else until I stumbled into a local convention a couple years ago just to see if gaming was still as fun as I remembered (it was Orccon in Los Angeles and it was a conversation with Paul Tevis about some weird game about gunslingers where you escalate from talking to fighting to gunplay and there's this fallout thing that leads to experience...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102145/#Comment_102145" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T23:51:30+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 11:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2007 11:55PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>John, I'm curious how you avoided GM Makes the Plot type gaming as that was basically what a GM did during play when I started out.</blockquote>\nI just stumbled into it. I <i>tried</i> to pre-plan a game, back when I first started GMing in the 80s. I had a whole big campaign planned. It wasn't scripted, exactly (the way Matt Snyder described), but I definitely had a plan in my head for how it would go.<br/><br/>Then, after I dumped the big hook in front of the players, they just looked at it and said, "Yeah... we don't really want to do that. We leave. Oh! Let's go south. There's a cool jungle nation down there." And they did. They just ran off to pursue their own agendas. I didn't know I even had the <i>option</i> to railroad them back into my story, so I ran after them, trying to catch up.<br/><br/>I played with those guys exclusively for a long time, so I never had the opportunity to do it any other way. The games were Player-driven, with the dial at 11, pretty much from day one of my GMing career. I am so, so glad it went down that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102150/#Comment_102150" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T01:59:44+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  1:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I'm a bit confused by those who were disappointed with GUMSHOE.

I write my games to be linear at the beginning, moderately linear at the end (in that they usually lead to an anticipated big climax), and totally open to different strategies in the middle. It seems to work pretty well; it allows free choice for most of the game, and still delivers a cool finish.</blockquote>\nThis seems to be basically what Malcolm and Mike, etc have been talking about as a common, GM-driven style of play.<br/><br/>Well, the trouble is that it's neither "GM-driven" nor has the attributes Piratecat's talking about, as far as it relates to my experience. Part of this is that I run multi-session, episodes/chapters for the most part and not convention games, so I don't have any particular conclusion in mind when I sketch out things for the group. I improvise based on the world. What is common is that the players themselves identify a structure and I support that.<br/><br/>For instance, my last Star Wars session bean with the traditional, in media res thing were the PCs' ship was being chased over Coruscant. The starting structure was that, barring something extremely clever, they had to stick around Coruscant as they were low on fuel and navigable points were blockaded by the brand-spanking new Empire. They set down and explored various options:<br/><br/>* Going to the Jedi Temple. They decided against this after finding out Jocasta Nu was dead and it was likely occupied.<br/>* Finding passage out. This was practical if they did a bit of work but ultimately the smuggler didn't want to leave the ship behind.<br/>* Refuel and find a way out of the system. This is what they decided on. I introduced an underground community I'd sketched out that could help them out, but who wanted some help in return. I knew they'd need a hideout at some point, so I designed that community to serve for any such scenes. They wanted that kind of scene off the bat.<br/><br/>Now there's some stuff going on. Luke and Leia died in childbirth and the Emperor is pumping out evil clones of them to serve as his enforcers. There's a holocron hidden in the Jedi Temple that has the location of the true Sith homeworld, where the Sith species were put into stasis thousands of years ago. Aliens and other refugee groups are hiding in Coruscant's lower depths to hide and are being preyed upon by the crime lords who originally set up there. In general, there's all the stuff that happened between Eps III and IV. That last point allows me to tell one of the Jedi that the Force tells him Jocasta Nu is dead. It was part of the set of facts about the world floating around. It is not a plot because the events that led to that aren't something we explored in play, nor do I have any specific vision about how she died. She's just dead.<br/><br/>There *might* by a Force-mindwiped true Sith, sent by Yoda to help the PCs. There *might* be former ARCs hiding in regular clone units who the ARC PC can contact. There *might* be a rogue Skywalker clone. There might be a lot of guys.<br/><br/>At this point I am nowhere *near* linearity. I do have some scenarios in my head. I think it might be cool to have an epic where it's Vader leading clones of his dead children against a reformed true Sith army commanded by the PCs. No idea how we might get there, though. It's a daydream. Maybe the PCs will find a way to awaken the human characteristics of the Skywalker clones and redeem Vader. Dunno. I don't know if Vader even *knows* where the clones come from.<br/><br/>I'm confident that the vague waveforms of this stuff will collapse into a plot depending on the PCs decisions. I certainly have a lot of influence because I determine the global response to those decisions, but very few of them are meaningless or have discrete plot coupons attached. There's no set ending. A set start, certainly, and a place where my sketches run out, but I figure I'll have new stuff by then. There are some practical strictures on decisions. They're not ready for Vader yet and can't casually leave Coruscant.<br/><br/>Now SWSaga is very helpful in two ways. There's a huge background, and prefab stat blocks in the book and online. If you want to know why anybody would go for metaplot and descriptions of other people's cool characters, now you know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102168/#Comment_102168" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T04:35:50+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  4:35AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Graham's comments suggest that it suffers from the "designer not included" problem that some games have, which is possible.</blockquote>\nYeah.

But what I can say, Malcolm, is that the methodology that you describe is rare in my experience. It's usually the purview of GMs who have a lot of experience and really good instincts. Enough so that it's been vanishingly rare in my experience, outside using RPGs that actually instruct you to use these techniques. To whit, repeating my experience, I personally never used them through 25 years of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI *was* that illusionist guy who was always making my plot play out. And so was everybody else I played with. That's not saying that folks like you didn't exist out there. But, as somebody else said, I probably assumed that if I was playing in a game that they ran, that they were using illusionist technique to hit a designated end. I would have been flabbergasted to learn that any cool ending to a game had come about just through interactive play. Wouldn't have though that possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not a particularly sound assumption, but it's what I and most people were taught. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider what Buzz is talking about. If ever I didn't railroad folks secretly, it was during early D&amp;D. The first generation of modules for D&amp;D were not at all plotted. The only "Force" being used by the GM was basically proposing playing the module in question. "Want to play the Steading of the Hill Giant Chief?" I'd ask, and then we'd start at the entrance with location #1. And from then on it was open play constrained to the limits of the module only. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's only later that Buzz's module shows up, with it's embedded illusionism. Why? Well, we get AD&amp;D1E, and there's Gygax filling our heads with ideas that the game can be about actually playing characters. I recall it actually dawning on me one day reading some Dragon Magazine article that some people actually paid attention to their characters' desires and such, and "role-played" (as opposed to "roll-playing")!<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, new vistas open. Let's try to play this way. And we try, using those first generation modules. And it's clearly not working, people are stil "roll-playing." What could we be doing wrong? Ah, clearly the scenario is all about killing stuff. All we have to do is change the module so that it's about things are more like a story. Because if it's like that, then the players will actuall have their characters act in a believable fashion, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, that was a really bad assumption, but it's the one that absolutely everyone made. The systems that came out at that time were functionally identical to D&amp;D in this respect, and the way that people sought to fix the problem was through moving from "modules" (which were clearly wargaming scenarii), to "Adventures." I can recall the resistance to that paradigm shift. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what do you put in a module? Well, what sort of story do we want to make to have the PCs be role-played inside? Something Tolkienesque... after all that's what we've been after all these years. How do I get that to happen. Well, I have a dark lord with a plot, and then I have the characters given a chance to thwart him and... <br/>\n<br/>\nWait, can't we just let the players create the action? Why have adventures at all? We try this, but it fails miserably. Why? Because players are idiots (we assume, incorrectly), whenever presented with baby kobolds they kill them and then tell us "Well they weren't worth any EXP alive." They must be mentally deficient. We have to program the "adventure" to ensure that the action produces something like a "Story." <br/>\n<br/>\nHow did it work in the modules? Oh, yes, there's a chain of "encounters"... let's do away with that and call them "scenes" since many of them won't be about combat. And then all we have to do is to explain how it is that the PCs get from scene to scene, and... Viola! <br/>\n<br/>\nRole-playing!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's easy to see the pitfalls looking back on it, or how we should have known better. But there they were, the pros, producing these adventures that use a voice that says that "The PCs do this" and assume "When the PCs do that." So then there are a bejillion Dragon articles about what to do when the PCs go off of the rout of your planned adventure. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that's right, don't pay any heed to what the players think is cool as a direction in which to go, you've spent time preparing the adventure, "winging it" is only for the most creative and talented of GMs, so don't even try it. Best to figure out how to get the PCs back onto the path to adventure so that you can ensure that your preparation doesn't go to waste. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, it took hours to stat up those orcs... what, you're going to do it in the middle of the game and slow things down? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt never occured to us that if you didn't have to stat up the orcs that you could "wing it" much more easily. The reason that play wasn't about role-playing is that the systems all had reward cycles that promoted killing things and taking their stuff. Oh, sure, D&amp;D2E gives us the "role-playing" reward. But the rest of the entirity of the system is screaming "Your best and most interesting rout to EXP is via combat." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe players weren't idiots, it turns out, they were playing the system that was presented to them. It turns out that there's no requirement to railroad players through a plot, with the right system players will create plot themselves. What we always wanted, but couldn't seem to get using those earlier systems. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut few have seen that this can work. Most RPG players are blissfully unaware that systems exist that might actually promote this sort of play. Of those that are aware of the existence of such games, many are skeptical. They've tried allowing players to create plot, but it hasn't worked for them. System Doesn't Matter, they say, all RPGs play the same, and it's only the GM that matters. Only he can make the difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he'll do that by forcing the players to "role-play." Kicking and screaming if he has to do so. And he'll do that via an "adventure" that he's cleverly devised. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first text that I know of that actually says something advice-wise that matches the sort of play that you're talking about, Malcolm, would be Skarka's Underworld (with the concept of "Intuitive Continuity"). Yes, games like Over the Edge hint at this methodology earlier, but look at the published adventures! Everway too. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the conclusion of this article by John Kim, about the "fasion trends" for RPGs: http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/fashions.html<br/>\n<br/>\n[quote]While the problem of "railroaded" adventures is old news to many role-players, it seems clear that the industry is still struggling with finding a solution to it. How do you provide effective support for running adventures without laying out a plot to follow?[/quote]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is so common, that for you to think that the way that you're describing play is "common" boggles my mind Malcolm. But, then, it could simply be that we play in different segments of the community or something (though you'd think that our convention experiences over dozens of GenCons would have some correlation). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing is incontrovertibly true. For me (and I don't think I'm rare), it was the discovery of systems that promote the method of play in general that lead me out of the wilderness to play that is, apparently, more like yours. "You could do it with other systems" just isn't true... I tried for 25 years. Sure, now I know he techniques, and could play D&amp;D using them. But why would I want to have to fight the system to get what I want (considering that there's no baby in my bathwater)? <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that some of this personal revelation can help create some understanding here between those of us who like games that promote player creation of plot more directly, versus those who do it with more traditional systems. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102201/#Comment_102201" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T07:43:40+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  7:43AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it worth noting (unless it has been already) that the common "plotted" adventure model has a lot to do with the nature of game publishing? I mean, the very nature of a product like <i>Eyes of the Lich Queen</i> or the big adventure path products Paizo does assumes that the PCs somehow make it from the events in chapter 1 to the beginning of chapter 2. The alternative is to publish a really, really big dungeon, i.e., one very large situation.<br/><br/>Otherwise, what kind of book can you publish? Something like <i>The Gift</i> for BWr? I.e., eight pages of notes and then a bunch of pregens that <i>must</i> be used for the scenario to work? Who's going to pay for that?<br/><br/>(Some exceptions might exist. Some people have mentioned a 'Big Book of Towns" for DitV, which seems do-able.)<br/><br/>So, if these products are the primary example GMs have to work from (since most RPGs until recently are typically devoid of good examples and practical procedures), why wouldn't gamers tend to think that this is how you do it?<br/><br/>E.g., I'd argue that HERO works fine in "plotless" mode, especially as implemented in <i>Champions</i>. Armed with one of the many fat books of villains and maybe a setting book for the PCs home town, you can Bang and Kicker all night long. However, I don't think I've ever seen a published adventure for Champs do this, nor does the GM advice in the rulebook advocate anything of the kind. Quite the opposite, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102218/#Comment_102218" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T08:16:55+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  8:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 8:17AM by Malcolm Sheppard.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scripted scenarios are, IMO as a guy who writes them, meant to be something the GM enters into a dialectic with. In OtE there are scripted adventures, but you're still in Al-Amarja and doing general stuff; the rest of the city doesn't dissolve. In a bigger campaign adaptation is important. Unfortunately, GMing advice is generally terrible. I've tried to change that in my recent work (see the upcoming Astral Realms for Mage), making it more about structured craft, but I haven't had a chance to apply it to an adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102222/#Comment_102222" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T08:50:10+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  8:50AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is my first post here, prompted by this fascinating thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n[quote]Many years ago, I formulated the problem for myself thus: I must somehow write a plot that leaves the main characters out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was never able to solve this problem in a way that satisfied me completely, and I reckon I've tried every variation mentioned in this thread and then some.[/quote]<br/>\n<br/>\nI *think* I have a found a comfortable way of doing this.  I write the "plot" of the opposition.  The perfect plan if all goes accordingly.  For the villain.  Then count on the players to screw with that plan somehow, sometimes by merely showing up in town.<br/>\n<br/>\n So the prep work I do is primarily figuring out the resources, the personality of bad guy(s), and their relationships in a fairly sketchy web.  Then I do give some thought to how to open the session, often by getting information into the hands of the PCs as fast as I possibly can.  Or maybe the intersection of bad guy's plan and PCs is a better way of putting it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly Hitchcock can point a easy way of doing this in "the Man Who Knew Too Much", where the mule/courier walks up to innocent american couple and dies in their arms, passing on the "macguffin".  Now, the villain(s) have to react to this and start to harry Jimmie Stewart and Doris Day.  This is Kicking in the door pretty hard... and it works... I've done it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe because I just read Tarzan the Invincible (#14) on a lark, that I'm in a bit of a pulpy adventure mood... but how many times does some nubile princess come running out the jungle, looking all terrified,  towards Conan or Tarzan?   And this launches the adventure...as bad guys want princess back... or princess is the bad guy etc. etc.  Funny, despite almost 3 decades of RPGIng, this cliche has never happened to one of my characters... sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I see it as my job to delineate why that princess is running around in the jungle fearing for her life.  It isn't so much plot... as it is background and framework for the PCs to create the plot as we go along in our session of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy prep really varies from session to session by the way.  Sometimes its just a show-up and play with some thoughts rattling in my head.  Sometimes, like in a mystery-investigation storyline, I tend to put quite a bit of work in.  I had a very successful, fantasy cops-pulp cult-murder mystery adventure a while back, because 90% of my prep was not creating a lot of clues, but coming up with several ways I could get those clues into the hands of the players AS FAST AS I COULD.  The players still came up with additional ways of retrieving information by opening up a line of questioning of an NPC that I made up on the spot for them on their request, yet was perfectly reasonable NPC to have appear.  So, here was a kinda melding of Traditional-Story Game in the very same session.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yeah, the above paragraph reinforces my feelings on the matter.  I didn't write out the plot of that session.  Sure, I had a murder, a cult smuggling illegal substances, a rich upper class society partaking of that substance and a lot of competing motivations by NPCs, and one red herring.... but that was the background frame work.  THE Plot was my two cops, working in a city they were new to, unraveling this byzantine muddle.  The drugs, in play, became a much bigger deal, than the murder.  The murder they solved about 1/2 way through.  The drug interdiction was the action set piece (although the location was made up organically through play... this wasn't predetermined by me).<br/>\n<br/>\nGMs don't write plot.  They write structure.  We are directors more than screen writers.  We work from a LOOSE script to be sure, but that is filtered through actors, sets, and timing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102228/#Comment_102228" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T09:20:56+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  9:20AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 9:22AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following up on Storn's ideas, for a long time now, I've thought of preparation for play as "Situation Grabs PCs." It could be a villain's plot. It could be a relationship map. It could be some central conflict that's going on. A number of ways exist to construct situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is how the PCs fit in. You don't want the PCs to end up outside of the action, just watchning it. Storn's example of "the Man Who Knew Too Much" is a good approach, that ensures that the PCs will be embroiled. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's usually used, however, is the "hook." And this is usually no good. Because a "hook" assumes a certain response by the player. It's seeming to give them a choice, but not really. Classic reduction of player agency. As with my example of playing a module, you're far, far better off just getting player buy-in out of character. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Tonight the game is going to be about this mystery, cool?" As opposed to, "This guy comes to you and asks you to solve a mystery for him." The latter is asking for a formality of the player saying yes, while presenting it as a potential question like "Do you want to work for this guy?" It makes an assumption about what the player will do, and hopes that plausibility will work to cause this. What hard-boiled detective could resist the man's offer of cash? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it turns out that even if the player would have played it this way, that a false offer of a choice still feels like GM control of character. The player feels, "Why did you force me to make this choice in this scene, if you already knew the outcome?" And it's force, to be sure, because the unstated result of the player saying no to the man is, "Well, then we don't have anything to play tonight." <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter than both the negotiation to play the mystery, or the force, is the "Grab" (to paraphrase ol Ronnie and the idea of Grabbiness). In this case, you create a situation in which no matter what the player decides in impacting the situation, he's involved in a way he'll enjoy. For instance, the "Man Who Knew Too Much" is such a situation. In point of fact, in the movie Jimmy Stewart does "walk away" from the request for help. He's confused, and doesn't understand what's being asked of him, and decides quite realistically to just move on. In this case, however, this sets into motion other problems for the character. No matter what the player would do in a situation like this, he's involved with the plot now. <br/>\n<br/>\nTthe basic technique is to present a situation where no matter what the player does, the rest of the "plot" must respond in some way. There are more subtle ways to go, but they largely involve knowing the PCs before had (problematic for a published adventure). So, let's say that we want to run that mystery in the example. Well, we alter the situation such that if the player says no to the PC, he ends up dead the next day, in a manner that's suspicious in that it relates to what the NPC said in the PCs office the previous day... did the PC have anything to do with causing this man's death in not helping him? The PC can still walk away from this, so the situation then also has to entail the bad-guys who killed the man who asked for the PCs help not finding what they're looking for on the man they killed, so, of course, they come to the PC to find if he knows anything about it. If the PC walks from this, taking his beating, but denying everything straight up, then they go for somebody the PC cares about to force him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you may never get to the mystery. That's OK. Because, as Hitch would say, it's a MacGuffin. The mystery that is implied by the set-up situation is not, and can never be, what play is about. That's not to say that it won't get solved, perhaps it will (almost certainly, in fact). Simply that the important part is the contribution that the player makes through his character. How does the PC respond at each step, and where does that lead the story? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what a grabby situation is all about, something that exists to allow the player to explore their character in the context of the situation. That's not to say that the situation can't be fascinating itself. Just that writing it so that the players serve it's ends, rather than it serving theirs, means that the GM will have to enter that dialectic again to find out how to tame the beast. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102235/#Comment_102235" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T09:49:32+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  9:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 9:49AM by Hexabolic.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I write the "plot" of the opposition.

It sets into motion all kinds of consequences.  I didn't get into this in my first post because I was babbling away ad nauseum about stuff I only 1/2 internalize anyhow.  <br/><br/>But I want players to feel like they can do just about anything, but there will be consequences.  Jimmy Stewart does walk away confused, but like you said, the villains now are trying to actively track him down... here is the consequence.  As a GM, I can react to non-action as much as action.  Of course, the reaction of the villains is going to be different in tone and execution, which is precisely why I game.  I don't KNOW the plot.  I only know some of its parameters.  I don't know HOW the players/PCs are going to react.  I don't want to know.  I usually make some predictions, sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not.  Either way is cool with me.<br/><br/>But how to do this for Publication?  Hmmmm... .that is a rub.<br/><br/>My one suggestion is not the flowchart idea.  And Savage Worlds Evernight/ 50 Fathoms plot points were brought up earlier.  No, not flowcharts, rather more Plug -n- Play situation.  <br/><br/>Why stat up those 20 Orcs in a raiding party?  Because they are there, out on the periphery, waiting to be used.  The raiding party might happen in town, as the Orcs are trying to sell their ill-gotten gains, it could be on the road, it could be an attack on a small village (7 Samurai anyone?)... it doesn't have to be a violent oriented situation... maybe they could be recruited, maybe they are impromptu drinking buddies.  My idea for publication is to make that Raiding Party interesting in so many different ways that it can be used my multiple GMs in multiple situations.  Plug -n- Play.<br/><br/>A suggested way of presentation...<br/><br/>Orc Raiding Party<br/>lead by Ukog, fun loving, out for adventure, type (lets play against type here)<br/>2nd:  Nendar:  Grumpy, loyal to Ukog, cleans Ukog's messes up, perfect sarge.<br/>18 generics.  {<i>insert your game system stats</i>}<br/>Sit 1:  Orcs are flush and blowing cash in town/village/city.  They are open to all kinds of suggestions, as long as it is fun.<br/>Sit 2:  You need some combat in this long overland trek, Raiding party starts shadowing PCs for a couple of days before getting the courage to attack.  Good psych warfare might forestall the raid entirely.  A good 1/2 of them are pretty drunk during the attack, hoping for victory through superior numbers.<br/>Sit 3:  Ukog doesn't want to widdle his people down through attrition, and tries to blackmail the PCs in hiring him as guards for the long trek.  But really, he is going in the same direction anyhow, just wants to get home.  If the PCs work the social angle long enough, Ukog will capitulate and do it for free.<br/>Sit 4:  Ukog and Nendar are captured.  PCs are asked to be on the jury.  Will this be rough frontier justice?  Do the Orcs deserve it?  What is really going on?<br/>Sit 5:  The Orcs have horses, weapons etc and have been successful for the last 6 months or so.  But they need more "civilized" front men to convert horse, weapons, even slaves, into gold.  They might go as far as to capture a favored NPC of the PCs to blackmail the PCs into doing this.<br/><br/>I came up with those 5 situations in about 20 mins.  What I think is cool about published stuff being like this is that someone can look at those 5 optional situations and get a sense not only of the raiding party, but of the designer's intent.  In this case, I'm the designer.  Orcs as generic wandering bad guys is pretty boring to me.  It is my intent to show how a raiding party can be used in social conflict and not necessarily physical violent conflict.  The reader might look at my 5 suggestions and come up with a BETTER one for THEIR TABLE in a heartbeat.  And if the reader spends 3 minutes thinking about it, can probably come up with 3 BETTER situations than any of the ones I suggested.<br/><br/>But by giving 5 different situational ideas, we prompt the reader into being flexible.  Show by doing.  <br/><br/>Next, we are introducing the idea of Plug -n- Play... WHEN is this Raiding Party going to be used?  Don't know.  GM at Table A might use it early.  Table B GM might use it to jumpstart the middle with some action after a lot of social interaction between players.  WHERE does it happen within the game world... we don't know that either... but it can happen in lots of places.<br/><br/>Just some thought-age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102281/#Comment_102281" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T11:49:08+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 11:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2007 12:04PM by Storn.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't mind seeing Sorcerer in action.

I knew it!<br/><br/>Here's the question that all this has brought to my mind: if you, as GM, have the characters "buy in" to a specific situation, does that do anything to make the subsequent game feel more or less controlled by the GM?  <br/><br/>To use specific game examples, if we sit down to play The Mountain Witch, we all know that eventually the Witch will come into play when the PC's reach the top of the mountain.  When we sit down to play the Buffy RPG, we all know, or at least think we know, that the PC's will eventually uncover the machinations of the Big Bad and try to foil them.  Is there a qualitative difference between these two kinds of constraints, or is it just a matter of style?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102307/#Comment_102307" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T13:21:50+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  1:21PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IDK if I can answer that question, but I will point out that earlier <i>players</i> buying into the situation was being discussed.

It would be, perhaps, the difference between the sort of story you tell in an improvisational drama (which can be cool) and in a novel (IMO cooler).<br/><br/>Now roleplaying games are manifestly not novels, but that doesn't mean they can't gain something of narrative direction, coherence and drama from having a plot of some sort to follow. I'm not sure if they do, or what, just a suggestion                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager

post.<br/><br/>The direction and endpoint set up in advance does not have to be created by the GM alone. I've played plenty of games where there was a "plot" to follow -- sometimes obvious and explicit, sometimes unspoken. All of our Pulp Space games, for example, have had very strong plotlines that we followed scrupulously. However, none of those storylines were created by the GM alone, as an exclusive GM job.<br/><br/>I could be wrong about my assumption.

My experience is that story that emerges can definitely have a "direction and endpoint" that it is driving toward. For example, our recent Blossoms are Falling game is focussed on a family that has fallen on hard times and its struggle to win back prestige and honor. We may fail in that endeavor, but we all know what the PCs are going to be pushing for and pushing for hard. Of course, we all created the situation in our first session. All of the beliefs and instincts and traits revolve around the situation. All the characters are tightly wound up in its resolution. While we may not know each scene before they are framed, we do know that we either will or will not bring the family back to its former glory.<br/><br/>By the way, I think we also need to give Storn a big SG welcome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102403/#Comment_102403" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T04:05:33+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  4:05AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2007 4:06AM by elmago79.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Now roleplaying games are manifestly not novels, but that doesn't mean they can't gain something of narrative direction, coherence and drama from having a plot of some sort to follow.

To give the plot coherence, direction and drama those are centered upon one or various themes, that are shown in the actions of the characters. This really has nothing to do with the way a novel is written, but with how it read (the writer may know from the start how it is going to end or may not).<br/><br/>If you have theme, and characters invested in it (like in noclue's example) you're bound to have a more novel-like experience than if you have a pre-planned plot or storyarc. For example, if you've read published scenarios for Vampire The Masquerade you might remember there were some notes about the theme of the scenario, that were supposedly shown in the way the plot was structured. However, in AP a story about loss could turn out to be about nothing specific due to the fact that the actions of the PCs could not enforce the theme or even work against it, and so you had a more chaotic, less oriented experience.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>The direction and endpoint set up in advance does not have to be created by the GM alone.</blockquote>\nI'm going to take this a bit out of context from your post: Players can railroad too.

I have participated in, and GM'd games which were all about improvisation. There was no plot set in advance, just on the fly creation of story as we went along. These were fine, but I have been aware that sometimes when I improvise the result is just not as good as things I have sat down and planned in advance. The names are less cool, the imagery is more stereotypical, the relationships between characters are less complex, the plans of the NPCs are simpler and less cunning, and sometimes simply stupid (because *they* should have been planning in advance, or were smarter than me, or both!), there are often more farcical or stupid elements, because I don't have the chance too look back on my ideas and edit them to something more in keeping with the theme.<br/><br/>Now maybe everyone else is better than this than me, or maybe I'm not always bad, or maybe the pleasure of co-operative and on the fly authorship of the story overwhelms such niggles, but I've still been aware of them as a difference between what happens when I prepare and what happens when I improvise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102468/#Comment_102468" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T10:58:58+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 10:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: I've definitely seen that tendency for improv to lack depth or resort to farce in lieu of dramatic themes.

For reasons I don't remember I was meant to be running a session of a fantasy game (I think it was my own homebrew system of the time) and I had done absolutely no preparation at all, and this was at a time when I carefully prepared everything. The characters were in an inn and I had to make something up. The next thing I knew there was a bar fight, and one of the patrons had turned out to be a demon, and soon people were dead ... characters were dead  and any notion of a continuing story was shot too hell! The whole thing was messed up because I lost it when I was on the spot.<br/><br/>That was the first time that I really realised that when I improvised stuff I was rubbish at it. Over the years I got better, and now I know that even with no preparation I can generally improvise something largely indistinguishable from my average preparation ... but still not as compelling, or exciting, or as image-full as my best preparation.<br/><br/>I notice that the solution of quite a few story games is to constrict the sorts of stories you can tell to a few types (or one) so that the arc and direction of the story becomes a lot clearer even without preparation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102519/#Comment_102519" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T14:26:12+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  2:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to wonder if part if the issue is that, when you're playing a game where only the GM really has room to improvise (i.e., narrative say), you're obviously going to be pretty hit-or-miss unless you're an improv master.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102558/#Comment_102558" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T17:19:20+00:00" title="October 11, 2007  5:19PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps so buzz, but even together you may not develop any improvisational mastery.

But here's where we jump the tracks, when we go to mix-ups and Open play styles. <br/>\n<br/>\nParticipationism is Railroading/Illusionism, only functional. The players are aware that their decisions don't have much effect on what happens, but they're okay with it, and in fact want it that way. They are free to play their characters without having to worry that they make a "wrong" decision which will lead them down a path the GM was unprepared for, or that the GM will have to "save" them from. They just play, interact and follow the cues they're given. The key to such play is trust. They trust the GM to come up with a story they'll enjoy being a part of. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven this is frequently mixed up with elements of Open Play. Most times that I've seen it, the player decisions that have effects are usually during character creation; The player states, explicitly or implicitly, what sort of character they want to play, and the GM crafts a story to give the player the experience they want, within the overarching story. Other times, the player makes a decision, believing themselves to be chasing the GM plot, that is so VERY much cooler than the idea the GM had in mind, and the GM will run with it, rewriting whole swaths of the story to fit. The GM who does this may keep this information to themselves, making them seem like an even more awesome GM than they necessarily are (though the GM who is willing and able to do this IS a better GM than one who is neither), or they may share this with the players, furthering the illusion that player decisions drive play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've enjoyed this sort of play on many occasions, mostly before I had any idea of these concepts, but they're not my preferred method of play. My preference, as both GM and player, is to have active players (or myself) driving the story, putting the GM in a reactionary role, acting to provide adversity to overcome, and emphasis for the important aspects of the characters. A good game where I was largely driving, although following a player-originated storyline, was once utterly turned on it's head when another player entered, grabbed the story by the throat, and told it where it was going. I had to react to the actions of the players, adding grease to the wheels but never having to push or pull to make the story move. I loved it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102704/#Comment_102704" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T10:12:48+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 10:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 10:13AM by komradebob.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even Participationism can be tricky, though, depending upon how you approach it.<br/><br/>"Look, I want to run a dungeon crawl, and I want it to end with a big showdown with a Big Boss type deal, right?

The best indicator of this, when you're not explicit in the way you suggested, is that the players are engaged and enthusiastic about the game, even when it is obviously railroaded to an outsider or to the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102747/#Comment_102747" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T13:19:10+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  1:19PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 1:28PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, if you're saying that there are two forms of play, improv, and pre-planned plot, then... well I could even disagree that pre-planned is better in these cases. But I don't have to. Becuse it's a false dichotomy. <br/>\n<br/>\nI too labored under the belief that you had to have a plot, because otherwise you had nothing to work from, and things tended to fall apart. That there was no third option. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it turns out that you as GM can come to play well-prepared to run the game in a way that's not going to fall apart, but which, in fact, has no pre-prepared plot. You just prepare other stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor one, having lots of good NPCs is an excellent start. Giving them motives and agendas is better. Putting them into conflict with each other, even better than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou should come to play with a "Plot" if that plot means that it's the set up that exists before play. Yeah it's also possible to run good games completely improvisationally... but nobody is suggesting that's better than coming to the game well-prepared. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll I and others might be suggesting is that you do not come with an end-point in mind. Because, frankly, if I wanted to experience a novel, I'd experience a novel. I play RPGs in order to participate in a collaborative endeavor. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting is that, since playing this way, the plots we've had are far, far better than the ones that I had when I pre-planned how things would go. Waaay better. Because we have many authors, not just one. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideal is not to have the GM come and just let the players do whatever they want. Not nearly. Even in improvisational games, we fully expect the GM to have at least an equal role in determining how the story goes, if not a far greater one than any player. The only difference between this and pre-planned plots is that the GM is making up their contribution the same way that the players are, based on what he feels would be cool to have happen next. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my advice, at least, is:<br/>\n1. Come to play without an idea of how the situation will work itself out.<br/>\n2. But have a situation that has to work itself out. <br/>\n3. Work the situation out between you and the players. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll we're advocating, and I think everyone actually agrees in all but precise measure of how much, is that you want to ensure that you're giving your players something entertaining to do. If you're forcing a plot to come out, there's a good chance that you're denying the players an opportunity to participate in a way that they may well enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Lance, as I originally defined the term, Participationism has no illusionism. The GM controls everything quite openly. I posited it as a possible form along an axis opposite from illusionism. <br/>\n<br/>\nEx: <br/>\nGM: "OK, the man wants you to take his quest, you're going, right? <br/>\nPlayers (in pro-forma fashion): "Yup!"<br/>\nGM: "OK you say goodby to him, get your stuff together and head out on the road, and decide to make camp later that night by a stream. The camp is attacked, and one of the characters is dragged off. You give chase..."<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the GM reads a script, and the players just nod and, perhaps, fill in some color at times like dialog (as long as it fits the directions of the script).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102790/#Comment_102790" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T15:11:03+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If that's your definition of the term...

What you're describing in that brief little exchange doesn't seem functional, whereas what I've thought of as Participationism, and what I've seen that fits my conception of the phrase (on many, many occasions) is functional and fun; a valid form of play. There's a D&amp;D campaign that I would dearly love to be a part of that I frequently point to as a exemplary example of the form of play I described above as Participationism. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you coined the phrase, and what I said above aside, I'll stop using it if you're adamant on your original definition, as opposed to my evolution... But either way, I think that's a discussion for another thread.

They know that the published adventure I'm running is railroading them through a plot...because I told them. They are far more interested in letting all those "cut scenes" go by so that we can get to the combats, which is the part they really love.<br/><br/>And I can say that it has been WAY more fun for me than the published adventures we've used where the DM acted as if there wasn't a plot we were being railroaded through. There's no wondering if the the "dinner theater" the DM is presenting might actually be a decision point or just flavor to flesh out the villain (or, more often, let the DM indulge in his acting training).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102849/#Comment_102849" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T21:29:23+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  9:29PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I did this.  I did this hugely, with the game that gave birth to Fate, even: Born to be Kings.<br/><br/>It went on for <a href="http://www.iago.net/amber/kings/sessions.shtml" rel="nofollow">twenty-three well-documented sessions</a> and my players occasionally tell me it was some kind of grail like experience.  I think, to some extent, we keep wanting to figure out how to recreate it.<br/><br/>I definitely, definitely authored the plot here.  But I didn't consider what I authored to be sacrosanct.  Just because I set up a story and put it into motion and had a lot of control over how everything was framed, I gave the players plenty of power to take the plot out behind the shed and sodomize the hell out of it.  I did my level best to return the same in kind with new developments in the plot.<br/><br/>I'm betting that somewhere in there someone might declare "But the GM wasn't writing the plot!" -- Bollocks.  I most certainly was.  Great authors steal, after all; if the players had good ideas, <i>I fucking well stole them</i>.  (So here, John, I'm saying I think it's entirely possible that you've played in games where the GM wrote the plot, but you wouldn't ever call it the GM writing the plot, therefore, it's entirely possible you're using different language than other people are to describe the same thing.)<br/><br/>There's also an element of authorship of setting that I afforded the players that, while not <i>plot-writing</i> on the part of the players, definitely gave me the raw stuff to use when building the plot; I drew a great big map of the land of Amber and put a lot of empty spaces on it with borders around it and then had them tell me what was there.  This gave them a ton of buy-in and control over the setting, but still left the plot in my hands.  To see what they wrought, <a href="http://www.iago.net/amber/kings/atlas.shtml" rel="nofollow">check out the atlas which is full of material they wrote</a> and <a href="http://www.iago.net/amber/kings/map.pdf" rel="nofollow">partially-completed map I made in Illustrator</a>.<br/><br/>I didn't consider the plot to be linear.  I used <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/" rel="nofollow">Personal Brain</a> to create and associate all of the elements in the plot that I had in mind -- think of it as a relationship map, but connecting events as well as people.  I hung MP3s off of those events and always had an appropriate soundtrack if (if; not when) the events ended up happening in the game.  I made on-the-fly changes to the plot when I realized something more interesting was happening in play.<br/><br/>But in the end, as something I had <i>authority</i> over, the plot was mine, as the GM.<br/><br/>Not once was this a case of the players "showing up to be entertained by the show the GM puts on with his NPCs".  I think that's a pretty myopic way of looking at it; I think that's <i>only</i> true when the GM's being a dick -- i.e., when he's not using his authority over the plot to <i>include the players</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102871/#Comment_102871" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T05:03:05+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  5:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for as being a tradional GM goes there are different ways to go about it, but all of them have some common elelments.

I might prepare a few plausible scenes in addition, with no assumption that they would ever see play, but I wouldn't be scripting out what I expected people to do.<br/><br/>But I don't think this suggestion answers my question. Even if I only plot out a number of NPCs and their motives I am still assuming that the players will actually interact with these NPCs. In a totally player led and plotless game there is no way I can make that assumption. They can just walk away from any background I have prepared and do something else, and then we are back to improvisation.<br/><br/>Now I find that players don't generally do that, except out of spite, because they know they are playing a game and they make allowances for that. They *could* walk away from the King's plea to rescue his daughter and become the owners of a floating brothel in another country ... but they don't because they understand that know that there is a game, with a setting, and a story direction, and that it just won't be as good if they do. (Or that it *might* not be as good). At the very least they check to see if leaving to buy their floating brothel is going to give the GM a breakdown ... and if not they may be nice and give him a little while to do some *new* preparation.<br/><br/>Basically its a play contract to accept some element of plot direction and railroading so that you can actually play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102909/#Comment_102909" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-13T14:03:02+00:00" title="October 13, 2007  2:03PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>In a totally player led and plotless game there is no way I can make that assumption.</blockquote>\nRPGs that use some sort of flag mechanics for players helps mitigate this, like, a *lot*.<br/><br/>Otherwise, yeah, it can happen, especially if you're flying blind when doing your prep.

I think the difference here is that we agree, to help out the poor overworked GM, to certain limitations ahead of play, and ask the players to construct characters that will work within that situation, but don't constrain the direction they take it in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103016/#Comment_103016" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T14:38:35+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  2:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2007 2:40PM by iago.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>Sweet!

But if it's important to you, then go ahead, do what you will. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe term isn't important. What is important, which you're missing, is that the terms were created to delineate between games where the GM was controling the plot and trying to hide it, and games where the GM was controlling the plot, and not trying to hide it. My example is extreme just to make the point... actual participationism could include a lot more participation. But the key is that the players would know openly that they had no control over where things were going and that the GM could, at any time, do whatever he needed openly to get the plot going where he needs it to go. That includes controlling the PCs at times, because, frankly, that's neccessary to full plot control done in the open. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they're using any illusionism, then it falls into the category of illusionism. It's as simple as that, under my definition. [Edit: since it's a spectrum, you can have some play that's hidden, and some that's not, and you could say that your play is somewhere in between on this line... that's part of the model too]<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, when I postulated Participationism, I did it because somebody had said that they played this way, and that they thought it was functional. Even like in my example. If you don't think that's a functional form of play, you're welcome to your opinion, and I would agree with you that I would hate to play that way. But that's just how you and I feel, and if we tell these theoretical people that their form of play is wrong, that's us being fascists, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, I can't actually confirm after the fact that the reported sort of play actually occurs, or that the people playing it like it. But as a part of the potential spectra, we have to assume such for the model, if only to make what illusionism is understandable. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that there is another spectrum in this model of control that speaks to whether or not the players are actually consenting to the GM's control. If, in fact, the players are not consenting to this form of play that is otherwise GM controlled and out in the open, the play is railroading (as opposed to GM control in secret using illusionism where the players don't want this, which is "Secret Railroading"). Or, put another way, yes, Participationism is "railroading with consent." If that makes any sense, given that the useful meaning of railroading is taking away choice without consent. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can use the term however you like, I'll just have to make up a new one to label my phenomenon, then. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid, you can argue all you like about how the sort of play that I'm describing will play out, but I have literally hundreds of documented sessions of play using these techniques that say otherwise. Once again, you're making a lot of assumptions about the form that just aren't there. But one thing I can tell you simply is that, if you give players fun stuff to respond to, even if you don't have an expectation as to the response, the response will be fun. Players aren't dumb. They only make bad play when they aren't given good material to work from. You don't have to force players to make the right choice in a scene to get a good scene, or to be able to craft the next good scene. Simply ain't so. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103426/#Comment_103426" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T09:13:17+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  9:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How I used to GM back in the day, when I wasn't just reading a module:<br/><br/>1) Come up with a setting with some potentially epic elements<br/><br/>2) Tell players about the setting<br/><br/>3 + 4) Players come up with characters, maybe to specifically fit with some setting element, maybe in isolation from it.  In the same timeframe, I come up with some sort of initial plot-activity to bring the characters together.<br/><br/>5) Notice what the players liked to do, what niches the characters occupied, et., and start crafting more story elements to fit.<br/><br/>6) Repeat 5, ad nauseum.<br/><br/>In some ways, I was trying to tap things like keys, though in a really crude and sometimes unproductive way.  "What made you think I wanted to do X?"  "Because you did Y last week!"  "Wow, I don't even remember Y..."<br/><br/>The problem I ran into, trying to play long-term games, is that things would become character-driven, then a character would just drop out.  The effect was like a wheel falling off a car.  I had developed backstory, NPCs and other stuff concerning ex-Princess Penelope's quest to win back her throne, but Ralph's got a new girlfriend so won't be playing anymore.  Crap.<br/><br/>My best GM moments were on MUSHes, and tending to be crazy, on-the-fly stuff.  I'm playing out plot X with this group over here, and plot Y with this group over here, and it suddenly occurs to me that there's no reason why the hidden menace of each plot can't be the same entity, and then WHAM!  Cross-talk, more involvement of the MUSH as a whole, people crediting me with having thought all this out weeks ago when it was really a sudden, sleep-deprived inspiration.<br/><br/>Sometimes the off-the-cuff stuff would go off in bad directions, though.  Improvising my way into a corner, or worse, a really boring corner.  It could be hard to change direction.  Is there a tool in the kit for, "You know, that whole scene really sucked.  Can we pretend it didn't happen and try something else?"<br/><br/>Another MUSH plus was that players tended to go off on interesting tangents.  I think a lot of it was the medium.  The stillness of a computer screen when no messages are coming through may ahve made some players initiate actions just to fill the blankness.  And there was something about not having a bunch of players <i>looking at me all the time</i><br/>that made creativity a little easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4495/help-me-understand-gm-writes-the-plot/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4495/help-me-understand-gm-writes-the-plot">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4495/help-me-understand-gm-writes-the-plot/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4495/help-me-understand-gm-writes-the-plot/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4495%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4495%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
