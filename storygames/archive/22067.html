                    What do I want combat in D&amp;D to be? I want it to flow conversationally, like Dungeon World. I want it to be fast, intense, chaotic, first-person, and visceral, like the Middle Earth game Silmenume plays. And I want it to have all the mechanical and tactical richness provided by modern D&amp;D.<br/><br/>People talk about action economy in D&amp;D a lot. It basically comes down to, each team has so many opportunities to make progress towards defeating the other team. It makes a fight feel like a team sport, rather than a personal struggle for survival; and it makes people feel that not spending their currency to contribute to the overall effort as efficiently as possible == sub-optimal &amp; ineffective.<br/><br/>Here's a rough attempt.
<h2>Spotlight</h2>
Instead of rounds and initiative, have the spotlight move with the conversation. Say what's happening, turn to someone, and ask what they do. Keep going with that thread until you get a natural break point; often one side or the other's gone down, or taken some meaningful damage—or maybe someone else at the table is jumping up and down waiting to tell you what <i>they're</i> doing now!<br/><br/>When you can, move the spotlight to whoever's been most quiet or acted least recently.<br/><br/>Sometimes you'll spotlight an individual, sometimes a small group of characters. Occasionally the whole party. You might try to spotlight one person, but it'll end up naturally that someone else, or a slightly larger group, is the focus of action.<br/><br/><small>GM: Around the corner come three orcs and behind them, in chains, a cave troll. They're as surprised to see you as you are to see them! A, you're in the front, what do you do?<br/>A: Rush to meet them in melee!<br/>B: Me too! Nobody's getting past us!</small>
<h2>Reciprocity</h2>
When a player says what their character does, the GM says how enemies respond in turn. Often one PC to one enemy, but not necessarily! If you're surrounded by foes, when you do something, maybe all or several of them respond. Or vice versa. However many foes react, it should be enemies who are directly engaging with the spotlighted PCs, or maybe using the conspicuous respite granted by the PCs' attention elsewhere to do the something important.<br/><br/>In general, however much "action" the PC uses, that's the amount of "action" the opponent responds with. In general, move for move, attack routine / spell / etc for attack routine / spell / etc... with bonus actions really being bonus!<br/><br/><small>GM: As ya'll charge down the corridor, the troll and two of the orcs scramble to meet you!</small>
<h2>Exchanges and Bouts</h2>
Exchanges trade melee attack routine for melee attack routine, among everyone in a melee group! You can give up your attacks to disengage or dodge, or use some spell or special ability that basically amounts to a melee attack, but nothing else.<br/><br/>In a bout of melee, the GM will usually call for 2-3 exchanges in a row! If one side wants to withdraw and the other doesn't, they're gonna have to sacrifice their attack routine in a bout to Disengage, unless they can do it as a bonus action or whatever.<br/><br/>By a melee group, I mean a scrum where at most one of the sides has multiple combatants. So 1v1, or a PC and the foes that surround him, or a group of PCs surrounding their victim.<br/><br/>Let's call attack rolls maneuver rolls instead, here. You can choose to apply your damage from each maneuver as you roll it, or you can lump everything from a whole exchange or bout into one hit, at the end of the exchange or bout, whatever you like. Errol Flynn style fence-fence-fence-fence-STAB! Or bloody, gory hack, hack, hack.<br/><br/>Between exchanges, players should do stuff! Like try to wrestle, outmaneuver, whatever. This is where to try to grapple or disarm or push or shove or trip your enemy, or force them over to the bridge and fling them over the edge. If you try something and your opponent wins, they get to do something of equal-ish nastiness to you, instead. If nobody quickly jumps in with something they want between exchanges, the GM will just ask for a flat d20 roll. Natural 1s and 20s between exchanges are chances for the GM to apply the chaos of battle. People trip. Mounts rear and throw their riders. Blades shatter. Shields splinter. Quivers spill. Morale gives way.<br/><br/>At the end of a bout, combatants push away from each other, stumble back, have a bit of a space to breathe.<br/><br/><small>GM: A, throw an exchange against the troll, AC 15! (dice clatter). He's holding 18 damage over you.<br/>A: Fuck, nothing. I want to scramble on his back where he can't reach me!<br/>GM: Your Acrobatics against his Athletics! 19!<br/>A: 14! Fuck!<br/>GM: He plucks you off, throws you to the ground, and pins you there with his foot! You're prone and restrained! Roll another bout, at disad! (more dice clatter)<br/>A: Miss and a hit! Spending a superiority die for Pushing Attack. 19 damage and I throw him off me!<br/>GM: He lands another claw. You take 29 total from the bout.<br/></small>
<h2>Volleys</h2>
When the GM calls for a volley, PCs and their enemies in the spotlight sling spells and arrows at one another. Usually an exchange of ranged attack routines, with the option to give up your attacks to dodge or run for cover or cast a spell or whatever.<br/><br/>If you're smart and lucky, you might be able to get a volley unopposed: All the enemies are busy fighting your friends, nobody's trying to feather you in turn. If you're so free, and the action's been off you for a while, the GM might grant multiple sets of your ranged attack routine.<br/><br/>We'll call attack rolls aim rolls instead, here. If you like, each aim roll can be an individual arrow. Or you can bundle it all in to a single, deadly shot.<br/><br/>At the end of an exchange of melee, if there are unopposed enemies, they might get free volleys if nobody's trying to deal with them. Uh-oh!
<h2>What's my Speed good for?</h2>
When lines of battle are forming, faster characters or monsters get to choose who engages with whom. They get to shape the initial melee groups. Maybe you can Dash in order to choose your foe, forfeiting your first exchange in the bout of melee.
<h2>The Action Economy is Grist for the Mill</h2>
Of deciding what's "fair" reciprocity. But it's not the iron-clad law. Some characters may end up with more actions total, but likely because they're fighting for their lives, not mowing down all the opposition.<br/><br/>This is getting long. And I want to see what all these mysterious comments to the as yet nonexistant post are.                </div>

In DW, (and in the OSR game Epées &amp; Sorcellerie) there is Hack-and-slash. (Btw one idea I've experimented with—unlike my group social experiments downthread [wow, the life-changing magic of cataphoric reference enabled by post-editing] this was in a computer sim though] is that the hero makes one roll vs the moster's AC; the d20 + mod tells us whether or not the hero hit the monster (over AC means hit); the singles digit on the d20 tells us whether the monster hit the hero. (You'd want a lookup table of monster manual to-hit bonuses cross-referenced with hero ACs, for example +4 vs 15 means the hero needs to have a singles digit )of 6 or higher to avoid being hit)).<br/><br/>Kutulu (also mentioned downthread) has the idea that you can only defend against one enemy. Which makes the combat situation have incredible coldness; if you attack, you can't defend. If you are attacked, you can defend… ONCE. Against one of the enemies you are attacked by.

This implies that the problem I had was that the "many-actions-taker" would be powerful or defeat many monsters. That wasn't the case. The problem was spotlight time. The "conversation" is not enough. Just look at that Dungeon World guide that the SA goons did (I really really hate SA but… this is a well-known PDF guide) and the examples in it. Count up how unfairly the spotlight is being distributed in this oh-so-natural conversation flow.<br/><br/>For 5e, the math econ thing is easy (my singles-digit-hack being just a toy) if powerlevel is your only concern;<br/>whenever a hero takes an action, the resolution of that action also includes an amount of actions by monsters by this formula:<br/><br/>[amount of heroes]:[amount of monsters].<br/><br/>For example, two heroes, eight monsters: whenever a hero (either of the two heroes) takes an action, four of the monsters also act.<br/><br/>Four heroes two monsters: every <i>second</i> time a hero acts, a monster acts.<br/><br/>With this you can use the same CR/matchup math as you're used to.<br/><br/>The monster actions need to be part of the resolution so that the heroes just don't fast-talk the DM.<br/>But, as I note downthread, the problem isn't the monsters getting fast-talked, it's the heroes fast-talking <i>each other</i>.                        </div>

                            IME (several tests with data) what happened was that loud-talky-guy got to do a lot more than shy-mousy-girl (not to generalize about gender, that's just what accidentally happened in the several groups where I've tried this with no overlap of players between groups.).<br/><br/>As an experiment, run a game like w/o the action economy but make a note every time someone uses something that would've cost an action, a bonus action, or a reaction [note the three types separately].<br/><br/>BTW everytime I did this, loud-talky-guy that did the most actions? He was under the impression that he talked *less* that everyone else, always impatient that his actions weren't resolved or addressed while in the actual fact he was given <i>more</i> attention and his actions were addressed <i>more</i> often, and more promptly.<br/><br/>What I do in my game is that I don't have a turn order, it's just a chaos, but since I keep track of the action econ, I can correct it when someone is doing more actions than someone else. Thanks to Mikael Bergström for cluing me into this technique in his wonderful game Kutulu.                        </div>

                            But just dotting alone misses the point! Maybe I should explain better. In no-initiative-order-but-you've-still-got-rounds 2097th Edition D&amp;D, I still have these concerns:
<ul>
<li><b>OPPORTUNITY COST:</b> If I don't use my actions as efficiently as possible, I'm being a big dummy. Trying interesting stuff is usually identical to poor tactics.</li>
<li><b>TEAM SPORT:</b> I'm still thinking globally, like what play can I make that's best for the team? I want a little bit of that, but to really force that first-person perspective with some more continuity over time. Rather than, "John, what's this one thing you do? Judy, what's one thing you do?" I'll be all like, "John, what do you do? And then the orc does this, what do you do next? And next? Looks like you're in a tough spot—Judy, what do you do?"</li>
<li><b>TIME IS RIGID:</b> I think I also wanna get very very far away from the idea that "one round is X amount of time." I want stuff to sometimes all happen in a rush, sometimes have lots of circling and waiting for an opening and just surviving and clearing your head. Rounds make this really hard... you have this big epic fight and then, "ok, so 36 seconds later...."</li>
</ul>
I don't think I really want to totally toss the action economy. I still want two things:<br/><br/>(1) Spotlight parity between players, you're 100% to bring this up as a major issue <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/><br/><br/>(2) Action parity between whoever's in the spotlight and the enemies they're immediately concerned with.                        </div>

                            The fundamental mechanical reason for why D&amp;D has an action economy (that is, more actions = more success) is that each action is worth a number of enemy HP in the form of the attack you make. If you want to get rid of the action economy and make it so players don't <i>have</i> to take all their actions effectively, you need to change that.<br/><br/>The secondary fundament for why action economy matters is the initiative issue: earlier actions in the fight are more valuable than later ones, and this is all the more true when characters have valuable actions that can actually impact the action economy, such as status effects that lessen the value of the enemy's actions. In the theoretical corner case of two infinite-HP fighters bashing at each other it of course doesn't matter what order the attacks occur - you could have one hit the other ten times and then the reverse, as the combat isn't ending and thus leaving one side unable to take their own turns. The fact that the combat ends at some point makes earlier actions more valuable than the later ones.<br/><br/>There are three common mechanical developments in this regard that I know of:<br/><br/><b>Symmetric actions:</b> If "A hits B" and "B hits A" are essentially the same mechanically, then a player who chooses to forgo an attack is actually also losing an attack opportunity for the opponent. Insofar as the symmetry holds, it doesn't matter who acts and who reacts. Many games that don't have an action economy work on this basis; initiative is more for determining the combat pairings (the attacker chooses who they attack) than for seeing who hits first.<br/><br/><b>Paying for actions:</b> If taking an action costs you something, then that also neutralizes the action economy, as now a player choosing to not act is saving up whatever it is that they would've paid to act. Could be initiative or stamina or even a reverse-payment system of some sort - when you act you get a busyness token that harms you later.<br/><br/><b>False actions:</b> If all actions are not equally valuable, then the action economy doesn't matter, and instead what matters is the conditions that make an action valuable. Many realism-seeking games go this way: you might e.g. wait for the right moment to act, outright wasting actions just to make sure you are in the right place at the right time to take the actually important action. It's also common in drama games: if somebody has been quiet for a while, their next move is more effective for the surprise of their weighting in.<br/><br/>If you want to implement the "symmetric actions" model for modern D&amp;D specifically, the overall simplest way is to say that whenever you attack somebody, that somebody also gets to attack you (a standard action attack, to be specific). If it's a ranged attack, they get to move instead of attacking you (an outright edge for ranged attacks, but that's the simplest approach). Everybody still takes all of their turns. Your attack happens before theirs, so if your attack slays them, they don't get the counter-attack. Mull that over and you'll probably find some corner cases, but generally the math should work out.<br/><br/>If you want to implement the "paying for actions" model, I suspect that the overall simplest way in the relatively complex modern D&amp;D chassis would be the energy gauge approach familiar from video games: have every character start the fight with initiative tokens (a few more for those with more init bonus), and then every time somebody acts, they distribute one token to every other character in the fight. You can't act if you don't have tokens equal to the number of combatants to distribute. If two characters want to act simultaneously, the one with the more tokens gets to execute first. This doesn't <i>really</i> break action economy, but it does make it so that you can pretty much follow the natural action choreography most of the time and let characters act when they feel like it, within certain boundaries.<br/><br/>The "false actions" model doesn't translate into modern D&amp;D in an entirely trivial way, but the basic conceit would probably be something like dividing actions in combat into "minor" and "major" actions: the former can be taken rather freely as reaction to whatever else happens, but their mechanical impact is limited to causing minor damage or minor circumstance bonuses/penalties, or seizing the initiative. When the latter occurs, the character in question gets a "major" action, also known as a traditional turn, after which it's back to minor actions until somebody else succeeds in seizing a major action. The idea is to play a little jockeying sub-game of "minor actions" in between actually mechanically impactful moves. There would presumably be a skilled GM, ensuring that equally active characters using equally inventive tactics almost always end up taking roughly the same number of major actions per combat, plus or minus one. Basically, the more major actions you get, the more of a tactical advantage you have to demonstrate in the minor action jockeying to get one more, until the opponent finally seizes the initiative and takes their own major action.<br/><br/>My treatment here is relatively conservative and constrained because I'm thinking of modern D&amp;D - new school - specifically. There are more radical possibilities for how to arrange combat rounds in this sort of game, but modern D&amp;D is generally speaking so mechanically intensive that you'll have to rejigger the entire system if you go too far. That's why a 5e action economy reformation basically has to end up as a different way to distribute roughly the same number of spell casting opportunities between the combatants. The trick is to find the way that's most intuitive for you, and best helps maintain a fun and vivacious action choreography.<br/> </div>

This, though, certainly an area where 2097e could be improved; it's just so… like, with hack-and-slash in DW, before you know that the MC/GM can do hard moves (including inflicting harm) if you don't act, it's like "wait the monsters only hurt me because i hurt them?"<br/><br/>2097e tries ensures that each front rank hero has a monster to tango with, right? this is for purps of approximating action parity.

                            Eero!

                            This is a bit tangential, but I just want to point out that sometimes people who talk more also talk faster. This is a huge issue for me. I'm very mechanically adept and aware, so whenever I try to be in the player role in D&amp;D or in a similarly strict turn-taking structure, I actually end up with far less spotlight time than people who don't know the rules as well.                        </div>

                            Interesting discussion. It's definitely worth trying.<br/><br/>Two questions for you:<br/><br/>1. Fairly important, I think, is "how do we decide when to move the spotlight?"<br/><br/>For instance, I'm fighting the ogre, and I'm losing badly. I'd much prefer the exchange/whatever to stop, pause, and to move the spotlight to my friend Lucy, who I know can finish of her opponent easily and come over to me.<br/><br/>(As Eero says, the hit point economy in D&amp;D is what creates the necessity for an action economy, so when I'm winning I want my 'exchange' to go along for as long as possible, and when I'm losing I'd rather it end as quickly as possible. Your approach has to manage that somehow.)<br/><br/>2. Exciting, flowing, fast, fluid combat is a great goal! But why in the world would you want to use D&amp;D with that? (Honest question.) Nothing about D&amp;D combat is designed for speed and excitement. Hit points often take away a sense of tension/uncertainty (e.g. I know how much damage a spear does, and I know how many HP I have, so I know I can handle at least three attacks safely), and every roll which results in nothing happening (from missed attack rolls to failed/successful saving throws negating effects to low damage rolls meaning nothing really changes) slows down the flow by creating "empty pacing" or delay without evolving the situation.<br/><br/>So, why not design from scratch, or go with something else?<br/><br/>(Silmenume/Cary's game throws out the rules of D&amp;D combat pretty much altogether to achieve this effect, by the way.)                        </div>

You cut me to the quick! Good question.<br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot over the last few days in terms of handoff points between three, idunno, modes.
<ul><li>AUTHORITY mode: I say whatever the fuck I want! Ish. When I'm the GM framing a scene. When I'm a player saying what my character tries to do.</li>
<li>CONSTRAINED mode: Some mechanic is putting a salient, constraining pressure on what I can validly say. When the GM of Silmenume's game just saw a player roll a 1 or a 20.</li>
<li>DIRECTIVE mode: Some mechanic is mandating that I insert something very specific into the Shared Imagined Space. When it's the troll's turn in initiative order and it needs to take an action, a move, and a bonus action. When Bob failes his save vs. Hold Person and is paralyzed.</li></ul>
I don't 100% know the answer to your question yet, but it's got something to do with inserting a little bit more of the authority and constrained modes, on both the part of the player and GM, into the D&amp;D combat flow, without sacrificing the "realness" or sense of the objective imparted by the directive mode.                        </div>

That is a great question. For me the answer is that rpg systems for master-level play require hellishly complicated cybernetics. Newbies and basic interactions are one thing, but when you up the level of your play, you also require your systems to be quicker, with deeper interfacing, more precision, multitasking, error-correction and other such qualities.<br/><br/>Now, there are many approaches for how to develop these heavy-duty systems, but there is one theoretical tack that the D&amp;D system takes, which happens to actually be relevant here: when building a complex and dynamic SIS that gets used intensely, you start by creating a <i>baseline formalism</i> that gets to handle the overall rough parts of the process, and then deal with <i>emergent complexity</i> on top of that with <i>situational rulings</i>. This is what the D&amp;D combat system does, near flawlessly; we've dealt with various "platonically perfect" treatments of D&amp;D in the past, it can be taken as a given by now that the game's concept actually encompasses a perfect treatment of its topic in this sense.<br/><br/>In practice: D&amp;D's baseline formalism in combat is that everybody in turns gets to deduct HP from each other until only one side is standing; we call it a "round" when everybody's gotten their chance; you can fine-tune the efficacy of any given action up or down by messing with the action check (hit roll) the character makes to find out if they whiff or act each round. This is simple, this is reliable, this does not break. The formalism reaches its tendrils into fundamental tables (so fundamental that they are not actually printed into the rules as themselves), things like "you get about 4 HP per level" and "a sword stroke causes 4 HP of damage" and "10 feet of fall is like a sword stroke" and so on. A GM can internalize this math and this arrangement, and, bestowed with this power, make it utterly trivial to organize a work-flow for dealing with 10 combatants on a side, of differing power levels, each with their own variety of situational weirdness.<br/><br/>Once you have this formalism running as the baseline of your combat procedure, you get to the part where the combat becomes exciting, flowing, fast and fluid: because the baseline formalism is so simple, even-handed and one-dimensional, it is very easy to build emergent complexity on top. Specifically, you can simulate all kinds of events in the fiction with well-known, instinctive knobs that the baseline interface offers you. Slippery ground? -2 to hit for everybody! An explosion? 3d6 damage! Fire resistance? Halve in-coming fire damage! Clever tactics? Attack bonuses for everybody! Reactive action? Take your action now instead of later! Clever stunt? Take two actions instead of one, but both at -2!<br/><br/>D&amp;D specifically doesn't get to the goal line with its base formalism. That formalism is dull, simple-minded, repetitive and inflexible. I think, however, that it is a realistic design goal to make it so that your dance on top of the formalism, the things you do to gild it up in actual play, can well achieve the goal. And it does that specifically because the baseline formalism is so functional in what it does. The formalism doesn't do anything except tell us when somebody goes down in combat, but it also allows us to push modifiers into that process quite freely for everything else that could possibly happen. This is far from trivial, there are rather few games in between D&amp;D (1974) and Hero Wars (2000) that can claim to run on an universal formalism like this. And D&amp;D's is, ironically, the prettier of the two in sheer mechanical simplicity.<br/><br/>I hope that answered the question. I freely admit that this gets into the abstract territory where people's eyes start glazing over.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I don't know, Eero. Perhaps you have a point (if I'm even understanding you correctly; this is one of your less lucid posts, at least for me - perhaps I'm just being dense, though!).<br/><br/>Even if you are right, however, I still maintain that modern D&amp;D isn't built for speed or drama. And Jeph is <i>specifically</i> talking about D&amp;D5e (the edition is specified in the OP's subject line), not some kind of platonic D&amp;D-inspired ideal:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And I want it to have all the mechanical and tactical richness provided by modern D&amp;D.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
There's a lot to consider in running modern D&amp;D "by the book". When I played with a group of relatively veteran players (there was one newbie in the group, admittedly, but everyone else had played for years, and the campaign was a year and a half old), a turn of combat would often take about 30 minutes, and we often had to stop to look up effects and rules in the books (and/or debate them). (I actually kept stats on the timing, and could dig them up, if it matters! But that, in itself, is telling: if I had time to by writing down how long everything took, that says a lot about how unengaging and slow the process was.)<br/><br/>This is not too different in other groups that run 'expert level' D&amp;D5e. <i>Critical Role</i>, for instance, which is made up of people who have been playing the same campaign and the same characters for years, mostly exclusively play not just D&amp;D but specifically 5e, and have a support team helping them look up rules. Despite all that, their combats are typically about an hour long (someone collected stats on this over in the <i>Critical Role</i> thread). Their longest combat was over 3 hours long!<br/><br/>That's not exactly "fast, intense, chaotic, first-person, and visceral".<br/><br/>I get your argument that there is a platonic simplicity about the basic format of D&amp;D combat, but it's not built for any of the terms Jeph used ("fast, intense, chaotic, first-person, and visceral"). And the basic premise has a number of "time-wasting" elements built into it, like the whole "roll to hit" (often creating "dead moments", almost 50% of the time) and separate "roll for damage" (which, again, usually results in no actual action or outcome).<br/><br/>I mean, the whole point of the hit point system is to <i>pace</i> the combat, stretching it out: to keep anyone from making a decisive victory early in the fight, basically. And, furthermore, the whole concept of hit points and tightly bound action economies and damage numbers is about <i>reducing</i> uncertainty and chaos. Giving the players control over tactical decisions as they move turn-by-turn, at a level which never happens in real combat (you can stop to chat with your friend about whether you should use this maneuver or that, for instance). <br/><br/>Strict turn order is <i>all about</i> reducing chaos. Jeph recognizes this, so s/he wants to remove the action economy... but so many other bits and pieces of the system are similarly there to reduce randomness, chaos, and intensity.<br/><br/>Almost any other RPG system seems better suited as a starting point (maybe with the exception of Burning Wheel or Rolemaster, but even the former has D&amp;D beat on the "chaotic" front because of blind action declaration). <br/><br/>What if we slapped down cards at each other or threw tokens at each other? What if I could do everything I need to be ready by the time my turn came around? What if I could act at any time instead of waiting for my turn? What if waited until combat was over to determine the severity of our injuries? How about drawing from a Jenga tower with a ticking timer? <br/><br/>The "Cary spicy dice" game does this very well by removing formalism altogether - combats are incredibly intense and visceral (to the point that some players quit the game because they find it too stressful!), because someone's yelling at you (and sometimes physically miming an attack coming at you!) and you only have, at most, seconds to decide what you will do.                        </div>

                            Well yeah, I obviously agree with you about D&amp;D 5e - that thing's basically never going to become a slim, mean combat engine [grin]. The D&amp;D that does that resembles the '74 text much more than the current edition.<br/><br/>But it's not taking the D&amp;D as your starting point that's the problem there, it's the desire to retain much cruft that is not essential to the concept, nor particularly well-designed for the goal on hand. Much of that goes into modern D&amp;D is massively contrary to the ideal of responsive, exciting combat. You'll need to drop all the petty circumstantial bonuses for one, just to get rid of that whole "did I count all my bonuses" dance, and while 5e seems to have less of those than e.g. 4e, this is basically a case where everything's gotta go if you're ever to get anywhere.<br/><br/>Regarding my argument about D&amp;D's potential, perhaps this helps understand it better: I am arguing that the baseline engine chassis <i>by its very conservative nature</i> allows you to play a more free-wheeling game on top of it without making regrettable decisions that cause unexpected, unworkable consequences. That is: the system being as staid as it is is what allows the players to be zany, inventive and imaginative.<br/><br/>A system with less solid fundamentals would not be able to give us the amount of freedom that D&amp;D does in this regard, while retaining a core structure.<br/><br/>The rules systems you suggest as comparison are either not as nimble as D&amp;D, or they're not capable of actual simulation of a SIS. Obviously you can draw Jenga blocks or flip coins to resolve combats, but how are you going to simulate the differences between a spear and a sword in that system? Is your solution going to make the game rather less nimble than it seemed at first?                        </div>

                            OK so what I'm experimenting with now is separating narrative beats from action-econ “actions”, the latter being treated more as a currency than as ticks in a schedule.

A system with less solid fundamentals is one that is more arbitrary in how it goes about things. For example, something like <i>Runequest</i> has less solidity to its fundamentals in that there is no clear way to make combatants stronger or weaker, there's no default interface for circumstance modifiers, and scaling combatants or circumstance modifiers is non-existent.<br/><br/>What this means is that the core process in Runequest is less stable and more prone to unexpected outcomes (judgement calls that need to be revised due to unforeseen consequences, that is) than it would be in D&amp;D, requiring you to play things closer to the designed norm to keep the system operating as advertised. I'll provide a practical use case to demonstrate:<br/><br/><b>This GM wants to create a Neanderthal Warrior</b><br/><br/>The concept is that neanderthals are sort of like the orcs of the setting; they challenge the modern human to prove its mettle against a physically mightier alternative. Greater grip strength, stronger punches and so on.<br/><br/>The neanderthal warrior should be a formidable foe; a single individual would be a shoo-in for the Roman Colosseum, a star gladiator. Conan the barbarian would fight them and only triumph after a hard-fought battle. It has a clear advantage against a single ordinary human, but it is by no means undefeatable.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D the neanderthal warrior is a <i>very</i> quick design to create, mechanically speaking: 2 HD (or maybe 3) and... that's it, actually. The rest is largely procedurally emergent for a D&amp;D optimized for fluid, quick, etc. what the list of adjectives said. (You could instead do the miniatures skirmish combat modern D&amp;D thing and spend five hours crafting a stat block if you wanted, but that wasn't what we were doing, right?)<br/><br/>This D&amp;D version of the creature does exactly what we want it to do: it is a formidable foe, but not out of reach of a heroic individual. We could see an adventure party battle an entire troop of them. Everything that makes it "neanderthal-y" is in the fluff and emergent rulings: it's sort of slow-moving and might have a disadvantage in sensing stuff, for example, if that's what the GM understands the concept to be. Its AC comes down to whatever armour it wears, as the thick skin gets counter-balanced by being less nimble than a human would be. Maybe give it a point or two more damage on a successful hit than a human would get, if that's the mechanical flavour of the overall system.<br/><br/>How do you create this being in Runequest? Will your solution end up actually more powerful than a human warrior, like the D&amp;D version is thanks to its greater HD score? Presumably whatever you do is going to involve determining a Strength bonus and probably a Dexterity penalty. Take care fiddling those knobs, it's going to be easy to create something completely overpowering or completely underwhelming! There is no universal power scale in Runequest the way there is in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The flimsiness of Runequest's core structure becomes evident: it's fine as long as you're pitting player character types against each other, or using monsters out of a book. New monsters are more difficult, requiring careful stat block design to get the effect you want them to have. Essentially, you're playing with a system that does unexpected things when you postulate a fantastic combatant, forcing you to choose to either slow down (spend the time to create the considerate stat block carefully) or take a shot in the dark.<br/><br/>Of course the point here is not to rag on Runequest; it does its own thing. The point is to realize that D&amp;D is actually very solid in what it does, and that this solidity essentially translates into more freedom of imagination in what you can practically perform at the gaming table. The core structure of "more HP equals more combat strength" does not mind an improvised monster like the neanderthal warrior. D&amp;D, having clearer and more universal fundamentals, actively enables creative freedom without descending into chaos.                        </div>

                            The D&amp;D HD directly influences a number of other things aside from hit points. What exactly depends on the flavour, but usually at least the hit bonus and save scores. It's a sort of top-down approach to monster creation where you start with its metaphysical "stature" and develop down from that, rather than starting with how much it lifts and trying to figure out dangerous it is based on that. It's not quite as absolutist as Tunnels &amp; Trolls  - that literally only has a one-score monster stat block - but it's not far behind.<br/><br/>Also, saying that you can do the same thing in RQ as you do in D&amp;D is just saying that you can play a sort of clumsy D&amp;D with lots of superfluous stuff  with the RQ rules - it's not an endorsement of the RQ system, just an observation that if you ignore most of it you're left with something that sort of resembles D&amp;D.                        </div>

I have a hard time thinking of a faster <i>tactical</i> combat systems (I suspect T&amp;T might qualify). I do not count rules that resolve an entire battle with one set of rolls (i.e. conflict resolution) because that cuts out the ability to adjust one's tactics on the fly, reacting to battlefield developments by leveraging terrain, unleashing limited-use powers etc. (i.e. the mechanical and tactical richness Jeph desires).<br/><br/>A low-level ten vs. ten battle in early D&amp;D (and not 3e/4e, for instance) seems plenty fast to me (and exciting on account of the deadliness, though not in the sense of The Riddle of Steel with its guessing game, for instance). <br/><br/>Could you give examples of systems with some tactical depth that you think of as fast and exciting?<br/><br/>*-*-*<br/><br/>One thing I really like about simpler combat systems (early D&amp;D but also the aforementioned conflict resolution systems) is that they leave some mental capacity to actually imagine the scene, describe things with a flourish, or come up with interesting stunts or maneuvers etc. When you are adding up modifiers, counting squares, rolling multiple attacks etc. there is little time for that in my experience.                        </div>

                            Everyone, keep in mind that the OP is specifically referring to "modern D&amp;D" (and 5th Edition). That's a very particular kettle of fish!<br/><br/>(Old-school D&amp;D really shines when it comes to large groups battling it out, true. That's a big selling feature for me, too! But it's not really relevant to this thread, I think.)<br/><br/>However, even aside from that:<br/><br/>The comparison being made here is to "the Middle Earth game Silmenume plays", where people literally shout and jump up and down and you have to decide what you're doing within seconds or you're dead.<br/><br/>I hope you can see how, in that context, D&amp;D is at the far, far other end of the spectrum.<br/><br/>For instance, I would never design a game which is supposed to move fast (as the main design goal!) to have multiple rolls to resolve single actions (e.g. to hit + damage), arithmetic you need to write down (e.g. subtracting hit points, adding dice pools), and rules particulars you need to look up in a book (like spell effects).                        </div>

                            While I'm talking about modern D&amp;D, I'm used to running it in an OSR style.<br/><br/>The initiative system I <i>currently</i> use does away with turn order, resolving things in each "phase" of the round simultaneously.
<ol><li>So I shout out, "MAGIC" and someone yells "Fireball! 36 damage!" and I roll some saves and mark it off.</li>
<li>Then I yell "MISSILES!" and folks yell "Buncha nuthin'" and "Three hits for 7 from my mooks!" and "21 from my crossbow on the big guy!" and I say "Two of their frontliners go down and the big one's pretty wounded!"</li>
<li>Then I call "MOVEMENT! Two more come in to fill in the gaps in their front rank!" and someone says, "I'm falling back!" and someone else says "I come in to replace her!"</li>
<li>And then I yell "MELEE!" and roll a bunch of dice and say "Two hits to you from the little guys for 6 each! One hit to you from the big one for 12!" and they call out "Whiffs!" and "One hit fir 17!"</li></ol>
Each round takes like 2 minutes, for like half a dozen PCs + half a dozen hirelings vs a dozen monsters around 4th-6th level in 5e. It's so fast!<br/><br/>(EDIT: We have other tricks to make it go fast. We know the rules backwards and forwards. We roll entire attack routines for individuals and groups in parallel, not sequence, with different colored d20s lettings us distinguish attacks with different characteristics. We don't roll damage for monsters and hirelings. We usually omit stating targets, or even the fact that we're attacking; we just call out hits.)<br/><br/>I've also run a short campaign using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fkeUpKRQ-S-WS_xHZKae-kIXCoczgBSCyMtTyPHsC3M/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my take on the methods Silmenume's described</a>. Complete with no action economy at all, shouting up and down, and so forth.<br/><br/>I strive for some sort of happy marriage, perhaps impossible.                        </div>

                            But Paul - you were the one who claimed that D&amp;D is the wrong starting point for development if you want fast. That was the whole point - that Dungeons &amp; Dragons <i>in itself</i> is the wrong thing to start with. It just ain't so. Admittedly 5th edition is pretty far away from anything elegant, but it's still the same base chassis. It is not a fundamentally wrong choice in the way you implied.<br/><br/>Remember, I started from a 3rd edition chassis myself when I started paring down and building up towards my own happy house system. After what, 15 years at this point, it's nigh unrecognizable. I got rid of the action economy thing on the way, too, by the way, using a combination of the "action cost" and "false actions" conceits from my overview upthread. I don't think that it's impossible to end up somewhere similar starting with 5e.<br/><br/>Had you said that "Nothing about 5e combat is designed for speed and excitement" I wouldn't have batted an eye, but that wasn't the point: you were suggesting that the entire D&amp;D chassis should be discarded.<br/><br/>Note that this is all very relevant because hacking the action economy in modern D&amp;D is some pretty radical deep-trough diving into the messy guts of the game. We're not talking about cosmetic changes here any more. My own analysis of the matter basically stopped at the point where I'd have had to scrap the actual class design of the game to go any further, leaving little of the particularities of 5e.<br/><br/>In this context a perfectly viable answer to your claim that D&amp;D is not fast is that it actually is fast, even if 5e isn't. Presumably you'd want to look at those fast variants of the game to make 5e run faster, wouldn't you? Knowing that they exist is useful, and prima facie evidence that it's not outright impossible to achieve a happy solution. It's the opposite of what you implied, that the project would be doomed to failure at the start because <i>D&amp;D can't be agile</i>.                        </div>

                            I'd say, based on my 4e experiences, that getting rid of the action types thing would speed up the modern D&amp;D chassis immensely. The action typing may be a good thing for rigorous miniatures gaming, but the old way is better for being quick and intuitive, and not getting players stuck in analysis paralysis.<br/><br/>(The "old way" here is what D&amp;D used to do: on your turn you can do one action, moving if necessary, plus some stuff is so minor you can do it on the side. It's basically the same, except when you phrase it this way it doesn't devolve into abstract puzzle-fitting.)<br/><br/>The big, fat advantage of the old approach is basically that it encourages a SIS-based evaluation of the course of action: the question that the GM asks you on your turn is not "what combination of mechanical levers do you pull for maximum effect" so much as it is "given that you've been paying attention, what is the correct tack to take in this combat situation?" It's a single unified question. Aside from it being much more fiction-based (which isn't at trial here, although it is an advantage in my opinion), it is more unitary because you're asked for one <i>course of action</i> instead of a set of three actions.<br/><br/>The practical problem in importing this to modern D&amp;D, however, is that not only is your turn broken out into three actions (standard, move, minor) that you puzzle out separately, but also the actions themselves are typed. Some things that you might want to do are standard, others are minor, and you gotta care of the distinction, or you get the particular joy of rewriting the classes to account for the minor action type no longer existing.<br/><br/>An idle thought on a starting point that might lead somewhere on this: what if you could use your minor action, and possibly the move action as well, as immediate reactions? (We'd lift the cap on the number of those per round, of course.) Combine that with a culture of not waiting around for the player to finesse their turn, and you should technically speaking be back in the unitary action situation, more or less: the player's turn is one action, and they can mull over their move and minor while the others are playing, holding them in reserve or doing them when they figure out what to do or whatever.<br/><br/>Would something like that require major revision to the various ways 5e uses minor actions?<br/><br/>If not, then one could consider going a step further. Stealing from myself, I think that the modern D&amp;D combats would be much more exciting if players had reaction moves. If it were possible to use your minor at any point of the round, and there were one or two generically useful minor combat actions, wouldn't that be interesting? I'm thinking of something like "Focused defense", gets you +4 AC against a single attack, or "Riposte", lets you attack back if somebody misses you. Might help keep players engaged and paying attention throughout the round if they always had some reactive opportunity outside the vapid opportunity attack thing. (Vapid because it's a no-brainer and not something you choose - the enemy chooses to suffer it, you're just forced to take your eyes off your phone to roll the dice.) The fact that this would also ensure a certain baseline of effectiveness in action economy doesn't hurt; I've always found it a flaw in modern D&amp;D that players need to understand action economy to build optimal characters that actually expend their actions usefully, rather than wasting their minor every round because the player didn't realize to pay attention while picking their powers.                        </div>

All the mechanical gizmos, nothing's pared down. Hirelings don't typically have any sort of special abilities.<br/><br/>We still have people waffling about using special abilities! It just happens a lot faster. I think the difference is that everyone in the damn room is breathing down your neck to get on with it, when we use phases, which is a lot of social pressure. In standard initiative, it's just Betty waiting on you, everyone else is still scratching their butts whether or not its your turn or Betty's turn...<br/><br/>And whatever bits of waffling don't require verbal back-and-forth interaction happen in parallel, too!<br/><br/>Also, phases make it really, REALLY obvious when one person is a lot slower than everyone else at the table. It lets the group identify what they're having trouble with and help them remove that obstacle. Like, "Hey, you should be rolling all your attacks at the same time." Or, "You take the -5 attack for +10 damage whenever their AC is less than {whatever}, or if you think you can take 'em out without the bonus."<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, OH! Another thing that matters HUGELY. In phases, the state of the game changes at most 4 times per round. In turn-based initiative, the state of the game changes all. the. fucking. time, twice (move + attacks) for each combatant. This means that, in phase-land, you often know whether or not you want to use a special ability WAY ahead of time. I know whether Fireball is gonna hit a good number of enemies without roasting my friends as of the end of the previous Movement phase. By the time the Magic phase comes up, I just yell it out; I don't have to re-analyze where everyone's at.                        </div>

                            That's actually really interesting, Jeph; the phase initiative system is an oldie and goldie, but I've never realized that it has such pedagogical strength with a modern complex game. You usually see that initiative system in games that are handling-simple (as '80s games used to be, even when otherwise complex), so it's never occurred to me.<br/><br/>I can totally see how my own 4e game could be hell of a lot faster with something like that. The campaign's almost over, but now I regret not starting with a militant group initiative in the first place.                        </div>

                            I hadn't really considered that the more is spent waffling, the more is actually gained by having it happen in parallel.<br/><br/>And the insights about highlighting the stumbling blocks, and fewer state changes and therefore fewer reevaluations are great.<br/><br/>It might actually be more of a time saver over sequential turns in a more complex D&amp;D like 5E than in one where it's mostly move-whack anyway.                        </div>

                            Jeph, how are you adjudicating who hits whom? Like, those people who call out, "3 hits for 7 each," are you just, as GM assuming they're hitting the most wounded target they can reach? Do you ever use minis? On the "move" phase, do people get to do Opportunity Attacks if the moves would trigger them?<br/><br/>Also, I definitely love not rolling for damage in 5E, especially for monsters and NPCs. Even when they crit, you can just have them add an extra half-die of each damage die they normally do. This does require being good at arithmetic, which... yes. D&amp;D does require that, especially of the GM, but really of everyone.<br/><br/>It's also interesting to me that your broader point, Jeph, is that for D&amp;D combat to be fast and exciting, everyone needs to know the rules really well. Which is also a kind of "duh" thing, but I think it's actually quite rare. <br/><br/>The so-called veterans of 5E that Paul played with made routine and repeated basic errors in the rules. What happens with long-term groups when the GM has a very... loose... relationship with what's written in the books is that they will "play a system" for a long time, but what that actually means is that they develop extremely rigid procedures that are both unfun and flat-out against the printed rules. But no one in the group has the social capital to make changes to make the game more fun; if anyone does notice, their only choices are to put up with it or to leave the group. This is really, really common.                        </div>

If all the enemies have the same stats, yeah, I'll just assume they focus fire to the best of their ability. If there are two types of enemies, it usually becomes quickly evident that players will assume one is default, and not mention the target when they attack that one; and the other is specifically called out. When un-obvious, there might be an exchange like "3 hits for 7 each!" "The big guy?" "Yeah."<br/><br/>Are ya'll familiar with pro-drop languages? Finnish, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, all to some extent, will omit pronouns and even entire noun phrases when the entity the speaker wishes to refer to is obvious from context or the inflection of verbs &amp; adjectives. It works like that.<br/><br/>(I should do a primer on the applications of linguistic pragmatics to playin' games, some time.)<br/><br/>We don't use minis, but sometimes we'll push dice or beads into clumps to visually demonstrate some spatial relationship.<br/><br/>We play that opportunity attacks happen when one character moves away and an enemy in reach chooses not to follow. There are frequent little exchanges like, "He's falling back, follow or OA?" "Hit for 9!"<br/><br/>Or, "He's falling back." "I stay with him." "He'll dash to escape."<br/><br/>Or, "I drop back!" "He's gonna OA." "I'll Disengage."<br/><br/>As much as I love the phases we use, it's <i>very</i> different in feel from what I've got in my minds eye when I think about the system described in the OP.<br/><br/>EDIT: I don't mean to imply that we're all preternatural 5e rules-wizards, but most of us have been playing since we were 10 and we're 30 now, so. One guy is new-ish, but he went head first into the hobby and started DMing for another group like 10 sessions into the first campaign we played (and for the moment I'm taking a break while he DMs!). And another is less rock-solid on the rules, sometimes forget things, but those negotiations are quick. "Fuck, I shoulda used Hunter's Mark last turn." "No prob, we'll say you did it. Melee!"                        </div>

                            The conversation has moved on a fair bit... but I just wanted to say that, unfortunately, I'm not at all familiar with Runequest. How does it shoot itself in the foot in this sense? (Or use another example I might know better?)<br/><br/>Jeph,<br/><br/>Your group sounds incredible. I find it hard to even imagine that level of familiarity and fluency.<br/><br/>For a comparison we can all easily look at, the <i>Critical Role</i> folks play weekly in front of a huge audience, certainly are familiar with the rules, have a rock-solid and astute GM and the same characters week to week, and even people helping look up rules alongside to help move things along. Their average combat takes <i>just under an hour</i> (someone actually made a log of every combat in their campaign in a spreadsheet!), meaning that many, many fights take far more time.<br/><br/>I find it hard to imagine getting a group to be that committed to D&amp;D (the same game, weekly, for years on end?), never mind beating that.                        </div>

                            Meanwhile, here's a simple design idea:<br/><br/>* Hit points are a pacing mechanism. They tell us when the fight ends.<br/><br/>* We want to get rid of the action economy but to maintain the effects of actions.<br/><br/>* Give each player a pile of tokens (equal to their HP).<br/><br/>* Whenever you act, you give away/lose/spend some number of tokens.<br/><br/>That sort of thing could work fairly seamlessly without any kind of order or action economy, since you have a built-in pressure not to act too much or too often.                        </div>

This started at WRNU (another forum); where people were like “Sandra, if you’re gonna post so much, you need to start linking to everything you reference!”. (Which, uh, gift horse much? But sure.) So I set up a “chewing gum &amp; hanger wire” mashup of elisp, pandoc, zsh, zenity and sqlite to help me search through my firefox browser history (which it stores in sqlite) and add links.

<p>Speaking of social capital…</p><p>it’s weird, one of the reason I had to rely so much on rules is that I started out with like zero authority as a DM. People would run roughshod over me when I tried to speak (#patriarchy…? I mean, maybe?). Creating rules was the one thing I found that worked. It’s hard to create a rule that kind of enforces itself but one way to do that is to make rules that answer questions. Like, people would be like “OK, who can I hit from here?” and I’d be like “You can hit that goblin” and Bob’d be like “Well, that’s just your opinion, Sandra, how about you, Ted, don’t you think I could hit the stirge from here?” and Ted would be like “Yeah, for sure!” and Bob’d go “OK, then I kill the stirge”. Whereas if I can quote page&amp;paragraph it’s no longer “just my opinion”.</p><p>But now after DMing for years and gradually building up social capital through my rules mastery I’ve also found that I’ve learned how to become more assertive in other contexts even with people I’ve never played D&amp;D with. It’s been pretty interesting. I also run a shikantaza group Wednesdays and I’ve slowly grown from being a weirdo mousy girl that’s that shyly says <small>“ok it’s time to start now… if you wish… please…”<small> to like loudly &amp; cleary be like “OK! Welcome, everyone!” etc.</small></small></p><p><small>(Hmm although.. the increased social capital kind of coincided with getting inked! Maybe it’s tats more than rules mastery! Otoh the third and probably biggest factor was going through 2 years of pretty intensive therapy where we did tons of exercises on being assertive in relationships. <small>Offhand throwaway truth bomb</small>)</small></p><p>But seriously I do think the rules mastery was a giant part of it. Between our first and second session ever (this was in <abbr title="Lost Mines of Phandelver">LMoP</abbr>) I learned about the Petitioner/Granter stuff. I had had a weak af NPC interaction “this town, uh, hmm, looks for heroes! that’s right!” which was weird because when I was doing improv I could always do NPCs just fine; but post mirror story I had a harder time. So I decided to look for books on it and found Unframed &amp; Law’s chapter in it and wow, that was dynamite, made dialogues so much crisper! Because it turns out there are rules for talking♥ BTW I also use the petitioner/granter skills at church! Come to my congregation &amp; get emotionally validated♥</p><p>Another clear example of where rules mastery was <em>crucial</em> was <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22062/scheduling-game-days-in-the-grim-dark-future-of-the-year-2097-where-there-is-only-d-d/p1" rel="nofollow">date selection</a>; this was post therapy, post tats, post everything but they would still just be complete fucks about scheduling until I codified the rough heuristics I had bricolaged rattling round in my head into an explicit algorithm and put it in <code>git</code>. That was a godsend♥ I mean I had to do all the work but still. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23lawfulevil2097&amp;Mode=like">#lawfulevil2097</a></p> </div>

We're not wizards! We just know the rules pretty well, <i>just</i> enough that we only rarely have to look stuff up in play, and when we do we usually can find the reference very quickly. And we have a few good habits around rules lookups:<br/><br/>People start looking stuff up when they have a jonesin' to use an ability they don't remember 100%, not at the point of application, not "Rebuke! Fuck how does Rebuke work again?" Maybe because you don't have a sacrosanct Turn, where you get to dominate table time and force everyone else to wait until you're done making decisions and doing things?<br/><br/>And we're good about punting. If we try to look something up and it's not in the first place we check, I'll say, "This time, it'll go {whatever arbitrary way}, and we'll look it up later."<br/><br/>Last, we don't use any supplements. Core + a campaign google doc only.<br/><br/>We're not godly rules-savants, we're just numerate, experienced, courteous, and hygienic.

Haha, yes. Or actually no!<br/><br/>I've already vacillated between the extremes. The phased rounds we've been chatting about, and my attempt at recreating Silmenume's and Cary's play style. Those are the extremes!<br/><br/>This thread is about an attempt at a gentle and moderate median between the two.<br/><br/>Your comment around dilated handling time for this sort of IIEE structure fills me with fear, because I bet you're right but don't want to admit it.                        </div>

                            Holy crap, that's a lot longer!<br/><br/>From the other threads, it sounds like everything else about the fights you ran was excellent.<br/><br/>But, like, that's a <i>lot</i> longer!<br/><br/>You and I share a lot of goals at the table, but also run D&amp;D very differently; for instance like you've pointed out I tend to say "here's a rules framework, interact with that please," while you tend to say, "act only diageticaly, here's the rules framework I'll use to interpret your actions but you don't need to pay attention to it during play."<br/><br/>With that in mind. I'm reading your <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483404/#Comment_483404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play</a> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/483400/#Comment_483400" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">descriptions</a> and thinking, "This is awesome but it would never work at my table!" Why? Maybe:
<ul><li>I can't identify points where all the additional diagetic steps ("I roll laterally, to the side!" "OK, you can spend 9 HP to do that") feed back into the dice. The player could have said, "Kerfuffle, xylophone!" and you would have responded, "OK, you can spend 9 HP to do that."</li>
<li>The increased handling time! That's hella big! I'd be worrying, hey, this is eating into the amount of stuff that happens in the session, the number of meaningful choices per human per hour. It's reducing the total entropy of the product of all the choices made over the course of the entire campaign!</li></ul> </div>

                            I once designed a "skirmish" system for 5E where players just spent resources to defeat a certain number of Hit Dice of monsters. It was to allow one-round resolution of combat for minor fights. This was actually designed for play-by-post! But I still think it's a decent idea overall, since 5E breaks so hard if you only have 1-2 combats before allowing a long rest.<br/><br/>I seem to have lost it, but I think it went something like this (the numbers may not be right, but the ideas are basically correct*):<br/><br/>Every HD of monster in a fight costs the party 5 HP. The party can simply pay the cost, apportioning the damage as desired, BUT expendable party resources can also help defray the cost of the encounter. A rough schema might be something like:<br/><br/>5 HP per level of spell expended<br/>5 HP per character level for expending a Barbarian rage (which is <i>really good</i>, y'all)<br/>2 HP for spending a Bardic Inspiration d6 die, increased by 1 every time the die size goes up<br/>3 HP per character level for using an appropriate Channel Divinity<br/><br/>Etc. Wouldn't cover everything, but could be nice.<br/><br/>You could even do stuff like have the cost be decreased by 20% if the PCs set up an ambush with appropriate skill rolls, or decreased by some other factor if the PCs, e.g., know the monsters' elemental weaknesses.<br/><br/>*Originally I had this weird blind bidding thing, but in hindsight I think it'd be better to just let them work it out at the table level.                        </div>

You could make it so that only successful attacks (from either party) are even "sent", non-successful attacks are just quickly ignored &amp; action tallied. The ones that are "sent" leads into the full "attack described, defense described, ok that costs X hp" for hobos and "attack described, hp-spent-to-defend, which is described" for monsters.<br/><br/>That'd cut down some. It becomes weird because what does your AC represent? Uh.<br/><br/>But we did have one guy combining all of his multiattacks into one narrative strike and that was awesome!                        </div>

                            Regarding the skirmish rules, if I may - a few comments. As you may know, I use methods similar to Deliverator's postal play skirmish rules in my wargamey D&amp;D to speed up play and deal with trivial encounters.<br/><br/>Were I doing this, I would try to retain the fundamental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws" rel="nofollow">Lanchester's Laws</a> arrangement underlying the D&amp;D combat model - it seems a shame to let go of that when it's basically the fundamental merit of D&amp;D's combat model as inherited from wargaming. Whatever else one may say about D&amp;D combat, <i>at least</i> it holds true that a group with double the firepower deals double the damage on the opposing side over a given time-frame (which is of course the combat round).<br/><br/>To achieve this, though, we can't let players buy themselves out of an encounter with a static 5 HP per HD ratio; rather, you should calculate a force correlation factor based on the relative strengths of the sides, and use that to determine the price.<br/><br/>In old school D&amp;D you could generally sum up the HD on each side of the fight and use that as the force correlation: the game generally tends to be designed in such a way that a 5th level character is roughly as effective as five 1st level characters. (Specifically: the combat longevity, minor attack effectiveness bonuses and various hax that the higher-level character gains are supposed to roughly off-set the higher number of attacks and circumstance advantages that the larger group would have.) Whether this holds true for a given edition of the game depends on particulars, and I think it's pretty obvious that it doesn't apply to modern D&amp;D for the most part, but it might still be a preferable simplification. Or maybe you should use the square of the average party HD multiplied by number of members, might be closer.<br/><br/>But anyway, we produce some numbers that can be compared to each other, and then use that ratio to correct the pricing on what the adventuring party should pay to brush away a minor encounter. This could be as simple as multiplying the base cost by the force ratio: 4 goblins with 1 HD each would cost 20 HP for an equal-sized force, but if the adventuring party has 8 HD, they'll only pay 10 HP because they overpower the opposition by a 2:1 ratio. The stronger you are, the less you pay.<br/><br/>Alternatively - and this is often enough exactly what I do - you could just run the game's own core process for a few cycles and let it grind out an outcome. This is what I often do for "large skirmishes" - those combats that have too many participants to be run comfortably with the normal swashbuckling combat rules with initiative and individual maneuvers and stuff, but that are too small to use proper mass combat procedures. 20-100 participants, for instance. No reason why you couldn't use the same principles with smaller skirmishes, too.<br/><br/>In fact, I'll just lay out my "large skirmish" rules for old D&amp;D here - might include something useful, and I think that it helps illustrate what I mean by "grinding the core process". I think it's quite beautiful how D&amp;D manages the Lanchester's Laws, myself. It's essentially still a wargame when abstracted out to this level.<br/><br/><b>How to resolve large skirmishes in old D&amp;D</b><br/><br/>At the start of the combat round talk about the fictional positioning however much you need to. Figure out which parts of the forces engage which other parts - there could be some bow-men, swordsmen or whatever involved. If you just want a result, then assume that all forces on both sides engage effectively, tactics be damned.<br/><br/>For each combat-participant who manages to engage this round roll a d6. The default hit probability is 50%, so 4-6 hits and 1-3 misses. For forces that have an effectiveness disadvantage (skill, equipment, whatever) only 5-6 hits, and contrariwise for superior forces 3-6 hits. You might have PCs roll their actual d20 to-hit rolls, as players seem to enjoy that, but presumably the scale of the combat is so large that their individual performance only has a minor impact. Similarly, if the forces are too large to roll all the dice, scale the dice proportionally: e.g. roll 10d6 and have each die count for 10 combatants in a 100-man company.<br/><br/>(You might notice that this is very roughly the same odds as basic D&amp;D has for individual combat: armor class and hit bonuses come down to this same range for approximately real human combatants.)<br/><br/>Because 50% casualties per round is a tad too quick of a round for tactical purposes, and because D&amp;D <i>does</i> have the concept, you will probably want to do a "damage soak" stage next: for each hit of damage caused, roll the die again and discard the hit on a 1-3; this signifies a hit that was too minor to down a combatant. The remaining hits are all severe enough to put down a foe (assuming they're 1 HD, as all normal combatants are). You probably don't want to track actual HP for 50 separate combatants, but what I do is that I jot down the number of "soaked hits" and factor that into the next round of combat, if such is upcoming.<br/><br/>After deducing casualties you're ready for another round! Do some more maneuvering to shift forces around and represent the tactical consequences of the round you just resolved, then continue on to dicing the second round. Don't forget morale checks where applicable. Assuming completely non-descript battle space, force quality and tactics, the combatants each cause 25% of their own strength in attrition to the opponent every round, with a binomial random distribution providing some excitement to the process. It's quick to do at the table, too, assuming you have enough dice.                        </div>

                            The big virtue that I hope to illustrate by discussing this simplified form of D&amp;D combat relates to the idea of proportionality: by rolling even simplified attack rolls for every combatant, the system automatically accounts for force parity. The force with double the number of combatants gets, on average, double the number of hits. And because more hits whittles down the enemy force quicker, the enemy has even less attack strength on its next round. The system very neatly, very succinctly respects Lanchester's square law without asking for the complex math that you'd require to do the same calculation without iteration. (The dicing process round by round is mathematically rather similar to running an iterative serial calculus on an abacus, except it also includes a stochastic variable.)<br/><br/>We might utilize that same idea for "quick combat" in modern D&amp;D context by saying that each combatant by default eliminates enemy HD equal to the square root of their own level each round. So a 1st level character deals 1 HD damage, and a 4th level character deals 2 HD. We could dice it out, too, but doing a static calculation might fit the modern spirit better - we want resource attrition, not an accidental TPK. Presumably any combat that would actually cause meaningful attrition by the quick combat formula should actually be played out blow by blow.<br/><br/>On top of the default force-elimination potential PCs would then use their combat talents to speed up the process and therefore reduce the attrition to their own side. To simplify the issue I would just say that linear classes (fighters etc. with their powers always on) get to double their nominal HD for the damage calculation, while quadratic classes (wizards etc. with daily powers) may expend one daily power per round (random pick?) to do double damage for that round. Half-ass classes (which 5e does have, I understand) need to be dealt with somehow, too. Monsters and NPCs and other disinteresting critters just get the baseline unless the GM feels otherwise.<br/><br/>The damage in this scheme would be distributed one half evenly (randomly) between the opponents, and another half evenly between the opponent "front line", however you want to define that. Individual combatants go down when they take damage equal to their HD, and thus do not contribute to the next round of quick combat. At the end of the combat you'd presumably convert the HD of damage into concrete HP damage for the player characters.<br/><br/>Something like that, maybe. The disadvantage of this approach would be that you'd need to calculate multiple rounds of "quick combat" to figure out the final result. The advantage would be that it'd account for on-going force attrition during the combat, which would make the numbers of combatants count more for the final outcome: a superior force could indeed brush away a minor threat with minimal damage, but the amount of damage you take yourself would quickly go up against anything resembling an equal foe.<br/><br/>Food for thought, anyway.                        </div>

Aha! I see. Hmmmm. Hmm hm.<br/><br/>Does what the player says here here flow into anything outside of determining whether the hobo spends HP to avoid the attack, or eats it and rolls on the injury table?<br/><br/>As in, is it a single rules decision (dive or spend HP?) + mandatory color narration to help everyone visualize the fight? Or are you establishing fictional positioning that at some point feeds back into the dice?<br/><br/>One thing I can see this back-and-forth establishing is who acts next. "I parry and block, falling back to Bob's position!" "Bob, Alice stumbles past you, a ghoul hot on her heals, what do you do?"<br/><br/>DeReel / Deliverator / Eero, I think I'll spin the skirmish discussion off into another thread if ya'll don't mind.

<p>The old system created a situation where we make decisions on the dice level (character sheet, points, dice, abilities etc), execute them on the dice level, record their results on the dice level, and then go on to make new decisions on the dice level.</p><p>Then we were simultaneously tasked with describing the “shadow” cast onto the diegesis by all of those dice-level events, post-hoc. I don’t know about you, but I’ve found performing that translation incredibly difficult, creatively, and most of the time, especially after those first three weeks or so back in 2014, I just gave up and only did the numbers and we had some sort of post-combat: “ok ok here is the XP anyone wanna short rest?”.</p><p>By contrast, the new system is this eternal golden braid with specific points where the diegesis hands over to dice and the dice hands back to the diegesis. It feels like it lives in the diegesis and then the answers that the dice gives us, whenever they’re consulted, just make sense and are cool.</p><p>The description isn’t color narration, it’s necessary because it feeds into other diegetical actions. It was immediately obvious when a descriptive beat was missed because it was such a “uh, wait, we can’t even resolve this action because we don’t know how to do that without you saying exactly how you defended against that bite attack”.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Or are you establishing fictional positioning that at some point feeds back into the dice?</p></div></blockquote><p>To be completely honest, it’s true that very few of our “dice” mechanics take meaningful input from the diegesis. Our most recent mechanic, the “wounding monsters”, does. (A mechanic which owes more to Fate, than to Forged in the Dark or Powered by the Apocalypse.)</p><p>Remember, we started with a <em>very</em> complete system, a <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/introducing-late-night-fighting/" rel="nofollow">system that answered questions</a> that some systems don’t even know are being asked, such as “who does the monster attack?” and “who can I hit with this fireball”? etc. (Some, not all!)</p><p>It’s not like Everway were it’s like “hmm, this card would usually mean death for the hero but since the hero dressed as a Scorpio last Tuesday…”</p><p>But we’re just getting started. D&amp;D does have the adv &amp; disadv parameters to play with. I already proposed a new mechanic, that you can get insp if your traits, ideals, bonds and flaws prevent you from defending yourself. Not sure that’ll see a ton of use but it’s just an idea.</p><p>I mean to what extent does Dungeon World really “feed back into the dice”? Diving to the left way of the arrow or diving under it or raising your shield—it’s all “defy danger”. DW has all the same DC (7/10) all the time and it’s pretty much just the stat choice, dex vs str or w/e.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Does what the player says here here flow into anything outside of determining whether the hobo spends HP to avoid the attack, or eats it and rolls on the injury table?</p></div></blockquote><p>While it might not flow into <em>dice</em> level inputs particularly often (yet! or, ever, not sure it’s that desirable to lose the extreme objectivity of our current system), it sure as heckfire flows into other <em>diegetical</em> inputs.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>One thing I can see this back-and-forth establishing is who acts next. “I parry and block, falling back to Bob’s position!” “Bob, Alice stumbles past you, a ghoul hot on her heals, what do you do?”</p></div></blockquote><p>Yes this definitely happened!</p><p>Yes, that’s a dice-level input but seldomly a meaningful one, since the only time that kinda order matters is for drawing aggro or applying buffs. <small>There was actually a record scratch moment where the cleric got salty af [if you read this, Carol, talk to me when you have time] because she wanted to buff Ted’s sword. I had just turned to Ted, describing how the gargoy.. “No.” “Whaddayamean no, Carol?” “I wanted to do something.” (That sucked)</small></p><p>At one point the gargoyle tried to grapple Alice [I mix these names up all the time, to protect <del>the innocent</del> those who already serving their hard time under my harsh rule. Sometimes Alice is our cleric, sometimes our wizard etc] and that was also something that just sort of, uh, flowed from the SIS.</p><p>And that was it in terms of diegetics actually <em>changing</em> dice. Again, we already have an incredibly robust dice system with conditions such as prone, grappled etc and our monster-target-selection algorithm that uses (among other things) those conditions to decide how they act.</p><p>But the narration flowed <em>into other narration</em> soooo much! Standing on the ledge stepping on the garg head, somersaults into each other, Ted luring one garg to swipe at him while Bob blasted it with Fear…</p><p>Like, all of the richness of our dice-level mechanics aren’t obstacles at all, it’s nice AF that we have the grapple rules memorized or opportunity attacks or w/e.</p><p>That said….</p><p>♫pom pom pom♫</p><p>… one of the reasons why the diegetics is sooo dependent on what diegesis preceded it, is that fundamental vagueness of the core mechanic.</p><p>A defense roll can mean</p><ul><li>Deflecting with your shield</li><li>Parrying with your weapon</li><li>Positioning your armor</li><li>Shifting out of the way</li><li>If you have mage armor on: maybe doves come out and eat the bullets like in a John Woo film</li></ul><p><small>(Sidebar: Yes it’s weird AF that when defending vs spells there are seven different mods to choose from depending on the spell [the six save categories + defense rolls] while defending againts normal attacks can be done in a thousand ways but still use the same roll. Not saying I would want more detail, the other way around: a simple save vs spells would be pretty awesome instead of the six categories.)</small></p><p>And then if that defense roll fails the monster attacks the second line of defense; so I need to know what that first line of defense was.</p><p>For example “I use shield!” <em>[defense roll]</em> “OK you block three of the hydra heads, the fourth head slips past your shield, what do you do?” “I push it aside with my morning star!” <em>[hp spend]</em> or</p><p>For example “I push the heads aside with my morning star!” <em>[defense roll]</em> “OK you push three of the hydra heads aside, the fourth head slips under your morningstar, what do you do?” “I use shield!” <em>[hp spend]</em></p><p>That’s why the diegesis is essential, it’s not painted on description, it’s needed to set up the next move.</p><p>Is there a meaningful difference between those two situations on the <em>dice</em> level? No. They’re the exact same. But if the player just says “I defend!” I go “Sure! Go ahea… wait, <strong>how</strong> do you defend?” Because I <em>need</em> to know in order to continue playing the hydra. And isn’t that, after all, the goal of the IIEE designer since she first looked up on the starry night sky?</p><p>So as far as I’m concerned, the answer to the “kerfuffle xylophone” question is definitely answered to my own satisfaction.</p><p>And maybe future refinement of this game can lead into the diegesis causing meaningful difference on the dice level, or maybe it’s better to keep it all “purely objective”. Because the risk of the dice having diegetical inputs is that you get the way I first thought Blades in the Dark was, “Wait, it seems super fuzzy and BSy whether a sitch is risky or desperate?” [Sorry that was just my first impression I’m sure the game is great.]</p><p>(PS big ups to Paul who did a lot of the work on this system.)</p> </div>

Ah, see, I think this is actually really different!<br/><br/>When a player in DW does something that triggers Defy Danger, what that something is—the fictional positioning—has huge impact, because the GM has to make a move that follows.<br/><br/>That means that the player's utterance directly constrains the move the GM makes. And it also directly constrains what subsequent actions the player is in position to take. And depending on what the player says, it might not even count as Defy Danger.<br/><br/>"Alice, the dragon turns towards you and spreads its jaws. Its gonna breathe fire! What do you do?"
<h2>(A)</h2>
<ul><li>Alice: "I raise my shield to deflect the flames and charge forward!"</li>
<li>GM: "Defy danger +Str!" (Alice's player rolls an 8) "The heat is overwhelming. Do you stumble back, dazed, or power through while your shield melts around your arm?"</li>
<li>Alice: "I power through, toss aside the scraps of my shield, and drive my sword into its belly!"</li>
<li>GM: "Roll hack and slash!"</li></ul>
<h2>(B)</h2>
<ul><li>Alice: "I interpose myself between the dragon and Bob and raise my shield to deflect the flames!"</li>
<li>GM: "You're standing in defense, roll +Con!" (Alice's player rolls an 8) "Hold 1, how do you use it?"</li>
<li>Alice: "I'll take the heat and give Bob +1 forward!"</li>
<li>GM: "Take 7 damage from the flames. Bob, you have an opening, what do you do?"</li></ul>

                            The example you adapted from Jay was helpful!<br/><br/>Dice→diegesis constraints are strong in that I'm usually trying to achieve a specific dice effect (roll an attack, roll defense, spend HP), and to do that, I need to say something very specific.

                            What ended up happening is that the diegetical moves then often led into or reminded us of dice-level options that we might've otherwise overlooked.

I believe that the situation was as you describe: different mindset for different participants. It is certainly the case that many people play DW and AW thinking about their moves and therefore saying things with the explicit intent of leading into one of those moves. Which is allowed &amp; encouraged by <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> and by Cary for that matter (the "perception" and "insight" moves that they use). "Oh, Injury!" is absolutely similar in that regard.<br/><br/>If that's not what I wanted, I would whip out my Everway set instead of creating the rules that I have here. Which, well, super nostalgic for it &amp; <i>great</i> setting, so maybe that wouldn't be too bad... many of the problems I had with Everway back in the day could be addressed by making better (more Karma-supporting) prep, and relying heavily on the Finchian trap-finding and Lawsian emo-petitioning that I already do today.                        </div>

                            I think the difference between the DW action flow and the 2097e action flow is pretty simple:<br/><br/>When the DW GM says that there is a sword or dragon breath incoming, and asks, “what do you do?”, it’s a genuine open-ended question. <br/><br/>There are a variety of moves you can make, non-move actions, and so forth - perhaps you could try to cast a spell as you are engulfed in the flames, for instance. If you do defy danger, the description changes which stat you will roll, too (minor as that is). It’s genuinely your turn to act, though, in any case.<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D version - and I think this is what Jeph was getting at - you have a binary choice: roll to defend or go down. It’s not open-ended. And since you will very very rarely choose to “take the blow”, it’s ALMOST a forced choice. <br/><br/>Then that happens again with the HP spend; same choice.<br/><br/>It does seem like an improvement in some respects on normal D&amp;D flow, but it’s very limited and there are several steps in the process which include very few choices. (You can see that from how the player simply repeats “I roll away/to the side” in the example Sandra wrote up earlier. This is why my original proposal, as clunky as it was in some ways, tried to add some real choice into that step (do you parry or fall back? Do you spend extra HP to get out of the way of the attack completely?). Since we don’t know what the next step will be, we have to actually listen to the player’s choice and narration. In this, we could have a player say, “I spend 10 HP to avoid, baking a soufflé,” and it still works with the action flow.                        </div>

Ah, but it's <i>also</i> essentially how <i>Chainmail</i> runs. I'm no wargaming expert, but this kind of dice pool approach seems to have become common in the scene sometimes in the '70s. It's got a lot of advantages compared to table-based approaches, after all.                        </div>

Yeah, it's probably a virtue when the structure of play works seamlessly when players don't have identical attitudes, way less brittle.<br/><br/>What is it, exactly, that I want, anyway?

Not really; that's like saying "I hack and slash, baking a soufflé!". It's not a valid contribution; in the cold dark future of the year 2097 just as in DW to do it, do it, I believe.<br/><br/>(This is just a rehash of the earlier kerfuffle xylophone example.)<br/><br/>But I get your point that the number of valid dice-level choices is pretty limited, and depending on which of those choices you want, the space of valid fictional contributions is also relatively small.                        </div>

                            I don’t follow why that would be the case. In DW, the player is making an open-ended choice - it’s their “turn”, and a theoretically unlimited number of actions is available to them.<br/><br/>Under these rules, “take the hit” or “spend HP” are your only two options”, so once you declare that you’re spending HP, the subsequent narration is almost entirely superfluous. <br/><br/>It sounds like the group is finding good ways to use that narration to flow into subsequent actions (by, for instance, leading Sandra to decide whose turn is next), but that’s a nice flourish, as opposed to being necessary in any way.<br/><br/>(It’s worth remembering that that kind of flexibility can be a virtue, as well; like Sandra says, she can return to “dice only” mode to resolve a combat quickly, for example - but let’s not pretend something is doing something it’s not.)                        </div>

                            Yeah, excellent. Sounds like we're basically in agreement (although I still disagree about the example - I could explain why if you want) - so long as discipline is remembered and enforced, it should continue to work well (and, yeah, sorry, I jumped to "the killing prompt" rather abruptly there!).<br/><br/>I really like the way all the 2097e rules are coming together to create a new game. I think that at this point, many other people would be publishing their own RPG, rather than calling it D&amp;D, but I don't think you're interested in that (I could be wrong!).<br/><br/>(I should perhaps clarify that what I mean is that you have enough inspired, original, and unique material here to distinguish "your game" from anything else on the market, which is pretty cool.)

(Have I mentioned how much I love your "dungeons for ants" line?  Makes me laugh every time.)<br/><br/>Anyway: very curious as to what you accidentally omitted up there in the quote!<br/><br/>And thank you for breaking down the challenges and advantages of using your combat sheet. I agree that some practice would be necessary, but the algorithm is limited enough that you'd probably become fluent with it fairly quickly. I like it!<br/><br/>What about tracking the diegetics vs. action economy? Who goes when, and that kind of thing? How do you make that smooth and easy? Or is that still a work in progress? I'd be worried about tracking all that in the heat of battle, and the action economy is so key to D&amp;D.                        </div>

1. I had a feeling it was going to feel awkward. Why do people dislike this one, and why does it fall flat in play? After all, in <i>Critical Role</i> seem to enjoy the "HDYWTDT?" prompt (even though Mercer usually narrates it himself in the end, anyway). What do you think the difference is?<br/><br/>Here, a(nother) reframing of the "mapping" between mechanics and dialogue could actually fix it, I think.<br/><br/>2. I still find this hard to imagine/understand. Can you give an example of what that breakdown looks like, in practice?<br/><br/>After all, you're quite capable of doing "Dungeons &amp; Yahtzee" (or whatever hilarious term you had used!), so why doesn't that work here?<br/><br/>3. That's a really good technique and mindset, but not unique to you, I think. Lots of people play in that way, whether they consciously think that way or not.<br/><br/>But all these other details you've put together are starting to form a really unique game and game experience, to the point that it's as (or more) distinct from D&amp;D than many other games out there.<br/><br/>4. Absolutely! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <br/><br/>(That's part of what makes it so good!)                        </div>

Note that DW has zero of this because it’s always 2d6+stat vs 7/10. Blades in the Dark has a lot more of it where position/effect are two “inputs” to the dice engagement.</li><li>gave myself a pretty darn <strong>good</strong> excuse: this system worked perfectly in dice-only mode for 5 years so ofc the “dice engagements” are set up to not rely on diegetics. I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20652/spatial-relationships-in-verbal-games/p1" rel="nofollow">had previously <strong>deliberately decoupled</strong> the dice engagements from being too dependent on diegetic specifics</a>, including things that almost <em>every other DM on Earth</em> rely on the diegetics to determine, such as “who are hit by the fireball” or “who does the monster attack” and that’s not undone in a day.</li><li>explained that the even though they <small>[during first session, before the adv/disadv change for second session]</small> didn’t affect the <em>inputs</em> to the dice, we found that they affected the <strong>choice</strong> of dice engagement very often. (In programming terms: dispatching which function was being called.) For example increased use of grapple, disarm, shove from both hobos and monsters, and a whole new set of lesser-used spells and moves from the hobos, including rank switching a lot more. Similar to Jeph’s example from DW where Alice chooses between defending herself or defending Bob based on the diegetics.</li><li>(and this is one I’m getting the most frustrated with you denying, and this is the one where we’re repeating ourselves / talking past each other to an embarrassing degree): Just as how in DW, there are several diegetic circumstances that are all resolved with Defy Danger, here there are several diegetic moves that are all resolved with a defense roll or a hit point spend. The <strong>choice of diegetic move still matters</strong> because it affects the diegetic response. Now, to the counter argument that “well it’s all the same on the dice level in the end”, see points 1 through 3 above. As I said, ironically, the killing blow is the only skippable diegetic move [I just need discipline for it]; if the monster can defend, I need to say how it does that so I can explain to the player why their diegetic position was compromised; and in order to defend I need to know from the player the diegetic <em>specifics</em> of the attack etc.</li></ol><p>Straw doll version of Paul “Now, what does that matter, in the end the monster lives or dies depending on dice alone”; well, that’s if it’s just one hobo &amp; one monster. But there’s often multiple on both sides and what happened was that trap-finding and monster-fighting were a lot more integrated seamlessly. Even though one monster dies, maybe others are still alive and your fictional positioning still matters when fighting with them [for reasons 1,2,3 <strong>and 4</strong>] or dealing with traps or social fallout from defending/abandoning each other.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For the killing blow, have you tried, “it can’t dodge this one… what happens?”</p></div></blockquote><p>Yes, tried it (I do pretty diligent testing of variant phrases &amp; discoursive sequences), ran into stance issue right away.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, on the issue of maneuvering vs attacking, I’ll start a new thread.

(So you’re trying to tear down your own idea ♥.) The stare-stare-stare-chop <em>Yojimbo</em> think can’t work, but the clang-clang-clang-touché most certainly can, albeit with a little bit more weight behind the clangs than I’d like. Swashbuckling yes, chambara no. One out of two ain’t that bad. <strong>If</strong> someone maneuvers, and they happen to kill the foe, then I’ll open a killing prompt just for that special (maybe never) case.</p> </div>

                            Oh, no! I'm not trying to tear anything down. Clearly it's working for you - and I've repeatedly said that I want to try it myself.<br/><br/>What you're saying about stance issues makes instant sense to me, for instance.<br/><br/>I'm just having trouble visualizing your particular arguments(?)/statements(?) here. For instance, what I take from your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is that having a more vivid, descriptive fiction is reminding people to use other combat options more often. Is that right? That's a useful thing, no doubt. I've always tried to make D&amp;D combat feel more dynamic than "people standing still, whacking at each other", and describing the ebb and flow of battle is a huge part of that. Agreed.<br/><br/>That covers <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, as well, right? I'm not disagreeing with any of this - not sure why I'm coming across as being adversarial here. That's not my intention.<br/><br/>(#3, though, is the thing I'm most curious about, and I've never seen you actually explain what that looks like. That's what I was hoping for an example of. But I think, if I got it in the long paragraph above, then it makes sense to me.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is the one I simply don't understand. In both DW and 2097e, the dice (in the literal sense) aren't directly affected by the narration: we still roll the same dice and add the same numbers. However, in DW, we don't know what rule or move is getting engaged until we hear the player's decision/description/narration. Is it Hack and Slash? Defy Danger? Defend? Just trade harm for harm? It seems to me that in 2097e, it's either "I suffer the attack", or "I roll defense", and, on a failed defense, it's always "I spend HP" - no way around that. But perhaps adding the option of "I suffer the attack" at each of those points has dramatically changed the flow of battle? (I find that hard to imagine, because I can't see players doing that very often <i>unless the action economy also changes, such that forfeiting defense would grant an extra chance to do something</i>, but perhaps that's what's happening.)<br/><br/>Does that help clarify, or just make it more confusing for you? I'm willing to drop this, too; it's not really a super important point. I'm just curious, because your statements about increased diegetic meaningfulness in combat description doesn't seem to flow naturally from the rules being used. I'd ask you to be patient with me, since you made the same assumptions until you actually tried it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm basically in your shoes a week ago (or whenever that actually was).                        </div>

That’s an option DW doesn’t even give you. The other niche case is when you don’t know how to narrate your way out of the pinch you’re in. However, I’m not primarily arguing from either of those two niche cases; the situation proposed was one where the player <em>did</em> want to avoid harm.

That’s a perfect fit with the “Players make all rolls” UA that we’ve used for many years; since that UA means that the monsters can’t use dice engagement to attack, they have to make diegetical moves. I hope this is the missing puzzle piece <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> ♥</p> </div>
