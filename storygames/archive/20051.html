Now, all i have to do is to make up a setting <br/><br/>in which this moves are fictionally supported. For one thing, all main characters in this world are psykers, plot armor is best armor, fix <br/><br/>technology with brute force and are able to summon spirits. <br/>What kind of enemies and troubles should they face? <br/>which goals they use to pursue? <br/>Should they be human after all?<br/><br/>TINKER (STR)<br/><br/>Whenever you try to kick down a lock, or handle technology by hitting it, roll + str.<br/>On a 10+, you do it, no problem.<br/>On a 7-9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between a cost, danger, and suspicion.<br/><br/><br/>LOCKING MINDS (INT)<br/><br/>Whenever you confront someone using your psychic powers, roll +int.<br/>On a 10, you get a hold on your opponent, you deal damage or you can ask the GM any question about your foe; he'll answer you truthfully, and <br/><br/>you take +1 when acting on the answer. You deal +1d6 damage by exposing to a soft move.<br/><br/>On a 7-9, you still do it, but you're vulnerable to the enemy's mind: GM will give you two options between damage, debility or giving <br/><br/>information to your foe.<br/><br/>WITHSTAND DAMAGE (CHA)<br/><br/>Whenever you must endure a situation, or are left at 0 HP, roll +cha.<br/>On a 10+, you scratch away the damage by saying a cool one-liner or revealing an unexpected advantage (make up one). If you have 0 HP or <br/><br/>less, raise it to 1. On a 7-9, the GM may impose a cost, or make you choose between two.<br/><br/>SUMMONING (DEX)<br/><br/>Whenever you dance from start to finish one of the 1000 dances, roll +dex<br/>On a 10+, the spirit whose dance you've performed will answer a demand within it's domain. <br/>On a 7-9, the GM will offer you two options between overexertion, costs, attracting troubles or other spirits, or retaining control.<br/>On a miss, the spirit may use this chance you to fulfill his own agenda; with or without taking control over your body.<br/><br/><br/>DEFY DANGER<br/><br/>When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, you roll...<br/><br/>...+INT if you use pure thought or your mind force.<br/>...+CHA if you claim a relevant quirk or invulnerability (Make up one: If you achieve a hit, things are like you say, at least for this time).<br/>...+DEX if you rely on your agility<br/>...+STR if you use your raw force.<br/><br/>On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn\u2019t come to bear. <br/>On a 7-9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443247/#Comment_443247" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T17:15:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  5:15PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not so fond of choose one from a list of don'ts.

Do you like this approach?<br/><br/>I'm also thinking on other way to use INT as the main combat mod: By the means of RIDDLE DUELS!<br/><br/>The move should be something like:<br/><br/>"When you ask or are asked a world riddle staring in the eyes of yor foe in a clear riddle contest, speak your question-answer and roll+INT.<br/><br/>On a 10+, your answer is right (yes, whatever answer you said, that's the answer, your GM will make it work!) or your opponent failed to answer your riddle. This means that <del>you roll your damage</del> your opponent must grant you a demand, or be dishonored.<br/>On a 7-9, your answer is only partly right; or your question feels somewhat cheap and tricky. You win this time, but someone will hold a grudge against you; or it takes a cost or a promise to assure your victory.<br/>On a miss, you fail your answer (no matter how fitting you thought it was, your GM will build the world around it) or the opponent guesses your answer. Now you ow a demand to your adversary or face dishonor.<br/>Riddles in this game are more questions about the fictional world rather than complicated wordplays. This way, you also worldbuild.<br/>Example: <br/>NPC: "What there is in the top of the highest peak of the black mountains?"<br/>PC: "A chair" <br/>-rolls a 3-<br/>NPC: "Not any longer. I took that chair last winter and now there is only snow. You ow me a boon: get out of my yard and don't you ever come back"<br/><br/>As a note: being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dishonored</span> is a status. All dishonored PCs suffer -1 to all rolls until they redeem somehow. All rolls against a dishonored NPC have a +1.<br/><br/><br/>So, which one is cooler? we go with psykers or riddle contests?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443308/#Comment_443308" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T08:55:03+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  8:55AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the rewrites.

It will usually imply the player activelly saying that he puts his faith in his star; and though it potentially perform miracles when all odds are against one, it also has a heavy backslash, as the GM has a lot of freedom picking the fitting hard move on a miss, because "it's fate".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443417/#Comment_443417" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T08:28:11+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  8:28AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>2097 - yeah, i'm thinking on taking out damage rolls from the game and leaving only debilities (-1 to stats) or any other bad status</blockquote>\nI meant the other way around, but that might work better actually.<br/>Maybe I just think debility sounds so harsh.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn" title="Cuchulainn"><img alt="Cuchulainn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443474/#Comment_443474" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T13:01:11+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  1:01PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>2097 - yeah, i'm thinking on taking out damage rolls from the game and leaving only debilities (-1 to stats) or any other bad status</blockquote>\nI meant the other way around, but that might work better actually.<br/>Maybe I just think debility sounds so harsh.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nWell, we can always call them "conditions", like in lady blackbird.<br/><br/>I'll summarize what we know about the world, given our moves. Remember that the first goal of this thread is to picture a world in which this moves make sense (just the opposite of how a game should be made!)<br/><br/>-Physical combat is not a common thing.<br/>-Everyone (or at least PCs) can summon spirits to cast different magics for them, at the expense of spending time dancing.<br/>-There is some technology around, but not everybody knows how to use it, so they kick it into work<br/>-Everybody has a twisted past which they can reveal bit by bit to prevent injuries.<br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
