                    Give me a rocking moment at your gaming table and the mechanics that made it so if the moment is play related.  Non-play related mechanical moments could include good food, a good joke or I dunno, surprise me.<br/>
<br/>
If comments on one particular game are going to go any longer than, "Cool!" please take it to its own thread.<br/>
<br/>
Here's mine, from last night's weekly Burning Wheel game:<br/>
<br/>
Aaron's bad-ass sword-wielding elf had killed (almost) every damned opponent I'd put on the table in ONE HIT. Son of a bitch.<br/>
<br/>
The Dwarven Traitor to the Troll Warlord...one hit.<br/>
<br/>
Fuck that.<br/>
<br/>
His brother, the Raven King of the North, was being choked, hung from the rafters by a whip that was held by He Who Rules by Whip, Sword and Spell, the biggest, baddest Orc in the campaign, an NPC listed in the back of the Burning Wheel book.<br/>
<br/>
They fenced for a little while, circled, parried, let their armor do a little work for them and then, at the same moment they went for the Great Strike, the most brutal hit possible in the Burning Wheel system. When Aaron saw my script and I saw his we high-fived, knowing full well that it might mean death for his beloved character.<br/>
<br/>
Great Strike allows the player to either add to the power of the hit or add to the hits ability to penetrate armor. They both went for the armor penetration.<br/>
<br/>
And they both got it.<br/>
<br/>
Aaron got lucky, he was just maimed, sword stuck through his chest.<br/>
<br/>
He Who Rules was not so lucky, his sword arm was chopped off and the blow continued on through his chest, stuck in his sternum.<br/>
<br/>
Aaron's elf, The Herald of the Dawn, collaposed in his brother's arms and his brother called for a healer. It took him four months to recover from his wounds, one iota short of death.<br/>
<br/>
When Aaron's bad-ass elf, The Herald of the Dawn, took down He Who Rules with Whip, Sword and Spell, I realized right then that I need never see an elf fight an orc at my gaming table again. It will never be cooler than that for me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
What I really liked about the fights I had in this session is that there weren't any bells and whistles. It was just mechanics driven play.<br/>
<br/>
I attacked the PC's Beliefs with big ugly orcs, clean and simple. I didn't have to make the PC's fight on upright logs or set the house on fire or fill a room up with water. I just had orcs attack your beliefs. Bam!  BW's Fight! mechanics did the rest for me.<br/>
<br/>
Now I feel like I've got Fight! down as much as I have Duel of Wits. Next up (though not this campaign) is Range &amp; Cover. This is prompting me to cultivate the Troll Hunt mini-scenario after school chills out.<br/>
<br/>
Fun.                </div>

                            Not exactly recent, but it still sticks in my mind. <br/>
<br/>
The game is InSpectres. The franchise is based in Milpitas, one of the most archetypally suburban suburbs of the SF bay area. One of the investigators is a bored housewife who joined up with the agency to get herself out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
In the 'gear up' phase of the mission, she activates her specialty die to buy the team a set of wheels: A Chevy Yukon.<br/>

                            At some point last week, Josh K, Thomas, and I got Shreyas to run another session of our ongoing, irregular Exalted 2ed IRC game.<br/>
<br/>
It was crazy.  Josh's character, Veil-of-Ivory, pretended to be pregnant with my character (Saadi)'s magical artifact boot (he only has one boot), which she was trying to steal.  Saadi put his ear against her fake tummy and said, "I think I can feel something kicking..."  Ivory replied, "Oh, he must take after his father."  We were throwing Fanmail around despite the fact that we weren't playing PTA.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when we got to the action sequence of the scene, where people chased each other around and fell into thickets of briars and stuff... nobody bothered to roll any dice or invoke any mechanics.  No Charms, no special powers, no essence, no attributes or abilities.  Everyone was just on the exact same page about "what should happen next" that they didn't want to risk the rules to potentially resolve it in a less interesting or appropriate way (speculation).<br/>
<br/>
Once it was done, Josh said something like:  "Should we be worried about the fact that we ignored the rules?  Doesn't system matter?"<br/>
<br/>
System does matter.  But, sometimes, when a team is playing hot, you don't wanna call time out and slow things down.  If they're in a groove, by all means, LET THEM PLAY.                        </div>

                            Not very recent, but hey... it still rocks me! It's a PTA sci-fi series, and it's the end of the season, maybe the last scene of the episode, where the PCs are fleeing a doomed ship about to go Big Bang. One of them is now running for the escape shuttle she has ready in the docking bay while under heavy fire, after having risked her life to go back and bring the people she loves with her.<br/>
<br/>
So this character has been involved in a intense love triangle with her fiancÃƒÂ© and a woman (that curiously, started out the series as her hated Nemesis) and, so far, she hasn't really really really been forced to choose one over the other. Everybody at the table has been dying to know how the player will finally resolve the situation, because it seems it can go either way... the player herself, whenever pressed by us, says she doesn't know how it will turn out.<br/>
<br/>
So, are we gonna let the season end without settling this once and for all? Surely not. Even if we later can't scrounge a personal scene where the other two parts of the triangle beat a decision out of our heroine, at least we, the players, are gonna find out who our fellow player loves the most before the season ends.<br/>
<br/>
Non-canonical PTA conflict resolution follows. I set up 3 different simultaneous conflicts for that player: one for each of the NPCs that were running with her to the shuttle (her father, her fiance, and her lover). At stake was the sucessful escape of each of the NPCs. As the producer, I told the player upfront I would only roll one die for each of the conflicts. As for her, she would get her one screen presence die for each of the conflicts, plus, she could divide up her limited Fan Mail and Traits/Connections dice in whatever way she saw fit between the three.<br/>
<br/>
After a few minutes of the player working things out inside her heart, this was the result we got: she left her father with only the 1 default die, her fiance got an extra die making 2, and her lesbian lover got a total of 4 dice. And finally, finally, finally dear God, now everybody at the table knows who's more important to the character/player! Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
The story would end here, but the dice on the table still had an additional magic to work on us. We start rolling them: it's only a 50-50 chance, but the father goes through the small arms crossfire unharmed; the fiance has much better odds and makes it through too; as for the lover, who we all have just found out to be the love of the player character's life, four dice againt one roll get nothing better than a tie, and the tie-breaker roll rules in the Producer's favor... the NPC is shoot and goes down!<br/>
<br/>
The look, the expression, on the player's face was just priceless. We had an endless suply of  heart wrenching moments from that series, but that one... it just topped them all! Just perfect for the season's finale. What a way to go!<br/>
<br/>
It broke my heart breaking PTA's rules, but it was so worth it. And so far, I have only gone beyond the rules again to pull a very similar stunt (with the same player, in her spotlight episode of the second season of the same series).<br/>
<br/>
And that's my story.                        </div>

                            Dogs at Orc Con.  New player.  She's just walked into the room, sat down, took up the Orphan-concept character sheet and assigned dice.  We're doing her Accomplishment.  I have completely forgotten what her Accomplishment was, but at the end of it, the scary-as-fuck wilderness-bitten crusty old Dog trainer tells her that she did good, takes off his coat, and gives it to her.  This new player's eyes go wide like saucers.<br/><br/>It's half an hour into the game, she already knows how significant that simple action is, and she is totally <em>hooked</em>.  It was a beautiful thing.                        </div>

                            Nine Worlds on Saturday. We have a conflict between Mr. Teapot's character and an NPC, who's trying to get Artemis to get the PC destroyed for being in violation of ecological balance statutes (he returned from the dead). This is because the NPC married the PC's wife while he was dead, and doesn't appreciate the competition. MT wins the conflict and we narrate a scene where the NPC and PC agree that their animosity should be kept between the two of them, and that they'll fight it out with no outsiders and let the wife pick the winner. <br/>

That was pretty darn cool. :)                        </div>

Two PC's got into a brutal fight over the corpse of a former PC who turned to the Dark Side.<br/>
<br/>
One was the corpse's brother, who didn't want the other PC to take the head and thus desecrate the body.  They had a nasty fight in a burning castle, with the fires making the fight more difficult and eventually would have made them pass out.<br/>
<br/>
The brother is wounded and fails his Steel test, elects to fall to his knees and begs for mercy.<br/>
<br/>
Mercy granted.<br/>
<br/>
Next game is our last.  I can't wait to have closure on this tale and move on to other games.  It has been fun.<br/>
<br/>
C'mon, folks, more cool gaming moments.                        </div>

<p>So the Dogs were chasing after this 15-year-old pseudo-Eastern-European immigrant kid (who was posessing/possessed by a demon axe and had killed 2 watchdogs and other innocents); the thing is that this kid ran away from his hometown after this group of Dogs had more or less humiliated him and his family in the course of a judgement. The conflict is a chase sequence through the forest.</p>
<p>Me: "Raise 8. With infernal speed he's sprinting accross the river, hoping you'll lose track of him there."<br/>
Him: "See 8. As he's going accross the river, the axe gets heavier and heavier, and he's just dragging it along."</p>
<p>I'm like "huh?" and he explains: it's a common trope in such stories that evil things cannot cross running water (ex: Vampires). (In fact, I think this is more frequent in particularly Eastern European folk tales.) I think that's just fantastic, and fold to the next raise out of awesomeness. The sorceror hefts up the axe and faces off against the Dogs in the middle of this swiftly running river.</p>

                            There were some rocking moments in the final session of our DitV game.  Four Dogs were in a big show down with some cult members.  It started calm, with the cult members trying to keep up the pretence that they were pillars of the community and the Dogs trying to get the townsfolk to turn on them and lynch them.  There was one character I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t strongly linked into stuff when I was creating this town.  He was a former Chinese miner, who converted to the Faith and became a Dog.  He still carries some mining tools with him.  Anyway, the player is struggling to See the cultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest Raise, and he suddenly has this character pull out a mining pick and smash the stone floor of the church, rolling the dice for his pick, and his miner trait.  The player then narrates, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I shatter the stone, revealing a cavity behind that holds a book.  I pull it out and hold it up so everyone can see itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a blasphemous book of corrupt worship!Ã¢â‚¬Â  It was great!<br/>
<br/>
The same conflict ended up escalating to gun fighting and three Dogs went down badly injured.  The Dog left standing, who was trying to heal them, started uncertain in her faith and with traits like Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a mole within the Dogs, looking for proof of their corruption.Ã¢â‚¬Â  In the session, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d discovered a former Dog gone bad and become a member of a cult, who was also possibly her father, and that her mother, another former Dog, may have been an adulterer.  Anyway, the conflict to heal the first of her fellows Dogs is going badly, and the player is avoiding using sees and raises that smack of faith healing.  SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s low on dice and suddenly she changes tactics and gets out the Book of Life, the sacred earth and so on.  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re knee deep in both the trappings of the Faith, and a spiritual battle to keep the guy alive.  She wins in the end, but takes some fallout.  The player adds a trait like Faith in Desperation 1d4 for the next conflict.  Which is another healing one for another fellow Dog on deathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s door.  Again, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hard conflict and this time the player dives straight into the faith healing Raises and Sees, and uses her temporary trait bang up front.  And also her trait about feeling guilty, as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling guilty about this faith sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling in desperation.  She wins again, only just, and takes more fallout.  Another temporary trait at 1d4.  So she takes the same trait again.  And moves to healing the third Dog.  That was a much easier conflict and she won without having to fight hard.  At the end the player remarked how cool it was that her character who started out looking for proof that the Dogs as an organisation where a sham, found something that could support that, but found genuine faith and the belief that she was doing good as a Dog in the end.  It was very nice.  If only we hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been too tired to revel in it properly.<br/>

                            From last weekend's WHFRP game. <br/><br/>Our characters -- Anders (me), Jurgen (Jon) and Lisl (my wife Allison) have spotted a Beastman camp in which a bunch of humans are being held prisoner. There are tons and tons of Beastmen in it, Centigors ... and a Minotaur. We know that they're preparing for something big, and we're pretty sure they're about to sacrifice the captives. We do a bunch of Magnificent Seven stuff, we rope in various local factions to help, etc., etc. <br/><br/>But in the end it comes down to it that Lisl has to sneak into the camp and free the captives. Obviously, this is impossible because the place is crawling with Beastmen. We're going to have to provide a distraction. <br/><br/>(Backstory: Jurgen, Lisl and Anders grew up in the same small town when they were kids. They all left, and then returned many years later for the funeral of a friend. Ever since then, they've been companions, and their bickering and fighting is really the engine of the game. In particular, Jurgen and Anders, a civilized scholar and a grimy engineer, are always doing their two-dogs-in-a-small-room act, with Lisl as their sort of big sister.)<br/><br/>So we come up with the World's Dumbest Plan. Jurgen, a fire wizard, has a spell that makes people angry, and we know that minotaurs are unstable engines of fury. We figure that we're going to sneak toward the camp, cast the spell on the minotaur, he'll go bugfuck and start smashing beastmen, the beastmen will spot us and charge out of the camp to attack, and while that's happening Lisl and her guys will sneak in the other side and free the hostages. <br/><br/>Except the spell has a 12-yard range, and the camp is like 40, 50 yards from cover. We've got archers waiting in the trees, and we've got these ridiculous beastman costumes we made from the skins of a patrol that attacked us, but even so we're going to have to run like hell to make it to cover before they get us. <br/><br/>Out of game, we know that Warhammer movement is fixed -- the Centigors, who are faster than we are, will simply run us down unless we can delay them. But we have to do it anyway. <br/><br/>So here we are, with these Beastman skins on us (to stop their senses of smell detecting us, actually, which had happened before), about to walk out to sacrifice our lives to cause this distraction, just two guys with a blunderbuss and some magic, and Jurgen turns to Anders and says "well ... it was nice knowing you."<br/><br/>And as they start to walk out, Jon says, still speaking for Jurgen, in this quiet surprised little voice, "you know, it actually was."<br/><br/>Mechanically ... the constraints provided by the range, the effectiveness of the spell, our knowledge of what those centigors would do to us if they caught us. But also, I don't know, the <i>feel</i> of the game. Jon, Luke and I all played first edition WHFRP (we're gamers + we're British (sort of in my case)  = we've played WHFRP) and we all seem to have imbued it with the same sort of slightly whacky, caper-movie kind of feel. A lot of what we do has this quality, and I think it's part of a sort of tradition associated with the game that isn't expressed in toto in any one document. <br/><br/>I think a lot of older games have that, and it has a lot to do with how they're played.                        </div>

<i>But ... but ...<br/><br/>WHAT HAPPENED!?<br/><br/>I mean, did Jurgen and Anders get crunched?<br/><br/>I gotta know!</i><br/><br/>Well, it was actually the "nice to know you" moment that I thought was cool. <br/><br/>In fact, we went out there, got spotted, and started to run <i>toward</i> the camp. As we got closer, we saw that the Beastmen were already forming up to leave the camp and attack the village we were supposed to be protecting. Oh snap!<br/><br/>Jurgen got his spell off and the Minotaur went berserk, smashing Beastmen left and right with its axe and chasing the Beastman leader all over the camp. Without the leader, they weren't certain what to do, but the Centigors, being impetuous, gave chase. We turned and ran like hell for the cover of the woods. <br/><br/>So as the Centigors got closer, we were throwing everything we had at them, including these little tanglefoot globes we'd picked up in a previous session. These didn't catch the Centigors, but they had to go around them and so they were unable to catch us before we made it close enough to the woods that the archers could lay down covering fire. Jurgen started throwing fireballs, the archers were shooting, and our cavalry (that is, our five guys on horses) attacked the Centigors in the flank. <br/><br/>That's when the gors did what I hadn't been expecting -- realizing they were in a trap, they bugged out. Which was quite a reasonable thing to do under the circumstances. There was no way they were going to chase us through the woods where our archers could snipe at them, and although they beat up our cavalry pretty good, every round that they remained in the open was another round the archers were going to keep shooting, and eventually they were going to get nickel-and-dimed to death. So they just turned tail and headed back for the camp. I don't think we even killed any, although I know we wounded one or two pretty badly. <br/><br/>So in fact, despite the tension, we were completely unharmed. Good news for me, since Anders had 4 Wounds left after the fight with the beastman patrol and one good hit would have killed him. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lisl got into the camp and freed all but one of the hostages, who were indeed being sacrificed to summon Pink Horrors. Unfortunately, the shaman's bodyguard caught her at it and hacked her with his evil rune-marked sword, leaving her at one wound before she finally brought him down, spending Fortune Points like pocket change and Swift Attacking like mad. So we went into the final fight with our two fighters at five and two Wounds, respectively. <br/><br/>Later on, when the Beastmen attacked the camp, Jurgen actually charged the minotaur, barehanded, in order to hit it with a Sleep spell (the damn thing may have 3 Attacks and tons of Strength and Toughness, but it's got a WP of 24. Sucker). It fell back into the ditch in front of the parapet, and Anders leapt over the wall and slid down into the ditch to bash its skull in with his trusty sledgehammer. Unfortunately, this meant he was stuck in the ditch with the beastmen's champions, which was a bit hairy. They kept hitting me in the head, for which I was perversely  very grateful, since my trusty helmet and high Toughness kept me from dying. <br/><br/>In the long run, we all survived, the Beastmen were routed, the demon was dispelled, etc., etc., and the Experience Points flowed like wine. <br/><br/>"... and that was how I learned to speak Khazalid."<br/><br/>"by beating in a bull-man's head?"<br/><br/>"Yeah. Good times."                        </div>

                            God, it's hard to tell a story about a character who's in the middle of a long-term game without either making no sense or sounding like the game is made of CHEESE.  Nonetheless, I am going to try, since this was a really great moment.<br/><br/>This is a birth-to-death <i>Ars Magica</i> one-on-one game.  My character, Basilia, has had an ongoing battle with a powerful demon since she was about eight, when she became a victim of one of his plots.  He can't touch her directly because she's <i>very</i> pious, but she's not powerful enough to actually hurt him, so they basically try to screw up each other's plans.  At this point she's leading the Guernicus and is trying to get the Order to care more about demons (among other things), but Chris is playing the Order as having gotten fat, lazy and corrupt.  It's fun.<br/><br/>In any case, she goes to the Mount Etna covenant because she suspects that some of the magi there have been corrupted by the demon.  This covenant is built on the edge of the volcano, and when she arrives, no one is there.  After some investigation, she discovers a secret door down into the bowels of the volcano, where the four corrupt magi of the covenant have murdered their un-corrupted peers and are praying for the demon to rise and save them, in front of a big, black stone which Basilia thinks is the demon's altar.<br/><br/>Basilia hears these magi say incriminating things, but before she can try to arrest them, the demon appears.  It seems that he'd taken up residence in the pit of the volcano after being driven out of his last home.  The demon and Basilia end up in a war of words.  Basilia's trying to save the souls of the men, while the demon is trying to convince them that if they show their faith in him by leaping into the pit of the volcano, he'll save and protect them.<br/><br/>This is where my partner got mean.<br/><br/>One of the demon-worshiping magi starts shouting about how Basilia is just going to have them all executed by Tribunal for worshipping demons, and then she leaps over the edge.  Basilia starts screaming at the other three to wait - but she <i>does</i> plan to have them tried and executed, and refuses to lie to them about it, and so two more leap off, putting their faith in the demon rather than face justice.  There's just one more magus left, and he's wavering.  Basilia rushes forward and struggles with him on the edge of the pit, trying to physically stop him from going to what she believes to be a fate worse than death.  Of course, she's a total wuss so he easily overpowers her physically, but when he realizes that she's just risked her life to save his soul (since he could easily have tossed her into the lava) he decides to surrender and be judged by Tribunal.<br/><br/>I could have had the character leave with her prize, since she knows she can't even hurt the demon, but then I thought of something HARDCORE . . . .<br/><br/>Tired, wounded and furious, Basilia turns to the demon.  "I may not have been able to save those men," she said, "but at least I can prevent others from falling to you."  And then she destroys the big black rock that's the demon's altar with her magic sword, which was established to have big Perdo Terram effects.  <br/><br/>(Brief not-quite-digression: using the sword gave the act a huge amount of resonance with their previous encounters.  After finding the sword, she wounded the demon with it, as it's immensely powerful - though she can't swing a sword for the life of her, which is the main reason why the blow didn't kill him.  Then he attacked her apprentice, murdered her protege and stole the sword.  Finally, not one week of game-time before this encounter, Basilia's son had taken up the sword to use in the service of the demon against her, and she'd lost most of her left arm in the encounter - not to mention almost killing her beloved youngest son whom the demon has corrupted.  She did, however, manage to get the sword back again!)<br/><br/>In any case, Basilia points the sword at the rock and speaks the command word . . . and my partner asks if HE can be HARDCORE.  Of course I say yes . . .<br/><br/>The rock explodes into tiny, tiny shards . . . and the demon <i>laughs</i>.  "You think you've destroyed my altar?" he asked.  "That was put there by Verditius himself to ward this place - and now you've done yourself more harm than I could ever do you."  The demon disappears as the lava starts to rise, and the group starts to run out of the cavern, trying to stay ahead of the coming eruption.  It was bad.  But oh, so, so good!<br/><br/>In the end, everyone made it out alive (mostly thanks to Basilia's hoplite physically picking her up and throwing her over his shoulder), but the covenant was destroyed, with even its aura being gone.  Nonetheless, it was a fantastic, dramatic, rocking scene - and I'm so grateful that I have a play partner with whom I can run things like that, not just once in a while, but every damn time we play.<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: I apologize if this sounds like cheese.  I swear, every element in that game came out of about a real-time year of play, and is grounded in concrete things that the character did and had done to her.                        </div>

                            Not cheesy at all.  It sounds ... <br/>
<br/>
hardcore.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you folks to answer when you post these moments...<br/>
<br/>
Do they ever happen the first session of a game?                        </div>

                            Hmm.  Yes and no, for me: what makes a moment really awesome for me is how it plays into the larger story arc of the game, and the resonance it has with past encounters and the future of the characters involved.  Plenty of dramatic things happen in first sessions, but they don't mean as much to me as the dramatic things that happen in the middle of the story.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>I'll try to think of a rocking moment from a first session (when I next need to procrastinate) and post it here, to illustrate the difference.  But I think it has to do with meaning and context.  The same act can be way cooler if it has layers of resonance and history to it . . . .<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess, <br/><br/>I'd say there were some pretty rocking moments in the first game of Bitches.                        </div>

                            Jess, yes, that makes all kinds of sense to me; that the meaning and resonance and history of "campaign" play adds to the value of the rockin' moments that happen after some investment of time in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I ask, in order to refute those who say that any height to which campaign play can achieve, one-shot play can aspire; the "Fun Now!" movement.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not here to argue that point; that should go in another thread.  So just keep posting those moments.                        </div>

                            True . . . but compare that to how rocking we're going to get once we hit the road together!!  <br/><br/>Seriously, I can't really think of any examples where I've rocked out <i>more</i> in the first session than I did later in the game.  Usually mid-game play makes the first session look embarassingly anemic - not because the plot isn't awesome, but because it doesn't and can't mean as much to the player or character.<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: I now return you to your regularly scheduled rockage.  Vax, if I feel the need to rant further on this topic, I'll start a new thread.                        </div>
