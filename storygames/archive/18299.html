We often get at least as much XP from failure as from end-of-session awards, and it is the reward that is most immediate and concrete.  Personally, I'll thus tend to savor failures as advancement - I'll say "Yes!" loudly and/or high-five others when we fail.  David doesn't like this, though.  He finds it backwards to be rewarded for failure, and doesn't engage in this.  <br/><br/>If we see XP as a Pavlovian reward, it does seem like the "best" session is one where the PCs fail a lot but still manage to muddle through enough to overcome a "notable" opponent.  I don't mind this, but I can see David's point.  <br/><br/>Have other posters seen people who didn't engage with XP-for-failure?  Are there variants that people have tried?                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412481/#Comment_412481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T17:12:22+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  5:12PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's an XP variation that our local crew uses when we ran Living Dungeon World.  The thinking here is that Dungeon World should be a game of heroic deeds and action so the XP system rewards that.  It breaks types of actions down into two categories with each three sub-categories.<br/><br/>Category A<br/><br/>Attack, Stunt &amp; Defend<br/><br/>Category B<br/><br/>Discover, Converse, Aid<br/><br/>Then we use the Highlighting rules from Apocalypse World.  The player with most significant bond chooses one to highlight.  Then the GM chooses one from the OTHER category to highlight.<br/><br/>When you do a thing in a highlighted sub-category you get XP.<br/><br/>I can't remember who exactly was responsible for developing this.  I think originally it was just the six sub-categories.  I remember being physically present when it was decided to sort them into two broader categories and to highlight one from A and one from B.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412485/#Comment_412485" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-23T18:12:15+00:00" title="April 23, 2013  6:12PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like that no matter what, when the dice come out, I'll get my way or something interesting will happen or I'll get XP - every time!

I would also add that it helps if you're only rolling the dice when it really matters. If the GM soft move was <b>show signs of doom  </b> and avoiding the doom is the reason the PC is making the move, then failure means DOOM -- presumably it's something the PC would genuinely want to avoid. If the GM soft move was <b>offer an opportunity with or without a cost</b>, failure means the opportunity is lost, the cost is high, and the PC is probably in a very dicey situation. Don't just roll willy nilly because the characters are looking around or whatever. Roll because something is on the line. <br/><br/>Also, if the PLAYER is happy about getting XP because that's what the PLAYER wants in the longrun, I don't see that as a problem so long as the character in the fiction is soundly beaten up as a result of failure. Even when my guy is crumpled at the bottom of a pit with a spike through his leg, I cheer a little when I get XP too. What's the big deal? <br/><br/>(That said, I like quest based XP too -- mostly because it's easier to keep track.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412538/#Comment_412538" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T08:56:32+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  8:56AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those of you who use "Quest XP", how do you do it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412539/#Comment_412539" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T09:05:52+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  9:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing that I love about XP on a failure is that it encourages risk taking.

Most often the consequence for a single failure is taking a single damage roll or an equivalent setback in positioning - i.e. like we don't see an enemy coming and he gets a free shot on us if we fail a Discern Reality.  We keep trying for opportunities to Spout Lore, but after the first session or two, now the GM is loath to allow us to roll it.  <br/><br/>I'm OK with the XP-for-failure rule overall, but I do think it puts more of burden on the GM to be the gatekeeper.  i.e. The players try to get rolls with as little long-term consequence as possible, and the GM opposes this, doling out rolls while trying to be fair between the players and for the party as a whole.  <br/>\n<blockquote>Also, if the PLAYER is happy about getting XP because that's what the PLAYER wants in the longrun, I don't see that as a problem so long as the character in the fiction is soundly beaten up as a result of failure. Even when my guy is crumpled at the bottom of a pit with a spike through his leg, I cheer a little when I get XP too. What's the big deal? <br/><br/>(That said, I like quest based XP too -- mostly because it's easier to keep track.)</blockquote>\nMany players don't like a strong divide between player and character view, which I think is a valid preference.  In the case of our particular game, my character often acts stupidly, which often sets him up for failure.  He's a Chaotic Thief, so his alignment move is "Leap into danger without a plan."  He's also a greedy jerk.  I think this contributes to something of an ironic feel to play.  Another player Daniel has been getting the most XP, though, I think because he is a Druid and keeps using his magic, and the GM always has him roll for it.  The failures are consequential, steadily hampering him more and more.  Still, they don't kill him.  <br/><br/>In any case, I don't think it's helpful to tell David that his preference isn't valid.  He doesn't like the XP-for-failure rule, and doesn't seem likely to change his mind on this, so I suspect we'll try an alternate XP scheme soon for the sake of group harmony.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412565/#Comment_412565" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T12:31:48+00:00" title="April 24, 2013 12:31PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2013 12:32PM by AMBayard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't mean to imply that his preference was invalid. I understand that giving XP for failing rolls has some consequences that people might not like. (Personally, the issue that troubles me sometimes is that XP for failure creates the incentive to use Player Moves that aren't really in a character's wheel house. It's a little weird that if I make slow-witted barbarian thug and I want him to be good at charging into a room and bashing stuff without blinking, the best way for me to unlock even greater bashing abilities is by using entirely unrelated moves like spout lore.) <br/><br/>Ultimately though, XP is very abstract. It's so abstract that I don't worry about where it comes from. It's not really a reward. Neither the mechanical trigger, nor the thing you do in the fiction to get XP usually has anything to do with the actual effect of XP. <br/><br/>So, in my head, the character's personal improvement isn't directly related to the moments in the game when I failed rolls; it's just that the mechanical representation of my character's personal improvement (in the form of XP) happens to equal the number of failed rolls I had. It's just a coincidence. Why? Because . . . I don't know -- whatever. We have to get an XP number somehow, and failure is as good as anything else.

Giving XP for gold means that the players are more motivated to seek out gold.  Giving XP for failure means that the players are more motivated to fail.  For example, playing the Lord of the Rings RPG, where a fixed number of XP was given for completing a mission, which encouraged us to choose missions that were as short and concrete as possible.  <br/>\n<blockquote>So, Advancement isn't really about 'improving', it's mostly just about revealing new things about that character to the audience.<br/><br/>Like, in this episode, we learn/establish that Lux is a badass in trials of single combat. <br/><br/>XP is a pacing mechanic for the metaplot of the game.

In my experience thus far, what I reveal in ordinary play has been a lot more significant than what I reveal when leveling up.  For us, leveling up has primarily been about the mechanical benefits.

But note that while a character could potentially seek gold, a character can't really seek failure -- all the character can do is seek situations in which failure is possible. Risky situations. Which is consistent with what Sage wanted. You aren't really "seeking failure" because you might succeed! Which isn't so bad because there is more to the game than XP. I mean, wall to wall failure might get you loads of XP but it could also get you dead. <br/><br/>Really, character behavior doesn't change a whole lot if you give XP for 10+ instead of failure. Different moves become more important, but the character still has to take risks. So if you want to tie XP to a roll, you could do that. <br/><br/> I guess you could also say that XP happens on odd numbered rolls or something.

Reward for failure means you are encouraged to get rolls on moves with a high chance of failure, while reward for success is the opposite.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412637/#Comment_412637" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T06:13:34+00:00" title="April 25, 2013  6:13AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can appreciate your line of thinking and comments, jhkim (and love this conversation you've started... very intriguing). At the table, I've found rewarding a highlighted stat to be cool in theory and less cool in practice. I've seen players push and push for rolls on one or two stats because they're going after that advance rather than legitimately trying to make things happen in response to the fiction. I've a) resented their grandstanding and b) resented the MC for giving in and letting them make a ton of rolls, typically on stats they're good at. End result? Less fun as one player hogs the spotlight. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, rewarding failure has been lots more fun. Players take risks, go for it, and wow, that roll sucked ass. So the MC/GM gets to make a move, maybe a really hard move, on the player or even on another player (love that) as the story takes a tough turn _and_ the player gets an XP. The story gets more challenging and the character is that much closer to increasing agency in challenging circumstances. End result? More fun for everyone involved.<br/><br/>I like the immediacy of it, too. I use colored poker chips for XP and it's just plain fun as the GM when the player blows a roll (groans around the table) to sit back with that "Oh boy, am I gonna mess with y'all" look on my face while I flip a poker chip to the player. It's a little like I'm paying him/her for the chance to lay down some fuckery and that just feels satisfying to me.<br/><br/>David in your group has a different style, I can respect that, but IMO he's missing out on a great way of interacting.

However, the consequences of a failed roll typically aren't crippling like a lost limb.  Most often the consequence for a single failure is taking a single damage roll or an equivalent setback in positioning - i.e. like we don't see an enemy coming and he gets a free shot on us if we fail a Discern Reality.  <b>We keep trying for opportunities to Spout Lore, but after the first session or two, now the GM is loath to allow us to roll it. </b><br/></blockquote>\nNot to derail your discussion, but this paragraph rather suggests that you have bigger problems than one player happening to not like XP on a failure.</blockquote>\nI'm not claiming that the topic I chose is our only problem, but it is the point of most contention among the players.  From your highlighting of the last sentence in my paragraph, I guess you think that the Spout Lore rolls are a problem?  <br/><br/>It's kind of a tricky aspect of the game, but we're taking a sort of medium route that we aren't too dissatisfied with.  During the first session or two, we would frequently Spout Lore - which seems kind of natural since it was an all-new game world, and we knew very little about it.  As it came out, though, the results of our first implementation were:<br/><br/>(a) it is hard to come up with any major negative consequences for a character consulting his own memory; <br/>(b) as a result, these rolls resulted in a bunch of XP for little risk, especially for characters with low Int;<br/>(c) success meant that the GM goes into exposition to give the useful and/or interesting information. <br/><br/>For later sessions, the GM has avoided giving Spout Lore rolls.  Instead, he either gives information without a roll, or he asks a player the background question and they answer it.  So, for example, my character is on the run from the Duke of Tennish - so he asks me about what the Duke's elite troops are like, how their airships work, and so forth.  <br/><br/>I'd be curious about other peoples' take on Spout Lore.  How often do players take the move?

If I take a risk and get into trouble, then I am taking on the spotlight - and it demands even more spotlight time to see how I get out of the trouble I landed in.  <br/><br/>In our games thus far, I think my thief Rat and Daniel's druid Thistle have been taking more risks, getting into trouble, and occupying more spotlight time than David's ranger Dambreth.  Rat often takes stupid risks.  As a Chaotic Thief, his alignment move is to leap into danger without a plan - and I'm regularly rolling on my bad stats.  Dambreth has been smarter, more often maximized his chance for success, and gotten less XP and spotlight time as a result.  <br/><br/>He still gets his chances to shine, and roughly as many rolls overall, but he's definitely lagging in XP.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412662/#Comment_412662" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T10:37:46+00:00" title="April 25, 2013 10:37AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  He still gets his chances to shine, and roughly as many rolls overall, but he's definitely lagging in XP.  </blockquote>\nThat sounds like a Han Solo vs Luke Skywalker situation to me, strangely enough.<br/><br/>Han starts competent, but basically sticks to what he's good at already for a long time.

That's what I've been saying. XP for failure encourages the use of weak stats. XP for success encourages the use of strong stats. XP for odd numbered rolls or something neutral like that encourages Player Moves generally but no particular stat. All versions work fine. <br/><br/>But, the bottom line is that linking XP to Player Moves -- however you do it -- encourages risk. I think it's worth defining our terms. As I understand the word "risk" for the purpose of this thread, it just means "rolling the dice." Rolling the dice is always risky because it always subjects you to a hard move. It doesn't necessarily mean "madcap hair-brained scheme." Making camp is "risky." Carousing is "risky." Linking XP to rolls encourages risk taking because it encourages characters to engage the system and, you know, have adventures. \n<blockquote><blockquote>At the table, I've found rewarding a highlighted stat to be cool in theory and less cool in practice.

The rules should take care of the "spotlight hogging" and "fair distribution of rolls" that you've mentioned without any special GM effort. <br/><br/>I've noticed that people tend to be excited and interested in Player Moves, but that they regard GM Moves as optional advice. I think that's a mistake. At least in my view, the Player Moves are only part of the equation, and the GM Moves are very important. I think fully implementing them may solve some of your problems. <br/><br/>The flow of play, as I understand it, starts with a GM Soft Move like <b>show signs of doom</b> or whatever. Then the player does something to deal with the Soft Move. If there are dangerous consequences to ignoring the Soft Move and the player ignores those consequences (with plenty of explicit warning), the GM has a "golden opportunity" and may make a GM Hard Move. If the player tries to prevent the doom (or seek the good thing or whatever), the player will typically use a Player Move. <br/><br/>If the player rolls a failure, the GM makes a GM Hard Move. If the Player is successful or partially successful, then the move dictates the result. <b>Either way</b>, the next thing that happens -- <b>and this is the part your GMs might have been missing</b> -- is that the GM makes A NEW GM Soft Move, and the process repeats.    <br/><br/>The result is that a character who is failing a lot shouldn't automatically be getting more "spot light" than the character who succeeds. It's the GM's JOB to make a new GM Soft Move in BOTH cases. The GM Moves, Agenda, and Principles keep the ball rolling no matter what happens.  It is not the GM's job to monitor how many Player Moves are being made or to monitor the Player Moves at all. The GM doesn't "distribute" rolls. Player Moves are outside of the GM's province. The GM just makes GM Moves. Soft ones most of the time and Hard ones when the rules say so. That's all. \n<blockquote><blockquote>jhkim, two things that may help with Spout Lore:<br/><br/>1) I can be kind of hardline about this sort of thing, but in Dungeon World (and other games powered by the Apocalypse) the GM does not have discretion in terms of allowing rolls.

What are the consequences for failure?  <br/></blockquote>\nIn our group, Spout Lore is the mechanical method by which characters gain information that the GM is not willing to just disclose automatically. It usually comes up when a character asks: "do I know [fill in the blank]?" If the GM decides that the answer to the question is either common knowledge or that it would be known to that character, the GM will just answer (or ask the character to narrate the answer). If it's something that would require technical or special knowledge, the GM will require a roll. In general, it doesn't make sense for the GM to be stingy about information unless there is some good reason. <br/><br/>Like everything else, the move has to follow the fiction. So, sometimes, it might not be possible for a character to know something. In that situation, the GM should say what the character must do in order to find the information. For example, maybe it's impossible for the characters to know what the weird writing over the doorway says but it IS possible for the characters to know where they can find the answer . . . if they make a Spout Lore roll. :P <br/><br/>Also, I agree with robb regarding the GM Hard Move on a Spout Lore failure. It's just like any other hard move. It has to flow logically from the fiction, but it doesn't actually have to be directly related to the Spout Lore move.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412740/#Comment_412740" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-25T23:25:30+00:00" title="April 25, 2013 11:25PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sharp line between soft moves and hard moves, and the very structure of when to use which, I think I've seen cropping up here and there. Myself, I haven't really felt it from the rules of AW or DW (I know Monsterhearts talks about it that way a bit, especially since it allows an NPC to 'come out of nowhere with a hard move'  under certain circumstances). To me, the key element to be able to make GM moves on any failed roll is: keep the situation dangerous or unknown.<br/><br/>If the players manage to get the entire dungeon under control, and can just stand around in a room thinking about stuff, they shouldn't be rolling for Spout Lore. Or rather, as the rules as written they trigger the move, but I wouldn't play out that scene. They're done with the dungeon. And if they're not, well then there's something left that could come out and attack them (or maybe more often, make its presence known (showing signs of doom)).<br/><br/>Something I'd like to talk about sometime when I've collected my thoughts on it is this thing about the MC/GM not distributing rolls in *W games. They're supposed to happen each and every time the trigger happens in the fiction.

To me, "soft" just means that the character still has the power to do something to change the outcome -- the "harder" the GM move, the less the character can do to avoid it (also, hard moves are bad for the character). In the case of a failed roll or a "golden opportunity" the GM can make the move as hard as they like -- including damage and dismemberment. So, while the "hardness" of a GM move on a failure is variable, I don't think a GM can permanently harm a character without first giving the character a "softer" opportunity to avoid the trouble . . . A scene that begins with all the characters taking 10d6 damage in a horrible explosion without warning would be counter to the rules I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412789/#Comment_412789" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T13:24:57+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  1:24PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If the players manage to get the entire dungeon under control, and can just stand around in a room thinking about stuff, they shouldn't be rolling for Spout Lore.

I could see changing it, but it would be a big shift.  <br/><br/>For example, last session we had a scene where we checked out the house of an old hermit who lived in the area and talked with him, then discussed with each other about what we wanted to do from there based on what he told us.

That usually means it\u2019s something not all that bad, like revealing that there\u2019s more treasure if they can just find a way past the golem (offer an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it\u2019s something bad, but they have time to avoid it, like having the goblin archers loose their arrows (show signs of an approaching threat) with a chance for them to dodge out of danger.<br/>A soft move ignored becomes a golden opportunity for a hard move. If the players do nothing about the hail of arrows flying towards them it\u2019s a golden opportunity to use the deal damage move.<br/>Hard moves, on the other hand, have immediate consequences.</blockquote> DW p.166<br/><br/>Seems pretty succinct? We play this way anyways. So when a player fails a roll, there is often a cheer of hope for the xp, but a definite outcry of depair at the hard move I'm most definately going to make. They always have desperate and irrevocable consequences. If stuck for inspiration, my favourite way of improvising is to ask another player what would be the worst possible thing to happen right now, and make it so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412847/#Comment_412847" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T04:44:59+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  4:44AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm curious about this, because it sounds like in your style, every scene is an action scene with the threat of violence in it.  i.e. There are no scenes where the characters are just talking, camping, etc.  Could you say a little more about what it's like? </blockquote>\nHmm, no, that's not really true. There is (or, there should be) no scenes where the characters are perfectly safe and in control. As a response to "hmm, what sort of hard move can I do on Spout lore?", the GM can make sure to always have something up their sleeve. Because if the players know everything about all the rooms, have killed all monsters, and start Spouting lore about the inscriptions on the wall, what happens on a miss? If they're safe, hard moves will feel forced.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, 'safe' is not the key word, 'in control' is. Or rather 'know that they are in control'. If I as a GM leave things unknown so that I can reveal an unwelcome truth or something, then I'm good. What I was trying to say I guess is "keep your options open for GM moves, so that you always have something to pull out on a miss \u2013 since some rolls don't come with an immediate risk in themselves (Spout lore)".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412871/#Comment_412871" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T10:23:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 10:23AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Spout Lore and similar moves are sometimes difficult in play because they do not have any "danger" built-in. Sometimes there really is no clear danger at hand, and making a move on a failure can feel creatively challenging to the GM/MC.<br/><br/>Note that this doesn't exist in AW: the psychic maelstrom is dangerous by default. When you open your brain, there's fictional justification for all kinds of bad shit to happen.<br/><br/>So here are some thoughts on possible solutions:<br/><br/>1. Making "spout lore" in to something dangerous. For instance, maybe Spouting Lore in your DW means communing with spirits or demons, or accessing some kind of weird magical resource (tapping into the dream world?).<br/><br/>2. Giving some thought to what kinds of things threaten the characters. What are your Grim Portents and Fronts? Can you advance them and announce off-screen badness (or the DW equivalent) when Spout Lore rolls are failed?<br/><br/>I could see setting into motion whatever threats or dangers are happening off-screen: even if it's a quiet scene, the MC is supposed to have brainstormed some danger somewhere around, can you make it more immediate? ("You hear drums in the deep...")<br/><br/>3. One way to make a "hard move" on a question which seeks information could be to reveal unwelcome information. <br/><br/>"Do I know anything about the mysterious runes?"<br/>"No, you can't decipher them, but you recognize the script. It looks like they were drawn by a sorcerer trained in Necromancy. This might mean one of them got here before you did..."<br/><br/>4. I wouldn't see a huge problem with a simple hack:<br/><br/>* On a failed Spout Lore roll, the MC can choose not to make a hard move. In this case, the player does not mark experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412876/#Comment_412876" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T11:38:40+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 11:38AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a very interesting conversation. (And BTW, I'm one of <a href="/forums/profile/jhkim%27s">@jhkim's</a> compatriots in the DW game.) What I'm having trouble wrapping my head around is that, from what <a href="/forums/profile/Noofy">@Noofy</a> is saying, there may not be a <i>direct causal relationship</i> between a player's failed roll and the GM's subsequent soft/hard move.<br/><br/>For example, I totally get that if I fail a Hack And Slash roll, the immediate consequence is likely to be that the GM (by way of my opponent) Deals Damage to me. I could also see that if I fail to Spout Lore about the inscriptions on the door, I might mistranslate them and lead us the wrong way down a corridor, using up our resources. (Also from p.166: "To choose a move, start by looking at the obvious consequences of the action that triggered it.")<br/><br/>But if a failed roll more generally gives the GM permission to make <i>something bad</i> happen, then there's not really a causal relationship anymore; it seems more like there's a notion of "karma" or "luck", and the failed roll generates bad mojo that the GM can thereafter use for whatever purpose. It almost feels like something that could be measured by physical tokens the GM accumulates. Is that accurate?<br/><br/>(This makes me think of the similar-but-different Lore Roll in On Mighty Thews, which is more of an explicit power of the players to make stuff up in the game-world. The degree of success merely indicates how many new 'facts' the player can make up, with a failure being zero. But on the other hand, you can only make Lore Rolls about new things that have just entered the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412877/#Comment_412877" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T11:52:17+00:00" title="April 27, 2013 11:52AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2013 11:52AM by Johnstone.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM's hard moves have to follow the fiction, but the fiction is the whole thing, and they should have something to do with the PCs obviously.

In fact this is the only way I've 'saved' Hard moves. So even though you are making the move now somewhere else in the fiction, the consequences on the characters may be withheld until appropriately revealed in the story. In fact I LOVE revealing the hard move (without speaking its name of course) when made to the players, sort of like an off-screen vingette for the audience. I then jot this down on a sticky note and place it down on the relationship / campaign map for all to see. I want this hard move to be a fictional big deal. This always seems to increase their tension as they <i></i><b>know </b>the scouts have reported back to the dark master, they <i></i><b>know </b>that future grimness is on its way due to their failure, they just don't know <i></i><b>when</b>. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413032/#Comment_413032" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T04:28:03+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  4:28AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In fact I LOVE revealing the hard move (without speaking its name of course) when made to the players, sort of like an off-screen vingette for the audience</blockquote>\nYes! This is something that I've failed to do in the past, keeping secrets from the players due to old GMing habits. John Harper alluded to this technique in another old thread and I'm delighted to see it confirmed here.

The word "reveal" implies it's unknown to the players (and the PCs) at the moment the badness is generated by the missed roll. I've had great success with poker chips in this regard. Player blows a roll, I reach for the red stack with a smile on my face. They all know some future badness is coming but I don't feel compelled to state exactly what it is right then. Heck, it might not have anything to do with the failed roll itself. But the tension rises knowing I have a coupon to toss some extra badness into the story to enhance the drama of the moment. I usually save up a couple or three to make a final scene even more dramatic.

I can't remember if they also say to use a poker chip but it rings a bell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413082/#Comment_413082" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T13:07:29+00:00" title="April 29, 2013  1:07PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not exactly clear what the difference is between "Make a note of and reveal it when the time is right" and "saving up moves." </blockquote>\nIt's the same as the difference between writing and sticking to your fronts and just winging it. In the case of "Make a not and reveal when the time is right," one way or another you've committed to the fiction ahead of time. The event is already set, and the players get to discover it in time. With "saving up moves", you make no move, nothing is set, and things are going get steamy later which is something you can do anyway. That said, if having the chips there is something that helps you create tension and your players love, that's fantastic and I hope you keep it up and don't let anyone say you're doing it wrong. I still think there is value in the difference between "this is what the rules say to do" and "this is my super awesome drift", though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18299/thoughts-on-dungeon-world-and-xp" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18299/thoughts-on-dungeon-world-and-xp" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18299/thoughts-on-dungeon-world-and-xp/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18299%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18299%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
