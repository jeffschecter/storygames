I realize this is old hat *rimshot* but it's the first time at a table I occupied.<br/><br/>The character background is a straight rip &amp; nod, so nothing really to say about that.<br/><br/>As for the build plan I picked Scout for the base class owing to the amount of exploration, running, movement based combat, skills, etc. I also really thought it was important to include the religious/mystical aspect, so included Cleric of Boccob with Knowledge and Magic for my domains which added a TON of synergy, especially regarding knowledge/academia. I felt I had to add one level of Wizard, just for a few spells to aid in 'Indyisms' (like animate rope, disguise self, jump, etc), and because I also really wanted a snake familiar (named him Short-Round). Finally we adapted the Loredelver PrC, allowing for divine spellcasters of non-Illumian descent (something we always thought the class deserved anyway since 'tomb-robbing' is inherently more of a clerical sphere than wizardly).<br/><br/>Nearly all of the planned adventures are research into mysteries, or Tomb Raideresque dungeon delves, all against the backdrop of the world war against the Axis of Evil (Great Kingdom, Iuz, &amp; the Scarlet Brotherhood). <br/><br/>So by the end he'll be a Human Scout 14/Cleric 5/Wizard 1/Lordelver 10 wielding whip and hand crossbow, wearing anachronistic leathers, using spells and skill tricks to create some cinematic goodness. It's not an optimized build by any means, but it's INCREDIBLY fun and very close to true for the character inspiration.<br/><br/>I wish more people played around with themes like this rather than min/maxing. It's crazy awesome. Thinking seriously about requiring it for the next game I run.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443058/#Comment_443058" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T09:45:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  9:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've usually been calling this CA as "Mechanical Johnny", from Mark Rosewater's psychographics.

How?  If anything, D&amp;D would be less engaging.<br/><br/>The point of the T/J/S analysis is that it's seeking to find specific game elements that will engage specific players.  A certain card will appeal to Timmy because it's big and impressive.  A different card will appeal to Spike because it's not particularly tricky or impressive, but it is efficient.<br/><br/>Using your four type model doesn't really help with any of that.  Can I point to a feat and say "this feat appeals to all players who play for the enjoyment of the game"?  No, because those players enjoy the game in a very different way.  Timmy might dislike a feat because it isn't visceral enough.  Change it to be more visceral, and Johnny might start to dislike it because it's too simplistic.  Change it to please Johnny, and Spike might dislike it because it's not an efficient choice.<br/><br/>And that extends equally into the other three realms you describe.  Consider three more psychographic profiles, corresponding to your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> (role-player) category:  Jenny,  Sam, and Erasmus.  They each derive their pleasure from the fictional, role-playing aspect of the game, but that doesn't really help the game designer.<br/><br/>For example, Jenny and Sam disagree on what the character advancement system should be like, because Jenny comes to the table with a specific character already in mind, and wants an advancement system that allows her to continue playing that character.  But Sam is all about change, and she wants a character advancement system that encourages drastic changes.  Jenny wants to start as a 1st level apprentice thief and end as a 20th level apprentice thief, while Sam wants to start as an apprentice thief and end as a king.  Meanwhile, Erasmus hates that, because Erasmus already knows the name of the king (Because Erasmus has read the setting guide cover-to-cover) and if someone else becomes king, that changes the world, and Erasmus is all about inhabiting the world he likes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Erasmus and Jenny disagree about the alignment system, because Erasmus believes that the alignment system helps define the important conflicts that shape the world, while Jenny believes that her character is a special snowflake and the alignment system is trying to force her to be in a box.  Meanwhile, Sam is fine with alignments, but only if she can change her character's alignment over the course of play.<br/><br/>To be an engaging game design in the way that MtG is an engaging game design, D&amp;D would have to recognize the difference between Jenny, Sam, and Erasmus.  Your 4-types model certainly fails to do that.  I think the actual designers of D&amp;D have often done a better job over the years, but they've done so in very haphazard ways, and some iterations of the game therefore fail to engage certain players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443212/#Comment_443212" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T21:33:21+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  9:33PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2015 9:33PM by Potemkin.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I think you're right. You really can't have convenient classifiable profiles relate to a game that's attempting as broad a number of things as D&amp;D is. I don't agree that it's trying to be all things to all people, but it's certainly used that way by some playgroups.<br/><br/>Whew, sorry for going off-topic a bit hard thar.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
