Two normal and one a "weird" psychic.<br/><br/>It started off okay, the players played out there normal routine for a bit and then got a call.<br/><br/>There was some weirdness on the scene so I had the players make a few one 1 die stress checks as they explored, the weird agent had 1 Cool from the start so could ignore them. One of the other agents got a 6 in the first couple of checks.<br/><br/>However the third player just couldn't get a break.<br/><br/>She rolled so low for the first few checks she was almost crippled before the real weirdness started.<br/><br/>Once things really kicked off other two had a couple of Cool points, so I could throw 4 and 5 point stress checks at them, and be reasonably confident that they wouldn't be completely ruined, however, the third player had no hope of handling that and quickly became dead weight.<br/><br/>This didn't ruin the game at all, everyone still had fun (even if they ended up failing the mission), but it was annoying.<br/><br/>Has anyone else had this problem? What do you do to deal with it, or avoid it altogether?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314185/#Comment_314185" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T07:15:45+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  7:15AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did the third player use dice off of the shared cards (library, gym, etc) to boost her rolls?

The usual response to this is to start minimizing Stress.  The GM starts calling for it less and less and starts calling for smaller and smaller rolls until Stress reduced to nothing but some color on top of the "wacky missions."<br/><br/>There's a whole other 50% of the game that's being missed here:  The inter-personal dynamics of running a start up company.  When someone is so stressed out that they have no dice that person should get MORE involved with the mission and generate all kinds of problems and trouble and yes MORE Stress for the rest of the team.  People should start framing confessionals and tagging people with all kinds of nasty traits.<br/><br/>The CEO/CFO should seriously start having to consider abandoning the mission.  Cut the losses, regroup, take some paid time off.  See if they can pull through on the next one.<br/><br/>Managing the interpersonal relationships and keeping the franchise afloat is precisely why InSpectres is actually a pretty mediocre "one-shot" even though tons and tons of people play that way because they get caught up in the "wacky missions."<br/><br/>GRR.<br/><br/>There's so much more to this game and so many people miss it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Helping dice are huge here too. The psychic can't earn Franchise dice (having a weird agent in a game with only three players is suboptimal...weird agents are actually detrimental to the company!).<br/><br/><i>This didn't ruin the game at all, everyone still had fun (even if they ended up failing the mission), but it was annoying.</i><br/><br/>Stress is good.

I hadn't had a chance to play it yet and I was a little nervous about the Stress issue due to some unlucky players I have.

At the beginning of every (new) InSpectres game I run, usually right after they make characters but before the mission starts, I pull out a specific chair into a prominent place and explain the confessional rules. Also, I'll prompt for confessionals during the game.<br/><br/>Good luck with your next game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314549/#Comment_314549" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T14:53:40+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  2:53PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you explain the Confessional rules to me?
