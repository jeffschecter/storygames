It occurs to me that I should probably introduce myself, since I've been away for a while. You might remember me as that dude who lays out stuff for Greg Stolze and John Wick. (Maybe not.)<br/><br/>I've played around with board game design and RPG design for a few years, but <a href="http://www.danielsolis.com/do/" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</a> is the first time I'm stepping into the commercial arena. The very kind folks at Evil Hat Games have taken me under their wing in this endeavor. It's a very large, very intimidating wing, but snuggly and comforting, like Coco the talking gorilla caring for her pet kitten.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, the premise of Do is that you're a group of young pilgrims sent out from a magical temple in the center of a vast, airy universe. During your pilgrimage, you travel to many different people who live on the little worlds that orbit the temple. (Think of the <i>Little Prince</i> set in the Elemental Plane of Air.) Each session focuses on one world and is framed around a letter that someone from that world has written to you, asking for your help. It's a little bit <i>Avatar: the Last Airbender</i>, a little bit <i>Dear Abbie</i>, and a little bit <i>Green Lantern Corps</i>.<br/><br/>Those letters were actually written by many big, giant names of gaming, like John Wick, Greg Stolze, Jared Sorensen, etc. Do's development has been very collaborative from the beginning, so I'm happy to finally announce that we're taking applications for beta testers. If you're interested, or know someone who is, check out the <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/do/application.html" rel="nofollow">application</a> and tell your friends. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
