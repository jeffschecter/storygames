Strategy/tactics was a big part of Planescape. A fun combat system like D&amp;D is a good idea for that game, because it lets you pit your tactica/strategic thinking against highly weird opponents with tons of strange powers.  You weren't going to argue those guys out of their position, they were entrenched in it literally with the force of nature itself.<br/><br/>And minis weren't really a huge part of D&amp;D when Planescape was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350844/#Comment_350844" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T17:35:58+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  5:35PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1149&amp;page=1#Item_46" rel="nofollow">The ole Planescape Awesome-O-Friend thread</a><br/><br/><a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2005/12/09/planescape-via-tsoy/" rel="nofollow">An old blog post about playing Planescape via TSOY</a><br/><br/>What I took away from Planescape is about changing reality through adventuring, changing the world in the Outer Realms with Sigil as the home base where adventurers have their city adventurers and tool up for the next excursion to whatever wack-ass planar destination is the next adventure-point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350849/#Comment_350849" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T17:59:21+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  5:59PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man I love me some Planescape! I have been thinking about this setting lately and have boiled it down to 2 core ideas for me: <br/><br/>Adventure Exploration - the game is all about traveling the multiverse and having adventures in cool weird places like a citadel built on the back of a god, a floating volcano island filled with vikings, a plane of metal cubes covered with evil humanoids locked in infinite war, and so on. Bust out some of those great maps that came in the box set and immediately I start daydreaming about the weird places. D&amp;D did a good job of handling this type of game. <br/><br/>Belief - then there is this whole other experience where beliefs and philosophy shape the multiverse and you have the conflict between Good vs Evil and Chaos vs Law. You have the Factions fighting for their philosophy, the Powers pushing their divine agenda, the Blood War fighting over what Evil will be and so on.  If you can get enough people to belief something you can change the planes and move them around, you can kill gods or bring them back. <br/><br/>I think it is actually hard to give equal weight to both concepts at the same time and even harder to pick a system that supports both, in the end I think you end up with one taking precedence over the other in the way D&amp;D focused in on exploration and used the philosophy as adventure color or excuse to explore something neat. <br/><br/>And since there actually needs to be a 3rd thing (Rule of 3 and all), Planescape is also all about the color! A lot of that color is D&amp;D inspired with the alignments, planar races and the Powers. But the rest is all of that glorious art. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350850/#Comment_350850" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T18:05:38+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  6:05PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doors. You had this super awesome urban setting that was connected to everywhere. Everywhere can be anything. You can do some genre-bending shit in the Planescape setting. I loved the weird-ass diaspora.<br/><br/>The Lady of Pain and the dabus being sort of the living embodiment of the city was also cool. You could do a lot with her and her motives and whatnot. They provided a distinct flavor to the setting.<br/><br/>I also love the Dustmen, and more broadly the political chaos in the setting. The Dustmen just happen to be my favorite faction.<br/><br/>I think D&amp;D is fine for Planescape. I think D&amp;D is also not a very helpful system, which is something we look for in modern games. It is very easy for D&amp;D to be an absolute shitstorm. It's also the case that D&amp;D is sort of the flagship RPG product, to use marketing-speak, and the impetus to conflate D&amp;D with roleplaying in general is huge. I think that causes a lot of bad feelings towards D&amp;D. I also think it's unrelated to the thread, but I wrote it, so there it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350863/#Comment_350863" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-07T20:44:39+00:00" title="December  7, 2011  8:44PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it was getting to play D&amp;D -- adventuring, looting, ass-kicking familiar ground -- in locations that went beyond strange into downright bizarre.

It wasn't like Mage where the universe twisted around an individual's paradigm, but rather that in order to exist and survive without going mad or being consumed by such a huge, insane, sprawling universe you had to try to make sense of it. And it was those beliefs that gave you power, not the other way around.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I think what grabbed me about Planescape are the same things as you, Thadrine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350925/#Comment_350925" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T11:39:15+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 11:39AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thadrine's idea of Planescape adventures are what I meant by "with Sigil as the home base where adventurers have their city adventurers "                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350929/#Comment_350929" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T12:33:15+00:00" title="December  8, 2011 12:33PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 12:33PM by thadrine.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feeling out of your league, and walking through places you know no mortal should was the biggest part.

Join a faction and your belief gives you an edge. Line yourself up with the belief of a plane and things go smoother for you. Belief wasn't some abstract faith thing anymore, it was the mechanics of reality that the planes ran on. Sure your individual belief may be a drop in the bucket, but it was concrete and worth dying or killing over. <br/><br/>Or at least that is always what I always wanted out of the setting.<br/><br/>I always wanted to run a game set entirely in one of the gatetowns that is about to be sucked out of the Outlands and into the plane it borders with the players all being residents working to keep the town or push it over the edge. Something about the large cosmic scale being focused neatly on your home really appeals and hits a lot of the belief oriented awesome I dig. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350962/#Comment_350962" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T19:03:39+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  7:03PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Planescape, as my favorite D&amp;D setting, helped solidify what I wanted out of a rpg. It was when, playing a LN Mercykiller charged with bodyguarding a queen on Arborea, the queen was poisoned, and I realized that my Mercykiller wouldn't care about finding the antidote, she'd care about bringing the assassin to justice. And if the queen died, then the assassin would have more to answer for. <br/><br/>My DM then suggested that I make a different character, since the party was going (being led) to find the antidote. <br/><br/>From then on, I wanted to play games where character/player choice mattered and was encouraged by the DM/play/system.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I just thought of a possible DitV hack, where instead of playing a single character, you play a faction. Relationship dice actually represent NPC agents of your faction. Fallout would be d4 (talking), d6 (magic?), d8 (fighting), and d10 (belief). The fictional space would be Sigil plus the Great Wheel. Conflicts would range from "do I gain political control over Sigil" to "I wage war on Acheron".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350963/#Comment_350963" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-08T19:09:49+00:00" title="December  8, 2011  7:09PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2011 7:10PM by Brian_Minter.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I spent a good amount of time this past year re-reading the original Planescape boxed set (and ran a few games using Storming the Wizard's Tower), so this topic is right in my wheelhouse lately.<br/><br/>Two things!<br/><br/>1. D&amp;D is a great game, but - to me - it's a bad fit for Planescape. Planescape is about exploring bizarre places, talking to demons and wizards and other super-powerful beings, intrigue (those super powerful beings have murky agendas) and chase scenes. Oh, and figuring stuff out. And maybe a little fighting. <br/><br/>But D&amp;D's rules are only really fun for fighting, and are either nonexistent or lame for all that other stuff.<br/><br/>2. The factions *seem* super cool, and made my high-school brain spin around.

My first brush has colored my perceptions of the setting. Even after I picked up the box set, the more philospher's with clubs approach has colored my opinion. I've never liked traditional D&amp;D beyond the dungeon crawl, and bushwacking elements. Anytime a game would expand beyond these, meh. For me, PLanescape is about an individual beliefs interacting with and changing a grander cosmology. Screw tactical considerations and game balance! That doesn't mean shit!<br/><br/>I would use HeroQuest/HeroWars as my basis. It'd allow enough tactics, and D&amp;D-isms which are inevitable, but who the character is has mechanical weight. Also I'd be able to handle Factions as communities and such (Factions are awesome!). It would allow for the more mythic, philosophical adventure without having to devolve into dungeon crawls in crazier places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351238/#Comment_351238" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-12T08:37:21+00:00" title="December 12, 2011  8:37AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot to mention: I've used Everway to run Planescape quite a few times, and liked the results.

So, I bought the original box set on ebay and  re-bought the computer game on GoG.com (on sale for five bucks till 1/2/12 and all the text in the game is roughly equivalent to the first 6 Harry Potter books).  I can't wait to read the box set.
