Manages to create a semblance of a narrative. I really like how your fears become positive resources when you confront them, and how choosing NOT to confront them flavors the narration of the game. I love that the character sheet is a clock, and really guides play one you grok its design.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I Kinda Liked: Gamey-game mechanics make planning your moves important. Taking risks is fun and carries real danger (you might get knocked out of the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nThings That Would Keep Me From Playing Again (this is long, but overall I have a positive view of the game):<br/>\n1. Creative disconnect lead to some hard shut-downs of player input (the Squid argument "The Squid is actually a cultist in a squid suit, right?" felt much more snippy at the table than it does in the Podcast). This was viewed as a problem by everyone at the table, and was discussed a lot in the post-game. So no, there are no tone reinforcement rules right now, but I would be surprised if there weren't any by the time the game was complete.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I literally had no interaction with about 60% of people at the table. Even in a large game of the Roach I'd have a scene or two with pretty much everyone, getting into their gaming brains. In this I pretty much only interacted with Rob and the guy playing Bob the Hobo. That meant I was disconnected and vaguely uninterested with around half the people at the table. Toward the end, as people got knocked out, this changed a bit for the people still playing, but still, I would like to see ways to force interaction across the table, as I felt like there were a couple different 'zones' of play that weren't interacting all that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Getting knocked out sucks. You lose half your game, and if you keep narrating for the person you were narrating for you TAKE half of the game from the person to your right (because they're no longer narrating for you). Narrative power is a super-important, super-limited resource in the game (for engagement, if nothing else), and it felt weird that Rob wasn't really narrating for Bob the Hobo even though we'd agreed to share those priveleges. I think this was because I was still in Bob the Hobo's physical proximity and I had been sharing his playspace in the game up to that point. This plays again into the isolation of players from each other, as well as the idea of tonal compatability. Until you're forced to, what the other players are doing simply doesn't effect you that much, due to the varied Fears and ideas people have about what's appropriate to the game as set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124706/#Comment_124706" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T05:47:30+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  5:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This probably isn't very helpful to you, but my feelings on the game are exactly the same as Remi's.

My perspective is shaped by the fact that my character was one of two 'Escapers'.  I liked it that players who were out were 'out'--there's a real incentive to stay alive if you want to keep playing.  I think that as players left the game, narration devolved to whomever remained.  I agree with Remi that there was little interaction with about half the other players until characters started dying, but there were some common locations that most of the characters wound up gravitating towards.  The Superdome was one, and the bridge to Mississippi was another--so there was a pseudo-interaction between characters as they arrived at the same location but were separated in time.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124714/#Comment_124714" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T06:40:25+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  6:40AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>Maybe instead of sequentially moving there could be some kind of effects that trigger a "jump X player seats, that player is the one framing your next scene". Even a simple d4 could do the trick, I guess.</blockquote>\nThere are a few problems with any sort of "skip a player/reverse the flow" elements:<br/><br/>- As a time-pressured game, there's value to only being obligated to keep tabs on what's going on for you and one other consistent character (the dude to your left).  I'd be worried about introducing too many moving parts; the game tries to ride on a knifes' edge of making you feel overwhelmed enough that your adrenal system kicks in, but not so overwhelmed that it becomes paralytic to taking action.<br/><br/>- The person who gets skipped, or the half of the table that gets ignored by a reversal of flow, could get really screwed -- not getting a turn for much longer, in which case the problems folks are trying to solve here are exacerbated for them: mutely sitting there accumulating doom tokens.<br/><br/>I'd also observe:<br/><br/>-  The time period of "sitting out" is meant to give you a chance to relax and just be the audience for a bit.  (I should note I've seen folks come along and simply watch an EoD! game from end to end and not actually sit down &amp; play.)<br/><br/>- Folks who escape do have an (optional rule) that lets them come back in and basically sacrifice themselves to give someone else a better chance of making it out alive.  (They come back in at 10 doom, but give one person +2 escape, or everyone +1 escape, something like that; done at the "right time", this could also add a minute to the clock, which might help someone.  This also might work better by putting them at 10 pain &amp; panic instead of 10 doom, which would simply make most kinds of failure deadly.)<br/><br/>- The above suggests that some sort of interesting "reincorporation" of folks who've died would be an interesting way to go.  I haven't figured out what to do there, though.<br/><br/>- The game doesn't run much longer than 2 hours in most configurations.  So the idea that dead means you're out has never struck me as *that* much of a problem.<br/><br/>That said!<br/><br/>Variants I'd be interested in trying would be to allow folks to increase their doom by one in order to change the flow of the game.  You could increase your doom by one to say:<br/><br/><b>"Skip!"</b> Instead of framing the scene for the guy to your left, you frame the scene for the guy to *his* left.<br/><br/><b>"Reverse!"</b> If the flow of play was clockwise, it's now counterclockwise; if counterclockwise, it's now clockwise.<br/><br/>The one problem with the above is that it's fairly abusable; two colluding players could really screw everyone else by doing a "low push, so I bleed off doom rapidly, but I spend doom to do a ping-pong Reverse! move with the other guy".   But assuming I can put workable "don't be a dick" guidelines into the game, and flag these as optional rules, great.  Alternately, I could also put in a "Denied!" clause that lets someone increase their doom to deny a Skip or Reversal move, which might be all the safety-valve this notion needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124716/#Comment_124716" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-06T06:48:05+00:00" title="February  6, 2008  6:48AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uhm... well, you could put a price on asshattery: maybe the player that increases his own doom to do a "Skip" or a "Reverse" also removes a Doom from the player that would have been the next?

Right now Escape or Die! is the game I'll bring to conventions -- zero prep, plays super-fast and gives you time to spend hanging out with folks &amp; talking.  (For this, I've come to realize that it's an excellent morning game -- since it wakes you up -- rather than an evening game.)  I haven't started writing the rules out in "long form" yet -- it's an amalgam of what's on the character sheet and what's in my head.  Most of the optional stuff's in my head, since the character sheet is too-crowded with text as it is.  I think the "production" version is going to have to move the rules summary elements off of the sheet and onto a third reference page.<br/><br/>I'm also working with <a href="http://gainsclockwork.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Russ "Contract Work" Collins</a> to replace the game's timer with a set of MP3's of appropriate length to the number of active players, so you can have the full "action movie soundtrack" experience and a genuine doom-chime noise.

One thing is that during the game, I'm uninvolved with most of the people at the table. It will be difficult for them to reincorporate my stuff if they aren't invested in it at all.<br/><br/>Ideas<br/>1. Each turn the remaining players MUST reincorporate at least one character or event related to each of the deceased characters. If not, the player whose stuff wasn't reincorporated has the option of spending X Escape to HALVE the time of the doom clock (so 30 seconds per player) for that round.<br/><br/>2. The deceased player may spend X Escape to pause the Doom Clock and request a 'Quiet Scene' for a number of players equal to X. This scene is a break in the action (it can be a flashback or happen in actual time, as long as it is plausible) and allows for some bonding between players. General Rule: Players sitting farthest from each other should be in these scenes.<br/><br/>3. If an element from a deceased player's play hasn't been reincorporated in the previous round, that Deceased player may spend 1 Escape to trigger a flashback scene between the deceased player and one other player. This should set up a new complication for that player, and occurs on the clock, after which play continues as normal.<br/><br/>Do any of these sound plausible, or do they break your conception of the game too much?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125367/#Comment_125367" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T07:08:38+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  7:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>1.

That said, I like some of the idea at work here -- dead players spending the Escape they built up to lighten the load -- but I want to make sure that it doesn't undercut the adrenaline element too much.  <br/><br/>Hm!  Maybe the dead person can spend up to X escape to rearrange the seating positions of up to X players, or something like that.  <br/><br/>Regardless, any "quiet scene" would have to have a time-limit on it to keep things true to my idea of the game; if a quiet scene was had, maybe it basically says "the quiet scene lasts until the doom clock chimes again; but when it does, doom does *not* advance."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>3.

And I do like the idea of dead players transitioning into (essentially) tormentors of some sort -- triggering "have another!" complications out of sequence for the still-living -- which could be juxtaposed with players who escaped being able to do things to aid the players.  It's more likely there would be dead/tormentor players early in the game, while escaped players only really show up after a minimum of six rounds of play (if they get lucky and get +2 escape on every roll), which might produce a nice "plot structure" to things.  <br/><br/>Just gotta figure out what that escape-power is... (more on that, below)  (But I think I'm clear that players who died would be spending their accumulated Escape by counting it back down to zero, while players who escaped would be spending their un-accumulated Doom, counting it up to 12, and maybe being able to re-enter play -- reset to zero escape -- one their Doom is at a given point, or something.)<br/><br/>Add into this the whole "skip/reverse" thing talked about above and this would have more craziness and more mix-and-match interaction with the other players.  Perhaps enough added complexity to call these the "advanced rules", with the version folks played at Dreamation being the basics.  (I suggest this because I have seen a few players here and there who have regarded the existing basics as the maximum number of moving parts they want -- so any "advanced" stuff should be all about putting new powers in escaped/dead players' hands, without the still active players having to carry the burden beyond reacting to it.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>What if someone who was dead could give away a portion of their Escape as a resource for people what pleased them?</blockquote>\nI like the fanmail roots that come from this, but I worry that this could undercut the drama a bit too directly; if someone who's dead after they got 10 points of escape they could potentially just fiat the escape of everyone else at the table and really just sort of kill the fun-tension.  So anything along these lines would have to operate on a kind of exchange-rate, where +1 escape for someone else comes at a steep price.<br/><br/>Good directions here, though.  I'm starting to feel my way to rules that would (hopefully) make Remi even happier at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125373/#Comment_125373" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T07:34:27+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  7:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I wasn't thinking a 1:1 ratio for dead-Escape to other-guy's-Escape, or even Escape-to-Escape.

Gotta escape or die!<br/><br/>I was thinking along the same lines as Robert. What if every time the GM had to adjust the clock, two players switched places. The clock is effectively stopped at this point and if only a small number of players are moving it shouldn't take long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
