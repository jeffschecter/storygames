Some of my players of past campaigns did start LiveJournals in their characters' names and wrote a few posts in their fictional voices. That was cool..</blockquote>\n<br/>I have had unbelievable success with many of my bluebooks for my last campaign (using 3.5).  We're on hiatus for now and I'm starting another campaign with 4e this weekend but feel free to take a look at my bluebook entries.  The funny thing is we play WEEKLY and I still had excitement/interest to do an average of 3-4 a week!<br/>We did it by way of wiki posting, keeping it private between only those players in the bluebook conversation.  It's all using the Midnight campaign setting, so paranoia is rampant. <br/><a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Midnight:_the_SHADOW_KILLERS_Campaign_SPOILER_PAGE#Book_I.2C_WIKI_BLUEBOOKING" rel="nofollow">Bluebooks from my Midnight Campaign</a><br/><br/>They may be confusing to some because many are taken from the context of the previous week's session...<br/><br/><br/>I also have a "<a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Bluebooking" rel="nofollow">Bluebook Wiki Format</a>" for doing Bluebook by wiki here:  <br/><br/><br/>thoughts anyone?<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe" title="Maddrjeffe"><img alt="Maddrjeffe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maddrjeffe">Maddrjeffe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149859/#Comment_149859" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T17:37:12+00:00" title="June 11, 2008  5:37PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow first things first, awesome example of bluebooking. <br/>\nbluebooking is tough, because some people just aren't up to that kind of writing and it gets tougher as your life commitments become more pronounced (babies, wives etc).<br/>\nCastle Falkenstein has some awesome ideas for bluebooking, or journaling. Paste in pictures, tickets... snippets of conversation, telegrams and letters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only danger is playing before you play...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey" title="VacuumJockey"><img alt="VacuumJockey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VacuumJockey">VacuumJockey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151164/#Comment_151164" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T07:20:49+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  7:20AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just started a West Marches-style campaign, and we use a Google Group as an information repository.

Some players and/or GMs are willing to engage in it via forum posts or e-mail exchanges, but there's an understanding that it's for their own fun only: there's no mechanical reward for doing it, they try to steer clear of doing anything especially significant through it, and any significant events which do arise from bluebooking-type extracurriculars must be summarized and relayed to the non-bluebooking players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151177/#Comment_151177" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T09:06:59+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  9:06AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/sis.html" rel="nofollow">Sign in Stranger</a>, the characters are human colonists inhabiting an alien world. At the end of each session, you write a few lines in character in your "personal log".  Then you start off the next session by reading off everyone's latest entries.  To help make the writing relevant to the game play, you can get card for incorporating something somebody wrote into an investigation or conflict. And also you get some insight into what the characters are thinking about one another.  The Durham Three, when they played, got a lot of mileage out of this kind of bluebooking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
