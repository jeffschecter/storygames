This film will be about 5 minutes long and will end up on YouTube most likely. While I\u2019m working on this project, I would like to get enough footage to support a longer film after my class is done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy aim here is to talk about story games in a positive light to as broad an audience as possible. While I can\u2019t make any promises about how much (if any) promotion my final film gets, I am passionate about the hobby and want to get the word out.<br/>\nWhat I need is some volunteers to be interviewed on video. I\u2019m looking for a diverse cross-section of the hobby, along as many axes as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere\u2019s the bummer part: I need to do these interviews very quickly: in the next couple of weeks. I am also geographically limited: I live in the Seattle area, and can range around western Washington to some degree. The good news is that my schedule is pretty open, so I can most likely work with whatever time constraints participants have.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to help out and live in (or will be visiting) the Seattle area, please drop me message. The commitment I need from each person is realistically a couple of hours, with somewhere between 20 minutes to an hour of actual filmed interviewing.<br/>\nAgain, sorry to spam the board when I haven\u2019t been an active poster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to hear from some of you, and I look forward to spreading the word about story games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJay                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346270/#Comment_346270" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-17T00:01:39+00:00" title="October 17, 2011 12:01AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what you do is find John Harper and you buy him all the beer.<br/><br/>And then you film it.<br/><br/>More seriously, [man, they should teach you qualitative research sampling strategies at film school; I know, I know, science is harrrrrddddd] you do this:<br/><br/>Email the organizers of Go Play North West and of that other Con that seemed rad uhm ... Fabricated Realities! Like Right the Hell Now. Woo them with beer and promises of fame. They then can send out a mass email to previous attendees, if they're cool with that, pitching your project and asking for participation. <br/><br/>Then you hope the participants come to you.<br/><br/>Which they will because you can promise them something I can't promise without violating the Tri-Council Policy Statement Guidelines for Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans: beer and/or marijuana cigarettes. Also, that anything might come of your research.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346285/#Comment_346285" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-17T08:14:21+00:00" title="October 17, 2011  8:14AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2011 8:15AM by cy.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go to <a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.storygamesseattle.com/</a><br/>Thursday, 6:30 Gamma World Games<br/><br/>Talk to Ben.
