The levels (sessions) in the first stage should <em>feel</em> different than levels in the last stage.<br/><br/>There are little nearly-rules like "nobody dies in the first stage" but I can't seem to articulate enough of these or enough powerful versions of these to really flavor the different stages appropriately.  I thought about having a little short paragraph that is read at the beginning of each level, with different stages having different readings, kind of like Radio Lightning in Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>Then I thought: what if, at the very top of the game, to open the Grandmasters at the Lodge of the Americas phase, everybody around the table performs the 'secret handclasp' of the Sons of Liberty and gives passwords and counterpasswords to each other, flavored appropriately?<br/><br/>So you start off the Intolerable Acts levels by clasping hands with the guy to your right, saying, "If we do not hang together," to which he responds, "we shall surely hang separately."  Then you go right into creating objectives.<br/>Then, at the end of the campaign, you start off the Fires of Adversity levels by clasping hands and saying, "The States do not have to win," to get the response, "The Empire just has to lose."  And bam, objectives.<br/><br/>Here's the question(s): first, is this hokey, or would it lend a certain air to the 'secret meeting of the grand masters'?  Then, secondly, would starting off in this way color the objectives (which you create literally moments later), and thereby color the whole session where you pursue those objectives?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80723/#Comment_80723" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T16:18:19+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  4:18PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it sounds fun- although re-read the integral/optional thread for skepticism on ritual stuff<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, since our group tends to skip ritual openings suggested by games, does the masonic hand shake/exchange appeal to you as designer/player?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thought- I like the entering the room procedures from the committee for the exploration of mysteries - maybe something like that where players get to make up or read off cool rumors about the other characters                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80734/#Comment_80734" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T17:00:48+00:00" title="July 11, 2007  5:00PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not so much after a ritualized opening as I am after some mechanic or procedure that will lend a different vibe to different levels <em>without</em> making massive changes to the basic mechanics.

But hokey can be fun. It can also be powerful. Little rituals like this can be very useful if all the players buy-in.<br/><br/>When I got my MBA the program began with a three day retreat. There were lots of little games and puzzles that we were told would teach us something profound about ourselves and how we communicate. And they did, precisely because the moderators said they would and got us to believe them. The first game involved putting puzzles together as a group where everybody had everyone else's pieces. You weren't allowed to speak or otherwise request help. You were only allowed to silently help others. It made a simple puzzle mind-blowingly difficult and required a mind shift to effectively communicate. That one puzzle game framed the rest of the weekend.<br/><br/>When they work, rituals act on the subconscious parts of the brain. Lots of magical rituals begin with something to phsychologically engage the participants in the results of the ritual about to be performed. Often this is some form or payment for the services of the spiritualist. Other things like candle lighting, ritual washing, repeating key phrases, act to seperate the ritual from everyday life. To make the ritual special.<br/><br/>If you want the players to think like they are in a "Secret Meeting of the Grand Masters," then by all means make them start off with behaving like they are a bunch of Grand Masters at a Secret Meeting. <br/><br/>Of course, rituals only work if everyone believes they will. But, people who don't believe in them will just throw them out anyway. So, my rec would be to push for the game you want and include them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80782/#Comment_80782" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T00:43:23+00:00" title="July 12, 2007 12:43AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>Based exclusively on my Polaris experience, I would say that this has the potential to be quite useful and powerful, and I do think that it would tend to color the objectives that you create.</blockquote>\nThe difference between something like this &amp; Polaris is that Polaris is mechanically all about ritual, so that's constantly reinforced.  I see something like this as a minor use that isn't reinforced often enough to stick with the "I'm not sure about this silly ritual phrase thing" crowd.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I'm fighting that right now with my group about my game.  There's a signal that's suppose to happen at every scene when one player goes from narrating the new scene to signaling to everyone else that it's okay to start playing now.  Everyone forgets that and just gestures, in spite of the side effect the the ritual phrase is suppose to have: reminding everyone what's in the forefront of the central player's mind.  So, even with the mechanical effect that's explained and understood, it can be a hard sell.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Here's the question(s): first, is this hokey, or would it lend a certain air to the 'secret meeting of the grand masters'?

But hokey doesn't sound <i>bad</i> when it comes to Sons of Liberty, at least from what I've heard &amp; read about it.  I might suggest that you encourage your group to come up with their own phrases for this, to take up more ownership.  That could drive play in the direction they want -- whether hokey or conspiratorial -- and might give more ownership to encourage ritual phrase use.  (That latter part is part my my attempt with my game's ritual phrase, as one player says "That's with you said/thought..." and another answers with the single driving impulse written on their character sheet -- like, "I must stop the ritual!"  So far, I'm not sure of this particular custom ritual phrase idea is a success, but I'm not sure if its a failure either.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80785/#Comment_80785" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T02:56:32+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  2:56AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How ritualistic is the rest of the game? I worry about patches of ritual in games that aren't, on the whole, ritualistic. <br/><br/>(This, pretty much, is my gripe with the salute in Beast Hunters: it's the only bit of ritual in the game, so it feels a bit out of place. To me. In my personal opinion).<br/><br/>There's a bit of a fad for rituals in indie games at the moment. You see odd patches of rituals appearing in, say, Game Chef games, but they're not worked into the game as a whole. For example, in Troy Costisick's game "Hunter Rose", there's a sudden moment of ritual where you toss rose petals in the air and whisper "Death!". And you think: that's a weird bit, where did that come from?<br/><br/>That said, I like the <i>idea</i>, especially the phrases.

This is opening the scene where you play the Secret Grandmasters of the Sons of Liberty, and you're greeting each other as you arrive at the secret meeting location.  Handclasp, sign, countersign: now we can begin.  Change anything for your sensibilities?<br/><br/>John suggested whispering.  That might be useful for the first stage, but I think it would be counterproductive for the others.  Perhaps I can think of things to flavor the other two stages in similar ways.  Thinking.  (For reference, the stages are: The Intolerable Acts, where the Sons are engineering the revolution; the Shot Heard Round the World, where the Sons are rallying colonists to the cause; and the Fires of Adversity, where the Sons have to keep the revolution going just... one... more... day!)<br/><br/>Graham, me personally, I don't really see this as a ritualized opening, any more than the GM saying, "So you all meet in a tavern..."  This takes place <em>already inside the game</em>, rather than as the transition from non-game into game-space.  And the game, where you're playing pseudo-masons, has a goodly portion of ritual to it.  So to me, this 'fits' but it fits inside the game, rather than necessarily fitting with the zany mad-libs-and-rummy game mechanics.  Dunno, however, if the two would still clash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80880/#Comment_80880" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T10:54:17+00:00" title="July 12, 2007 10:54AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it does make a difference it's in character.<br/><br/>I think you should put it in, see how it works, but be absolutely ruthless about taking it out if it's not doing anything.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81024/#Comment_81024" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T19:33:17+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  7:33PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Thanks for all the comments, guys.<br/><br/>For the "This is maybe sort of hokey, and I might not like it" folks: does it make any difference that the "ritual" is performed in-character, rather than out-of-character?
