One thing I don't know - on your turn, is everyone supposed to stand back and give you free reign unless you invite them to participate, or are they supposed to go crazy and interrupt and build on your stuff and invite their own characters and npcs into the scene, knowing that if they overstep you can just 'try a different way' on them?<br/><br/><br/>And I have statements!<br/><br/>Your game sounds really cool!<br/><br/>That's really neat, making 'The Mystery' an element you can own. It gives you a sort of GM authority to advance plot - more so than if, say, simply 'Magic' or 'Science' is an element. (One could use one's ownership of Magic to advance the plot, but I've never seen anyone think to do that.) I will have to remember that technique next time I play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376417/#Comment_376417" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T12:49:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2012 12:49PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great questions!<br/><br/>The game's got a core structure, which we follow (this person's in charge of that aspect, like Jason's in charge of the Mystery, and I own the Organization/Personnel), and we also rely on Resolution to deal with conflict. And, of course, we invoked Fate a couple of times last night. But I completely forgot about all the phrases that you can invoke along the way (I want an interlude, let's do that part over, et cetera).<br/><br/>So I've left out a bunch of stuff while playing, and I even forgot about Fate (though the other two players, having played the game before, knew what they were doing and drew Fate cards when appropriate).<br/><br/>Now, as far as turns go, I don't know what the rules say. But the way we were doing it, one person would sort of set the tone, establish the characters present, and then we'd all pretty much dive in and add stuff as necessary. It all seemed to fit perfectly, so there wasn't any 'try a different way' needed. As you put it, we would go crazy and build on each other's stuff. And it was gonzo. But it worked out great.<br/><br/>As for your statements -- yeah, the game really is going pretty well! Mainly, this is because Jason and Joel can rock the hard-scifi technobabble. When it's my turn to talk about what's wrong with the ship, it usually comes out something like, "Captain, the helium tank is empty, and the CO2 cartridge is out of toner! We're going to crash!" Which is why I'm playing a soldier who doesn't know anything about space stuff.<br/><br/>Jason's ownership of the Mystery is great, because people keep throwing ideas out, and some of them just get folded into the mix like chocolate chips into cookie dough. Others are picked out and discarded like egg shells in cookie dough. But since Joel's in charge of the robots, which keep killing people (or dismembering their corpses, if they're already dead), he gets to have all kinds of fun too. And I own the organization/people, so I can screw around with NPCs and unpleasant histories between characters -- everybody has something awesome to monkey with. But Jason's is the best because it's scary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376427/#Comment_376427" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T13:28:38+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  1:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2012 6:01AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Without the key phrases you've still got element ownership, destinies, fates, and conflict resolution, which are the pieces that are getting a lot of use. We rotate scene authority around the table in a very traditional turn-taking way. <br/><br/>What's interesting to me is the grey area between owned elements. I felt perfectly comfortable saying the hole in Turner's faceplate was the exact dimensions of our irradiated hull-robot Veero's limbs, even though I don't own the tech, because the robots turning bad is part of the mystery and I needed to make it clear that they had ganked Turner.<br/><br/>Similarly, a lot of the weird stuff with the Lieutenant and his wife bleeds (heh) into The Mystery, but Rafael's comfortable authoring it because of his own authority over People and the Mission. <br/><br/>Basically I've never seen owned elements get relied on or used so much. It may be related tot he fact that we're not using the key phrases as aggressively as we're supposed to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376428/#Comment_376428" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T13:30:48+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  1:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>Maybe I misunderstand Archipelago, though.

I mean, you've got a demented robot gutting a corpse, just after a huge argument about leadership and danger. That covers Joel's stuff (robots), yours (mystery), and mine (personnel). So there's huge overlap between our elements, which means that we keep tweaking our particular aspects of each scene.<br/><br/>Really, the elements are such a great idea, and such a great way to keep each player pushing the context forward, as well as individual character decisions. You know what, though? If I play this game again, I'm going to create a big map (11"x17") and use minis to keep track of where people are. That would be badass. Not sure if it would actually add anything to play, but it would look really cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376514/#Comment_376514" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-04T18:48:42+00:00" title="May  4, 2012  6:48PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maps, that's another Archipelago thing.

Everybody on Europa died, creepily represented by the last surviving human holding down the F key on a keyboard as his or her life ended, crying out to the void. The surviving humans landed on Earth as planned, to find themselves in what amounted to a zoo where Guyana used to be, their future unknown and unknowable. One guy, the engineer Beausoliel, stayed in orbit with 60 days of consumables and no hope of anything at the end of it. And as icing on the failcake, they had tipped their hand concerning where they had come from.<br/><br/>One nice thing about this mini-campaign was that it was a little incoherent - we never knew exactly what the machine intelligence wanted, we never understood its motivations, it was genuinely frightening. Some people it killed horribly, some people it co-opted, a few it seemed to avoid. That, layered on the weird atmospheric stuff about ghosts (combined with ghosts in the machine) gave the whole game a menacing air of unpredictability and terror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377773/#Comment_377773" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T08:34:57+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  8:34AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am still reading the rules, so maybe Jason can answer this one for me, but what we wound up doing was, whenever two people disagree, the third gets to interpret the Resolution. So I say to Jason's character, this is how it's going to be, and then he says, it's not going to be that easy -- and then it's Joel who gets to interpret the Resolution. So Joel reads it to us, and explains how the "yes, but" is going to be implemented in this particular case. So everybody is a part of the conflict -- the player who wants something to happen, the one who opposes this, and the one who resolves it. For a three-player game, it's perfect! And everybody had a chance to resolve stuff. It's really fun.<br/><br/>We used the map a lot this time -- when a bunch of people in cryostasis were killed, Joel crossed out half of that section of the map to indicate damage to that part of the ship. When part of the ship detached, to land on the Earth, Joel drew a line to indicate which half remained in orbit, and which half detached to land on the planet.<br/><br/>Exhilarating stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
