I want ripples to be felt through the campaign, to radically change the character both story-wise and mechanically. The wolf for instance, while retaining his memories and personality, now had to deal with being a wolf: can he still cast his spells, even though they have Somatic and Verbal components? Can he use scrolls? How does he talk to his party members? How are they going to try to cure his wolf-ism? How do his friends and family react to his new state? All wonderful drama to play off of.<br/><br/>So what sorts of alternative death rules can y'all recommend that are interesting? The first thing I thought of was <i>FATE Core</i>, which has the <b>Extreme Consequence</b> option: You replace one of your Aspects with whatever terrible thing happened to you instead of dying. Interesting enough, but it lacks the "Ooomph" that I wanted.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421369/#Comment_421369" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T09:26:59+00:00" title="September 11, 2013  9:26AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Easy resurrection</b><br/>For my Opal Empires setting for 13th Age, I'm making resurrection easy. The plane is locked so spirits are stuck on earth. As a result, it's easy to bring people back. If you don't have the original body, or if it's not in working order, get a different body. Stick the spirit back in it. Voila! Alive again!<br/><br/><b>Make dying less likely</b><br/>In 13th Age, there's an option suggested that you can't actually be killed by an unnamed NPC -- that is, one of the important villains. If you're fighting nameless minions or mooks, the worst they can do is capture you and take you to a named villain. Sure, the villain might kill you, but there are plenty of opportunities for escape or bargaining before that happens.<br/><br/><b>Just don't die</b><br/>You don't need FATE to have extreme consequences. Just rule that instead of dying, you can accept some other nasty consequence.  Or if the PCs are supposed to be Big Damned Heroes, just ask them how they narrowly avoid death. If it's not dramatic enough, tell them to try again.<br/><br/><b>Dead, but their legacy lives on</b><br/>Whenever a PC dies, advance the timeline 15-20 years. Play the children or students of the current PCs. Yeah, even if you lived, you have to make a new character. Keep your friends alive and that won't happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421378/#Comment_421378" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T10:54:21+00:00" title="September 11, 2013 10:54AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2013 10:54AM by WarriorMonk.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've integrated these post-mortem mechanics to my current hack:<br/><br/><b>Haunt</b><br/>Your spirit remains attached to one of their mortal posessions until they accomplish their mission. Your friends can hear your voice, perception stats/mechanics remain the same, spell-like abilities still work at most, and you can even do some poltergeist with the object you're possesing, though you can't make it travel (somebody has to carry the object with them)<br/><br/><b>Retirement</b><br/>Instead of dying your character becomes crippled and retires from adventuring. Player creates a new character but can inherit the equipment, learn skill from the retired one and the character gets to become a major npc that the PCs can go to for counsel, information and other resources.<br/><br/><b>Legacy</b><br/>Character dies but leaves a legacy to the next player's character <i>inmediatly</i>. When the character receives the final blow, their death scene is delayed until the player makes a new character. Then on their first scene, the character arrives to witness the death scene of the previous one and hear their last words. Then the new character picks up their objective of the deceased one along with their most powerful items if you want, and start from there. You can leave the player to frame the whole sequence by themselves if they want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421379/#Comment_421379" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-11T10:55:57+00:00" title="September 11, 2013 10:55AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have this nagging idea for a multiplanar setting, where each plane is an afterlife for another plane, and the graph is both complex and potentially cyclic.
