During the course of the unfolding, Lovecraftian story, the PCs discovered a plantation where the white owners had all been slain <i>and the slaves were all still alive.</i>  Given that we weren't playing a bunch of monster-hunters, and given further that we were all whites of the period (I was a military officer), it doesn't take much to see where we went from there: clearly the slaves killed the masters and were telling lies about the event.<br/><br/>The only problem we had was that the group seemed very, very invested in this idea of being contemporarily progressive in race terms, even if this made <i>no</i> sense from a story/character standpoint.  Maybe there was some meta-thinking involved -- most GMs don't do slave-revolt scenarios, after all -- and therefore the initial premise was glossed over, I don't know, as I never played with these people again (convention game).<br/><br/>At any rate, I tried to make my portrayal as honest as possible, moving through the scenario and its revelations as the <i>character</i> would, not as Guy-Who's-Read-A-Lot-Of-Lovecraft would.  And during the course of my character's coming around to the weird goings-on, he uttered the unspeakable.  No, I didn't say the name of Hastur.  I said... <i>nigger</i>.<br/><br/>Man, you could have heard a pin drop after that.  I had five people staring at me like I had three heads for the rest of the game, all because I wanted to address the setting and the character in a genuine fashion.  After a couple more uncomfortable hours, the story was complete and I was on my way, thinking mostly: "What the hell just happened there?  Who sets a game in pre-Civil War Virginia with <i>that</i> kind of thing happening, a handful of white characters and acts shocked when bigotry enters the picture?"<br/><br/>Maybe people aren't used to letting the ugly out when they play.  Maybe there's a comfortable distance between reality and gaming that has to exist in order for the average gamer (whatever that means) to remain comfortable.  Maybe some players can't separate character from the person across the table.  I have ideas, obviously, but I'd like to hear yours.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111142/#Comment_111142" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T13:05:27+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  1:05PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2007 1:07PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your maybes don't really matter, and are a bit insulting. It wasn't their fault. The problem is you crossed a line that sounds like it was in place for everyone else at the table, and you were out of sync. The solution is, before play, to start a discussion about where people's lines are, and it's also good for the GM to point out and make clear, that they will involve slaves which will bring up issues of race (and human rights, and sexual abuse, and torture, etc).  Maybe everyone was fine with having bigotry enter the picture, but not with the N-word. Unless you have a talk, you won't know where the line is until you cross it.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's poor form to make any sort of defense of crossing someone's line by saying "Well, it's what my character would do."  The correct response is more like "Shit, I'm sorry, I was trying to be true to the period, I didn't stop to think that it would cause a problem. We obviously need to establish some boundries that's going to make sure everyone is comfortable, because I was working with different assumptions." That way, if you're interested in playing a bigot, or even just raising racial issues, or issues of any sort that's likely to push buttons, you'll know ahead of time.  Some people have no problem roleplaying violence against people, but can't stand violence against animals. You can't know for sure where the lines are until you establish them out in the open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111144/#Comment_111144" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-02T13:11:48+00:00" title="December  2, 2007  1:11PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam I Am</cite>(convention game)</blockquote>\nI think that's probably a lot of it right there.

Like it or not, progressive minds of the 19th century weren't completely sold on the idea of blacks as human beings of equivalent stature to whites.  Even Abraham Lincoln wanted to repatriate blacks to Africa rather than have them around.<br/><br/>I was reminded of this game while suffering recently through the first few chapters of the absolutely godawful novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805440321/thehawfam-20" rel="nofollow">The Justice Riders</a>, in which whites and blacks get along <i>just so darned well</i> during the Civil War.  Heck, even Ezra Justice's slave buddy doesn't hold that whole you-used-to-own-me thing against him!  I'm a writer and an historian, so any attempt to turn this period of American history into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_South" rel="nofollow">Song of the South</a> rubs me the wrong way.\n<blockquote>The idea of playing themes of bigotry aside, you used an ugly word that makes people uncomfortable.

I'm also a little attached to the idea of adults being responsible for themselves.  I didn't make excuses or apologies for my use of the word in an historically accurate context because this was the setting, this is what's happening and here's the kind of thing that'd be said.  I failed to understand then and now why one would be scandalized.<br/><br/>If I'd come in with a Stars 'n' Bars belt buckle and talked <i>clearly out of character</i> in an explicitly bigoted fashion, I could see why someone could (and should) be discomfited or even offended.  As Ron mentioned, there's no way for people to know for certain without asking, but then again, there's no law against <i>actually asking</i>, is there?\n<blockquote>If was a man of his time and a misogynist to boot, would you have said the word cunt?

There probably was 3 sentences of notes involving clues or magical artifacts they'd give the heroes.  Which isn't surprising, after all, Lovecraft's stories repeatedly show people of color as being more knowledgeable or better equipped supernaturally to deal with Unspeakable Doom, yet lacking intelligence or spine to actually deal with it, instead handing it all off the the white hero for salvation (or, at least some comprehension of doom as it kicks in). <br/><br/>Even still, the thing to consider is that you brought up the issue that would involve having to consider them as people and not extras...  Think of it this way- what if you were watching Indiana Jones and expecting glossed over Nazis, fun action Nazis, and you got Schindler's List instead?  You'd probably be shocked, and even upset.   For them, they wanted to deal with Lovecraftian monsters in the Bayou, not think about the history of oppression and genocide. <br/><br/>Overall, it sounds like everyone dropped the ball on this, but the important part to consider is yours, since you're the only person you can affect.   The game was imaginary, but the people at the table were real.  The issue of racism is real.   Next time you encounter a triggering topic or issue, how do you want to deal with the people you play with?

Think of it this way- what if you were watching Indiana Jones and expecting glossed over Nazis, fun action Nazis, and you got Schindler's List instead?  You'd probably be shocked, and even upset.   For them, they wanted to deal with Lovecraftian monsters in the Bayou, not think about the history of oppression and genocide.<br/><br/>Overall, it sounds like everyone dropped the ball on this, but the important part to consider is yours, since you're the only person you can affect.   The game was imaginary, but the people at the table were real.  The issue of racism is real.

Basically, what might be an appropriate reaction from the viewpoint of historical accuracy or character consistency might still not be one from the view point of the people around the table and the type of game they want to play.<br/><br/>To take a somewhat stupid example: Historically, medieval warfare (Or war in general, whatever.) was ripe with rape and other ugliness, but people might still be interested in some aspects of the period, like the political situation or even just the "color" of the time, without necessarily being ok with others, like characters raping NPCs or even just the GM describing this happening.<br/><br/>Something similar seems to have happened here, with the GM/players being more interested in the "color" or style of the period then actually adressing matters like racism in a significant manner. And that's ok and easily resolved if you don't assume that just because it's a game set in a specific period, historical accuracy will matter or be appropriate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111267/#Comment_111267" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T07:03:53+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  7:03AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes historical gaming is Real History (tm), and sometimes it's RenFaire History (occasionally, it's Disney Presents: Happy Fun History or History: Why My Politics Are RIGHT).

But to just say that a game is centered on the Antebellum South and leave it at that, I probably would have made the same assumptions Sam did.

Just to make sure that everyone was on the same page.<br/><br/>If I was not the GM and just a player in the game, sitting in the seat you were, with what I know now, when I was thinking of what was going on, I probably would have said, "Hold up guys, I need to run something by you all. So, this is a real gritty historical game running in a background of a slave revolt, and we're all playing privileged white people. ... Is anyone here planning on using the N-bomb?" (and for me myself, personally, I'd add, "...because I'm not, and I'm thinking we can get around it by saying "Black Man", "Black People" etc. And I want to make sure we don't get uncomfortable, so if anyone feels weird just jump out of character and say so...").<br/><br/>Again, hindsight 20/20 and all that.

I also enjoy Lovecraft, just as Sam does.<br/><br/>If that game were to take place in my group, and it very well could as it sounds riveting and relevant to our gaming interests, it would likely have sounded like a rap song. Since we're not politicians, there's no need to be politically correct; and if calling an African American Gentleman of Progress and Persuasion a <i>nigger</i> in a shared imagined space over the course of weaving a story makes people that touchy, it sounds more like they have personal issues with exploitation and image, i.e. they're too wound up in themselves to realize that they're not in a real life situation, calling a real life person a nigger.<br/><br/>I'm Portuguese. I've been called a Pogue before. Most people in American society don't even know that racial slurs for smaller European communities exist anymore. I work and game with several black folks, and I've gamed with one who's played a white racist, both to comic effect and to explore the roles of slavery in the Antebellum South. People in our world take themselves tragically too silly. I fear that if many post-modern liberal gentiles heard our group of multi-ethnic, spiritually diverse, pansexual, well educated erudites walk into a restaurant and say "How y'all nigras doin'?" they wouldn't have the sense to laugh at the absurdity.<br/><br/>P.S.

Your group isn't every group.  I don't know about you, but your friend group sounds like mine. But playing with a new group (like at a con) should be like any meeting of strangers. New social boundries have to be figured out. Most people roleplay as pure escapism, not to explore the underbelly of humanity.  This is probably five times as true at a con (or 100 times as true at a con than compared to this board). So that should be your base assumption.<br/><br/>It was poor form of the con GM not to establish boundries as well, but that doesn't excuse behavior for saying something you wouldn't say to a random stranger on the street.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111447/#Comment_111447" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T17:06:54+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  5:06PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2007 5:09PM by Southpaw.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>It was poor form of the con GM not to establish boundries as well, but that doesn't excuse behavior for saying something you wouldn't say to a random stranger on the street.</blockquote>\nThat's where you and I part ways on this subject.

Sure it can make people think or make them pissed off, but is it the most effective way to be authentic or explore themes of racism?<br/><br/>The word once came up in a Mountain Witch game set in 1910 Europe. And it was directed at my character, said by the GM in character as an NPC. It pushed my character's buttons, and mine. The incident created a good conflict, and my character got to throw hot coffee in the NPC's face. I wouldn't want it to happen again, though. There were other ways we could have created a conflict and my character might have thrown coffee in an NPC's face.  <br/><br/>Then again, if we had talked about the boundaries beforehand, I wonder if it would have come up. As much as I hate the word, I think of it as one of those things you just don't do in mixed (race) company. Don't say nigger when there's a black person in the room. Assume that person dislikes the word. And I would assume that my friends don't typically use it, which is also why I wouldn't have thought to say, "let's avoid saying racial epithets."<br/><br/>Granted I'm just one [black] person who happens to dislike the word. I know some people embrace it, let it fly freely for anyone to hear. And that's the problem with using any racial commonly known epithet as a way to explore racism, especially one which is still prevalent in our language.

Whether you'd care to repeat the experience is immaterial; I've seen plenty of films and read plenty of books that dealt with difficult issues well, but were so unpleasant that I wouldn't care to watch/read them again.

That means that there exists a responsibility to identify <i>when</i> those hard-to-handle issues should be dealt with head on and when they should be soft-pedaled. In this instance, the person upon whom that responsibility rested, the GM, dropped the ball.<br/><br/>But when the person who's supposed to be responsible drops the ball, <i>it's someone else's responsibility to pick it up</i> before it becomes a tripping hazard. I've found that, as a general operating principle, anytime you're in a situation where "someone" should be responsible for something, it's best to just assume that "someone" is you. <br/><br/>I hope you can chalk this up as a learning experience. Next time you're in a game where no one's talking about the thing that needs to be talked about, <i>be the one to bring it up.</i> You've already seen what happens when you don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111806/#Comment_111806" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T23:02:37+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 11:02PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite><br/><br/>If that game were to take place in my group, and it very well could as it sounds riveting and relevant to our gaming interests, it would likely have sounded like a rap song.

The slur-using player and the other participants were not in fact transported to the same "space," even within the bounds of functional metaphor. In fact, the metaphor is now damaging the discussion, because both the OP and Jarrod, above are appealing to the authority wielded by the supposed space. One says the SIS's fictive history has standing. The other says that there's something psychologically *wrong* with the person if they get offended by the SIS.<br/><br/>These are not shared spaces. They are individual spaces in individual narratives, and on a larger level, these stories about unpleasant conflicts at the table are about assuming one's own narrative is paramount in the minds of others and being disappointed, even angry that this is not the case. This is happening because you're using a damaging metaphor to frame the entire experience and associating your power and narrative constructions with something that ought to be universal to the table. You are doing this because you're pretending there is this SIS thing outside you, and there isn't. Not even a little bit. Not even for the purpose of making loose observations or building more sophisticated ones later. <br/><br/>SIS sucks. It's irredeemably corrupt and is making your games and analysis demonstrably worse. Stop it.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to hijack this thread, but the SIS assumption is so  that it needs to be kicked in the teeth before I can even *talk* about discrimination specific issues.<br/><br/>Let us consider a model of individual participation:<br/><br/>Identity?Rationale-Internal Narrative-Public Narrative<br/><br/>The dashes represent components that have a transparent relationship to the player. Rationale is *why* you are forming the narrative ("My character would probably be racist and in the game setting, would say X"). Internal Narrative is the vision, Public Narrative is its expression. <br/><br/>The ? separates Identity, the player's subject position (upbringing/culture/gender affiliation/etc.), which is is transparent in some places and not in others, depending on the person. It nevertheless is the basis the player uses for every subsequent step.<br/><br/>In other words: Except to the extent that you cannot account for your Identity, the process is transparent for you. You know why you did it.<br/><br/>Now, consider a process of reaction. "A" is the event/player being reacted to:<br/><br/>Identity?Rationale-Internal Narrative-Public Narrative-Public Narrative A |? Internal Narrative  A|? Rationale A|? Identity A<br/><br/>| is the point where the other person does not know how one element follows to the next. I've put ? beside it because we can have:<br/><br/>1) Situations where the element is not known |<br/><br/>2) Situations where the element is known in part ?<br/><br/>. . . and these are not stopping points. I might know someone's sense of Identity pretty well, but not how other stuff follows from it.<br/><br/>These |? states are the source of a great deal of confusion, because each player has a far fuller awareness of their participation than anyone else's. When we think in terms of a faux-autonomous "space," we are drawing on our full participation cycle but only a fraction of the other person's. We may (by, for example, intimating the other person is "insecure") even use the false space to assume knowledge of elements of the other person's process to which we are not privy.<br/><br/>The most vexing thing, when it comes to bigotry is this: In most psychologically healthy, ethical adults, bigotry is the result of reflexive expressions of Identity. You say annoying things because you were raised that way, you have unresolved issues or you come from a different culture, and the full process of expression comes from a place that is not transparent to you. Note that this is not a justification for saying annoying things; rather, it's incumbent upon the individual to explore their actions, correct them and acquire better habits.<br/><br/>So consider this:<br/><br/>1) Many people who have been discriminated against have experienced it in a reflexive form.<br/><br/>2) These people do not have a guaranteed insight into your participation process.<br/><br/>3) Therefore, they do not necessarily know whether your contribution is reflexive discrimination or a studied simulation with safe limits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111808/#Comment_111808" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-04T23:25:57+00:00" title="December  4, 2007 11:25PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Continued)<br/><br/>Note that I'm leaving out gaming with consciously bigotted ideologues (like Neo-Nazis) because I don't think anybody here games with them. I'm also simplifying and not including the type that says something annoying reflexively, but employs arguments to excuse a lack of self-analysis. And not that when I use psychologically healthy" and "bigotry" together, I'm saying that basically, everybody fucks up and has fucked up beliefs but that does not make them bad people, but it also doesn't excuse continual uncorrected errors.<br/><br/>The above post is culled from my personal notes on theory, and I'll add to it another concept: Interior Access. This is a bit of craft I developed a few years ago, but I doubt I invented it. Interior Access is play with a focus on creating transparency when we witness other people contribute. Here's what it is:<br/><br/>1) It is an explicit right to interrogate the player about motives.<br/><br/>2) The player being interrogated may not refer to firm system elements (getting bonuses, etc.) -- this analysis is about the player. It's personal.<br/><br/>3) The player *may* refer to abstract game/narrative elements (what my character would do and why, what I want from the store), but the interrogator may choose to ask for information that's deeper than these constructions.<br/><br/>4) The interrogator may not express an opinion until after completing the interrogation.<br/><br/>5) The interrogator may not attach a value judgment to the player in response, but may express doubts and critiques of the player's contribution process.<br/><br/>I developed Interior Access as a GMing technique, but it could be used without that position. It can be intense, because the player literally has nowhere to hide -- not behind system, setting, character or anything else. You don't use it all the time and it comes and goes, since everybody sits in the hot seat eventually and learns to own their own decisions, understand where other people are coming from and volunteer their interior process. Things will build up again, but you have IA to deal with it.<br/><br/>I recommend it for issues like this because we get the right to learn about each other and understand what's going on. Critique stings less because it doesn't come out of left field -- you are *expected* to say something when the situation above occurs and run through IA.<br/><br/>Let me end by saying that there are power relations at work at the table too that are Identity based, founded on perceived notions of an Other and historical issues that run deep. I'm not talking about them so much here not because I don't think they matter, but because they're a tremendously complex subject I have several, parallel streams of thought about right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw" title="Southpaw"><img alt="Southpaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://his.randomscribbling.com/ds/wp-content/uploads/JonahHex1sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Southpaw">Southpaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111824/#Comment_111824" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T04:01:32+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  4:01AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarrod</cite>Presented with the situation, I might have played a character who was wholly against slavery; but I still would've immediately shot a slave simply to keep them from mobbing us, and to fit in with my white breathren.

When playing a roleplaying game (with strangers or not), the assumption should first be that the character speaks only for the character, not for the player.

I'm not saying it's wrong to be shocked, and I'm not saying I was happy about the situation as it unfolded, as a few have suggested.

My point in this case is pretty clear: Antebellum Virginia, slave revolt, dead plantation owners and an all-white group of characters only come up with one solution, like the inevitable result of an algebraic equation.  Everyone entering into that situation, GM and player alike, should have considered how that would have to play out.<br/><br/>If people are responsible for themselves, as you suggest, then they are first responsible for understanding what they're getting into.

Sure, but he didn't and I didn't and no one else did, either, so there's that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111859/#Comment_111859" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T06:15:23+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  6:15AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 6:16AM by Ron Hammack.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam I Am</cite>Ron, that's really splitting a hair that doesn't exist.  My point in this case is pretty clear: Antebellum Virginia, slave revolt, dead plantation owners and an all-white group of characters only come up with one solution, like the inevitable result of an algebraic equation. Everyone entering into that situation, GM and player alike, should have considered how that would have to play out. Something similar has happened with a few participants in this thread, which I find quite disappointing.</blockquote>\nThat inevitable result is only inevitable <i>if</i> you're approaching the game from the standpoint of historical accuracy. Obviously the GM in this game was interested in something other than historical accuracy. You didn't know that because:<br/><br/>1) he didn't tell you, and<br/>2) you didn't ask.<br/><br/>Now, I ranked those in order of responsibility, but you do see, don't you, that you're responsible for one of the things on the list? He might have fucked up first, but you still fucked up. \n<blockquote>If people are responsible for themselves, as you suggest, then they are first responsible for understanding what they're getting into.  I made an assumption regarding the maturity of the other players and suffered for it -- and for the rest of the session I played my character like a buffoon -- but everyone else made an assumption about<i>me</i>without considering all the factors involved.</blockquote>\n"They fucked up too" doesn't negate "I fucked up". Assumptions bad. Don't make them.<br/><br/>(I'm not even going to touch "a few participants in this thread" because that's so hopelessly vague that my assumptions about who you're talking about would probably be way off. Assumptions bad. Don't make them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111974/#Comment_111974" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T10:31:20+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:31AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm, I respect your opinions about the SIS; for you and yours, they probably work out quite well.
