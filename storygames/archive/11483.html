This is a game that deserves more space than this thread can provide.</blockquote>\nWe (Remi, Joel, Clinton and I) rotate responsibility for facilitating or GMing a game, every 3-5 weeks. Remi was up, and wanted to run <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a>, a proven system we absolutely love. We cast about for a setting that grabbed us, and Remi mentioned the Financial Times article on <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/628a8500-ff1c-11de-a677-00144feab49a.html" rel="nofollow">Moscow's metro-riding dogs</a>. It immediately grabbed all of us and we knew we had a winner. This post is more about that game than our setting.<br/><br/>So with Archipelago, one of the setup tasks is establishing ownership of the important fictional elements. After some discussion we came up with the City, Outsiders, Humans, and the Weather. We each took ownership of one of these, and agreed we'll switch it up every session. I was in charge of outsiders, so when Joel framed a scene in which Clinton's dog was cornered by wild dogs, it was up to me to paint them as deranged, gigantic half-wolf dogs from the forest, sort of crazy and terrifying. Remi then took the lead as the pack alpha and went to town.  <br/><br/>We each came up with a character concept - mine was "a fat, lazy hospital guard dog, well acclimatized to humans." We tied each character indirectly to at least two others, a very important step. My dog had ties to Remi and Joel's dogs.<br/><br/>We then made a map. I'd brought a map of the metro and a map of Moscow proper for names and inspiration, and we hand drew our own consisting of the areas that would be important in play. We each added two, and more might show up later. We had Pushkin hospital, the neighboring metro station, Gorky park, a fish market, the steam tunnel network, and some other areas. <br/><br/>One of the coolest features of Archipelago is the creation and implementation of destiny points, which sounds really hokey but is fantastic in play. We all sketched out our dogs and what they were like. Then we each wrote a potential destiny for the session for each dog. So I wrote "Valentin submits to his new alpha, Hudo, his former lieutenant" for Remi, and Clinton and Joel also gave him destiny options, from which he chose the one he liked best. I chose "Chajnik becomes addicted to painkillers", which seemed weird, fitting, and full of potential complications later. Clinton's choice, authored by Joel, was "So hungry ... that old man is so weak ..." These absolutely drive Archipelago play. We had four clear points to drive toward and everybody worked to get each of us where we needed to be before the session could properly end.<br/><br/>A lot emerged during table talk and setting up the map and destiny points - we learned about the "alpha of alphas", Tima, ruler of the Moscow dog world, for example. He lives in the steam tunnels and never ventures up to the surface. Because I am sort of insane, I'd made a list of cool Russian and pseudo Russian phrases related to a dog's life, and that got referenced a little and added spice and color.<br/><br/>Other stuff emerged in play. We discovered that humans don't talk - they just make garbled Charlie Brown noises. We learned about new packs and their territory. And we tightened our relationships to one another. Archipelago II makes this all very easy and compelling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255739/#Comment_255739" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T09:46:28+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  9:46AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my slang list.

I'm playing Batkin, a wild dog who lived with a pack in a park on the outskirts of Moscow. That pack killed a man, and all of them except me were captured by dog-catchers. I'm making my way into town, looking for a new alpha.<br/><br/>I have a fault that I can't play a really bad character. I try! But it never happens. This character's interesting to me because he's killed a man before and did again in this session, but the morality of the situation is so far removed from a human killing a human. In both situations, it's something I had to do, and I have no real interest in humans. I don't think Batkin would kill another dog. In fact, I had a chance in my first scene, and didn't. It's fun playing a character who knows his place in society and doesn't want to change it. I'm a solid beta dog, and couldn't be an alpha. Playing a good-hearted follower is fun, especially when there's lots of not-good-hearted leaders around to confuse me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255747/#Comment_255747" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T10:14:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 10:14AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Batkin was sorely used in the first session, to be sure.

Giving different flavor to different metro stations must be fun (especially when describing it from a the dogs senses point of view). <br/><br/>City and Humans seem like basic elements needed to run the game.

When Batkin rode he got lost, and we arranged for him to end up in the station where Valentin was delivering a rabble-rousing address to a bunch of pack alphas. We moved seamlessly from one scene to another, and Batkin got to eavesdrop, then meet Valentin. A little dramatic monkey-wrenching goes a long way -we just assume our characters are important and involved in whatever is happening as the default.<br/><br/>We went with Outsiders to color the game a certain way - we want pressure from outside Moscow to threaten. So gangs of menacing, evil dogs are going to show up and try to take over, probably after our characters have a firm grip on the city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255759/#Comment_255759" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T10:53:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 10:53AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious.

Archipelago feels well suited for middle-term play, and I thought we'd be chugging along for six sessions or something, but you cannot argue with fate, and fate ended us. Actually fate <i>cards </i>ended us!<br/><br/>So Tima's power base is corroded, his beta Ubitsa is gone and he's feeling weak. Valentine insinuates himself as his advisor. This becomes one axis for the session - the traditional ways and closer connection to the humans and the city.<br/><br/>The <i>other </i>axis is Slava's messianic move-to-the-country-and-run-with-the-wolves message, which has some traction with the ever-dutiful Batkin and Dasha. Chajnik, the fat hospital guard dog, is playing both sides against the middle. His destiny is "bites the hand that feeds him".<br/><br/>We drew a lot of fate cards this session - three or four, for five players - and each one destablized and pushed the action toward a conclusion. Some of the destiny points were also fitting end points for characters - Batkin's was "I kill a wolf", which hinted at martyrdom<i> just a little.</i><br/><br/>So Batkin killed a wolf indeed, saving the canine messiah Slava and being ripped to shreds in the process. Slava's vision was a false one, the wolves were stupid savages, his dream was a lie. Hooray!<br/><br/>Valentine's destiny was to become a hero by rescuing a human child. He roped Chajnik (who was masterless and helpless, utterly dependent on humans for survival and cast out into the world after his act of rebellion) into his dumb plan and, as it turned out (we were rewarded with a "No, and..." resolution) both dogs were caught on the subway tracks. The kid was rescued, Valentine became a hero and got a little statue, but both dogs were dead.<br/><br/>Dasha and her pups found a safe home in a fish market, where the pups caught the eye of an animal rescue lady. Dasha's destiny - her and her pups find safety among wealthy humans. After some challenges there was a "Yes, but..." resolution, and the "but" was that it wasn't the same wealthy humans - all her pups were split up and she ended her days as a guard dog in a junk yard. Sad. Five characters, five bad endings as it happened.<br/><br/>We were all a little surprised at the grim outcomes and the speed with which the game wrapped, but drawing fate cards accelerates everything. It felt right and was a very fun session.<br/><br/>One interesting mechanical note - we struggled just a little bit with wanting to inject some resolution into scenes that strongly pointed at destiny points. So we did, and sort of negotiated the outcomes. This felt the slightest bit hinky but we were good with it. For example, we know that Batkin is going to kill a wolf. The scene is set where there are wolves that need killing. Action! Jumping for throats! We know how this goes down, because it is Batkin's destiny, but we still drew a resolution card, which pushed the outcome into a particular direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259534/#Comment_259534" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T05:42:36+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  5:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2010 5:43AM by Matthijs.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've also had Archipelago campaigns suddenly end before I thought they would.

I don't think it is a weakness - the game's end felt very organic. We had the power to stretch it out by choosing less dramatic destiny points and being more judicious about fate draws. One draw per session seemed to keep things interesting but measured.
