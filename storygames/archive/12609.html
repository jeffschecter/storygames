Blind, deaf, missing limb, etc. don't grab me as interesting roleplaying hooks. I'm not sure how you would tell a "greedy" character from the usual RPG character. Coward offers some possibilities, but for lots of games really playing a coward means you aren't involved in the interesting parts of the game.<br/>I like the idea of complications that can be tagged in ICONS and other similar systems. That seems to draw out more interesting possibilities.<br/><br/>What are some things that would make for compelling hinderances? Are there any systems out there that have really great sets of example flaws?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283237/#Comment_283237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T06:45:53+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  6:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many of the Keys in <i><a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/Crunchy_Bits" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday</a></i> are essentially things that will make a character's life wonderfully complicated, like a dependent, or a vow, or a mission, or some drive like bloodlust or compassion or curiosity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283252/#Comment_283252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T07:14:00+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  7:14AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            L5R (3rd ed, haven't seen 4th) has always stood out for me in this regard.

I like the FATE system because it rewards players for introducing them into the story themselves, rather than having the GM / Storyteller / Uberfuhrer of the game smack them round the head with it like a rubber truncheon. Not that this approach isn't valid, it can be quite fun to be limited by the games master. I just find it more satisfying to have complete control over my character, yet still have a reason to act like a total douche when it fits my persona's personality.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283261/#Comment_283261" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-28T07:48:06+00:00" title="July 28, 2010  7:48AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash,<br/>\n  You beat me to it!<br/>\n  Yeah, Aspects from FATE are the best examples of traits that affect character behavior and uniqueness.<br/>\n  Solar System Keys are great.
