You assemble a box full of random objects and then pull them blindly to both inform the situation and resolve conflicts. <br/><br/>The story that crawled out of our box was about a wealthy Edwardian family getting taken in by a charlatan in Waltham, Massachusetts. There was sex, there were health tonics, there were copies of the Bhagavad Gita.\ufeff<br/><br/>An old pocket watch told us we were in 1910 Waltham. <br/>A biplane toy told us I was playing George Hall, factory owner.<br/>A bejeweled elephant told us Kate was playing Charlotte Hall, a society lady enthralled with Eastern mysticism.<br/>A tin toy car told us JD was playing Owen Hall, 15 year old scion of the family with a yearning for the declasse.<br/>A knitted snail told us our collective heart's desire was the simple, ascetic life promised by Brahminananda, an itinerant swami visiting Waltham.<br/><br/>There was a cool scene where Charlotte invited Swami Brahminananda over for dinner and George was hostile and deeply skeptical, sensing - correctly - that this guy was more grifter than spiritual teacher. Charlotte mentioned George's dyspepsia (I had drawn a wine bottle cork earlier to indicate what was keeping him from his heart's desire - George's sybaritic lifestyle). The swami excused himself to the kitchen and whipped up an Ayurvedic tonic. Would George be won over? I drew from the box and got - Charlotte's elephant!

I ran this. Though it's fun, I don't run it that much because it really only fills 2-3 hours before I feel mentally exhausted from the improv. My daughter really enjoyed it.<br/>- Mutant Crawl Classics. The GM who ran this is a super old-school fan who wanted to try it out. We both seem less than impressed in the after discussion (but for me that was little surprise, since DCC's philosophy never seemed to me to have any redeeming value over other dungeon crawly options on the market.)<br/>- Pathfinder Society with some friends. We played an adventure where we diverged from the narrative (as in "we know what's up with this NPC and we know it would be best if he came with us right now). The GM self-awaredy confessed that he realizes that if this were a home game, this would be the point to take it off the rails, but for the purposes of organized play, he was sticking with the script. This, coupled with the Know Direction podcast I was listening to on my drive home, led me to a bit of introspection on varying philosophy of "functional bits" of published adventures. That could spawn a thread of its own if I had a moment to spare for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459127/#Comment_459127" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T02:22:16+00:00" title="January 10, 2017  2:22AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2017 9:52AM by Rafu.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I attended a small convention where I played 4 games over 2 days, all run/hosted by me. Because of convention guidelines, these all had to fit within 3-hour slots:\n<ul><li>A crowded session of <i>Dread</i> (of the Jenga kind) set in 1917 on the Italian front. This was my usual non-hack of using Dread for a straight-up foot soldiers in WWI game, no "horror" other than the war itself - and only departing from by-the-book Dread in that I don't actually write a scenario (except for character questionnaires) but rather improvise most of it. Most of the time, it's soldiers and low-ranking officers dealing with the boring day-to-day chores of trench warfare and dying random, tragic deaths. Much of the fun of the session came from leveraging the language barrier of having a majority of the players speak in a shared dialect just two players couldn't understand (which reflects the historical reality of WWI era Italy).</li>\n<li>A game of <i>Dog Eat Dog</i>, marked by the Occupation player going really over-the-top with representing an absurd, crazy culture we Natives had no hope to reason with. It overwhelmingly became an eco-parable about wasting resources. Fun was had.</li>\n<li><i>Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands</i>, where we flirted like no tomorrow, which really payed off for the two of us playing entirely unreasonable but immensely charismatic Bantraesh and ultimately turning our enemies into our new allies - or willing toys. The relationship between my beautiful, radiant Bantraesh prince and a kind, down-to-earth housewife turned revolutionary leader quickly (d)evolved into a <i>Fifty Shades of Bantral</i> scenario. I have decided that 4 is my favorite number of players for <i>Firebrands</i> - there were five of us this time and I don't believe everyone got enough of a share of the spotlight.</li>\n<li><i>Lovecraftesque</i>, using the <i>Face of Evil</i> scenario. Deep Ones turned out to be the Final Horror, but I believe we managed to put the scary back into Deep Ones. Having now played <i>Lovecraftesque</i> twice, once without cards and once using them, I don't really see the point of special cards - I feel like the extremely simple rules in the "Playing without cards" sidebar are a much less confusing way to achieve the same net effect.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delvidian" title="Delvidian"><img alt="Delvidian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/061/nL25IJ7607XRN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delvidian">Delvidian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459135/#Comment_459135" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T12:42:44+00:00" title="January 10, 2017 12:42PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate Core Bulldogs!

The Queen has co-opted two of the other three PCs into her gang via the sex move.<br/><br/>The Werewolf (girl raised by wolves model) left a supernatural enemy alive. She and her adoptive sister had been grounded, but the Queen managed to convince the parents to let them out for ice cream. The NPC step-sister had been sleeping with the Fae, and she ran to the Fae, saying "You sprung me!" and started kissing the Fae.<br/><br/>The Werewolf had also had sex with the Fae and did likewise, to my delight, causing the adoptive sister to stomp off, furious and humiliated. And, even better, the Fae's attempt to smooth things over crashed and burned. So, while the Queen's hive did take care of the adoptive sister, feeding her ice cream and sending her home, off stage, when the Werewolf arrived home, the first question the parents asked was "Where is your sister?" Naturally, the answer is "kidnapped by the supernatural enemy", which the Werewolf figured out as we broke. I was about to type "She may not want to tell her parents that", but -- well, the player's having a blast with "raised by wolves", and the Werewolf blurts things out, extremely bluntly, so... we'll see.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459188/#Comment_459188" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T21:00:14+00:00" title="January 11, 2017  9:00PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Monsterhearts with 2nd edition sneak peek pack.

At each century we jump in -- we started during the Crusades and keep revisiting every couple of centuries, typically during wartime -- we the players create the thumbnails of the person our characters are jumping into. I've gone from being a princess in one age to a pauper who scavengers battlefields in another. I love how the current GM has injected so much collaborative storytelling into the arc. Not what one usually expects of GURPS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459309/#Comment_459309" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T01:00:44+00:00" title="January 16, 2017  1:00AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2017 1:03AM by Rafu.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Everway</i>, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20934/rafu-s-everway-archipelago" rel="nofollow">in a GM-less variant of my own devising</a>.<br/><br/>It's largely an <i>Archipelago</i> hack, but it also integrates all components from the original game: the Fate Deck, Vision Cards, element wheel, powers and magic, etc. Essentially, what used to be GM prep in classic <i>Everway</i> becomes a collective, ongoing effort of making sense of a Realm's oracle - a process which effectively replaces <i>Archipelago</i> Destiny Points. I also included various bits from a work-in-progress I call <i>The Fourth King</i> (in turn a spin-off from my white whale project <i>Cast Down from Eden</i>) which are meant to give the game a certain episodic structure, with most conflicts exploding and being resolved near the end of an episode.<br/><br/>This was the first session - excepting an afternoon we spent creating characters a couple weeks ago - and, of course, mostly a playstorming.

Once more we found ourselves in a Realm with serious problems of policy due to a malicious and inept ruling class after the king had passed out, and once more there was violent rioting - but this time the status quo was finally restored. Once again isolationism was involved, but of a more mundane sort, and people in charge feeding their subjects lies, but the lie itself was much more complicated. A PC went on an involuntary killing spree again, but not the same PC as before, and this happened under magical compulsion. Once more we fought against dark magic and my PC failed to learn our enemies' arts because our enemies were dead.

A couple of the Agents undercut each other as one decided to kill a potential source of information on the grounds that the man was a Nazi and a cultist, which is legit, especially as she had a Drive of Revenge specifically against cultists. So, she rigged the man's toilet to explode. Another agent decided to set off the explosion when it wouldn't kill anyone, including the target, on the grounds that she wanted him alive until they knew everything he did. Ironically, this was the one Jewish Agent.<br/><br/>We began character generation for a game of Princess: The Hopeful, which I'm playing in and not gming -- yay!<br/><br/>We also had a session of Diaspora, where my PC, Graf Linus von Schultz, also known as the Butcher of Old Terra, on account of sending nukes and missiles against crowded areas (the first wasn't him, but he took credit for Reasons, while the second was him, and was him nuking his family castle for actually good and sufficient reasons, and when the area was unpopulated by civilians, I think) is trying to figure out a) whether he needs to be ready to blow anything up, b) whether taking credit for looming catastrophe will mean those who hate him will get their act together to stop the catastrophe (not exactly his fault -- had to do with unrealized side effects of space elevators that grow on their own), and c) whether anyone can disarm a nuke that an enemy just set to go off right next to where he and his companions are. This coming week, we will hopefully find out whether everyone's dead or the bomb got disarmed, and perhaps just what we can do about the growing space elevator before it does something nasty to the Earth's seas or crust or something -- neither Linus nor I quite understand the technology involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459514/#Comment_459514" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T06:03:51+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  6:03AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This weekend was Kapcon, my local annual convention! <br/><br/>Played:<br/>- Fall of Magic<br/>- Tales From The Loop<br/>- (my own, almost finished) Three Dooms<br/>- Life On Mars<br/>- (my own, also almost finished) Heavy Metal \xc6ons<br/>- Feng Shui 2<br/>- Ghost Court<br/>- Monster of the Week (as a hunter)<br/><br/>All of those were great fun, but probably my top games were Fall of Magic (it was with two really great other players), Heavy Metal \xc6ons (because it was really fun and seems like I've smoothed out the last issues in the rules), and Tales From The Loop (because it is just so great, and this was another game with great players who got totally into the setting).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459550/#Comment_459550" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-24T10:13:03+00:00" title="January 24, 2017 10:13AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kapcon was pretty great this year. <br/><br/>I facilitated:<br/>- Bluebeard's Bride (twice)<br/>- a playtest of my game, The Perfect Heist<br/>- Love in the Time of the Seith<br/>- 183 Days<br/>- Cartel<br/><br/>... and I played in Farflung and Ghost Court.<br/><br/>Bluebeard's Bride was something I felt I got better at GMing as I went along.

The game didn't resolve in time because our characters started out too far apart fictionally from one another. I think our group took a little too much liberty with the rules; for example, people would really stretch what  aspects of the story were covered by their "Resources" and try to control the story too much using them very liberally. I think there was too much conflict and players trying to control the story individually, rather than working together to make the story better. It's funny, I think typical groups would under use the rules and I felt we overused them. I think Archipelago is probably a really great game if people are willing to share the story, but I didn't feel like it was our best effort in that regard and people used the game's tools to push their agenda rather than build something together.<br/><br/>We've also been playing Freeform Universal. I like the dice outcomes and their interpretive nature, but I think the three session campaign  was enough for us and we're done with the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459650/#Comment_459650" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-27T14:33:36+00:00" title="January 27, 2017  2:33PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Preservant<br/>official blog : <a href="http://www.bendutter.com/sigil-stone-publishing/perseverant-rpg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bendutter.com/sigil-stone-publishing/perseverant-rpg/</a><br/>finished KS : <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sigilstonepublishing/perseverant-rpg-a-survival-story-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sigilstonepublishing/perseverant-rpg-a-survival-story-game</a><br/><br/>The fiction rolled out well.<br/>The events succeeded one another without impediments.<br/>And the betrayal mechanics was just SOOOOO sweet <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I also liked how, even when you win a challenge, you lose evidently more than you get.

We started late and everybody was tired, so we didn't actually finish the scenario (which was <i>A Lost Smile</i> straight from the book, of course) - though I was under the impression that we could have reached a conclusion quickly hadn't we been that sleepy, with just 1 more hour or less of focused play.<br/>I was the GM and there were 3 witch+cat pairs and I was satisfied that it <i>didn't</i> feel like an overwhelming number of players - which is quite unusual. I had printed out character sheets (a simple, quick and dirty layout using a fancy font to make it look more compelling) with game terms translated to our local language and including the complete skill list: this sped up char-gen, though at least one player complained of having to roll too many dice (not about the randomness of char-gen, but about the actual time it took to roll 1d6 twenty-six times in a row and record the results -- I guess we're just spoiled by sleek and focused modern designs).<br/>The one thing everybody loved was the Cat Magic spell list, of course!<br/>One small thing I changed was that I handed out Portent and Shadow cards as the very first step in creating characters. Thus, players already had a vision for the character to strive to achieve when they picked their skills.<br/>Another change I made was, instead of attempting to roll doubles on 2d6 I hacked challenges into attempting to roll 1s on 1d6. This has the same probability, but significantly shorter handling time because you can roll your entire dice pool at a time, instead of re-rolling over and over. Sure, attempting to roll doubles feels more "magical", but I still believe this was a good idea.<br/>Something I unexpectedly got confused about is that some skills - such as Fortune Telling, say - appear to duplicate magical effects, so players kept asking to roll for challenges against those skills rather than engaging the spell-casting system - thus generating reduced opportunities for spectacular failures.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459701/#Comment_459701" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-29T03:28:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2017  3:28AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This week was the once a month grand conjunction where I play my periodic games 3 days in a row:<br/>Thursday: Night's Black Agents. Now in full improv mode running the Dracula Dossier. The players orchestrated a raid on an Edom (corrupt vampire-control branch of MI6) safehouse/prison; I used it as a chance to let them meet some prisoners who I hope will play into longer term plots for the game.<br/><br/>Friday: Mutants &amp; Masterminds. I ran a weird scenario where the players had to intervene in a fight between Dollface (a self replicating AI who likes to play dress up and similar games) and the Chessmen (technology thieves who irritated Dollface by stealing one of her technology caches). A lot of the fun of this game derives from how the players view their contribution to the setting. For example, the Rook (resident batman clone)'s player describes his headquarters and behavior to emulate the campiness of the old Adam West series.<br/><br/>Saturday: Pathfinder.

Our third session so far, and my PC has undone a dangerous mind-control spell by <i>swallowing</i> it (in the guise of a crumpled piece of vellum) - which is likely to cause more trouble later on.<br/>I'm still hammering bits of the game design into shape as we play. As of today, I've altered the flashpoint/crisis resolution part into a version I'm pretty satisfied with. Now I realize I have to focus on the mechanical character development rules, to make them less wishy-washy and more reliable. We've agreed on an apparently small adjustment to the "main" part of the game which will make it diverge much more significantly from its core <i>Archipelago III</i> chassis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV" title="NovanIV"><img alt="NovanIV" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV">NovanIV</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459756/#Comment_459756" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T17:52:04+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  5:52PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday we continued our running Blades in the Dark game "The Good Shepherds", which are a group of smugglers, that (mainly) deal in passengers who prefer discretion.  Our enemy, Lord Scurlock, is doing some shady stuff out at sea, and so our response was to arm our boat, which naturally involved a job to make the money to pay for that!  We fought off some pirates and stole and sold their boat as well which got us some extra coin, but we were all on the brink of taking a trauma by the end of the score.<br/><br/>Wednesday I started running a new game of Sorcerer, inspired by the Shin Megami Tensei series.  I've never done Sorcerer before, so it should be interesting learning.  Wednesday was really just tying the two PCs kickers together.  One was investigating the sudden disappearance of the one that got away, while the other was out for revenge for the murder of his dead friend.  I made the dead friend a key lead in the first PC's investigation (and tied into my background stuff), so now they decided to look into it together for now.  Looking forward to seeing where this goes, has a bit of a noir feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459759/#Comment_459759" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-30T18:38:00+00:00" title="January 30, 2017  6:38PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Jeff, designers like to have their games discussed in public, generally.

The player whose PC was avoiding trouble is now on the find a dumb idea and carry it out bandwagon (huzzah!), having decided that he should cast the Ring of Lies on his father so that his father would stop lying to his mother (she assumed he's having an affair, and he doesn't want to say "I'm looking into occult family history"). The father is currently in the hospital (which is in the next town).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Werewolf, who was "merely" raised by wolves, as opposed to turning into a literal wolf, just murdered a man who had skinned one of her wolf siblings and shot another. In the case of the second, what he saw was wolves jumping on this poor girl and then chasing her. What was happening was that she was whimpering to Mommy Wolf and her siblings that the sister of the family that adopted her was gone, her trail just ending in mid-step, then heard the rifle being readied, then told her wolf family to run and did likewise.<br/><br/>Did I mention that the Werewolf and the Fae had sex with the Queen, who's the alien hive mind type, not the normal human type?<br/><br/>So, yeah, they were both getting a headfull of this, and all of this was going on when the Queen called the Witch and he decided to sense through the Werewolf's senses, and she and her wolf family ripped the guy's throat out.<br/><br/>Queen, on phone to Witch: I'm a little busy -- I'm in something very sticky.<br/><br/>Witch: Yeah, I'm getting some of that.<br/><br/>So double entendre-y, and the situation actually wasn't sexual. Just bloody.<br/><br/>And the Werewolf was all about Finding Sister NOW, so... yeah, the wolves ate all the flesh, at the Queen's urging, but bones... Wolves aren't pigs, and we agreed that, no, no one took the time to bury or supervise wolves burying, bones.<br/><br/>So, yeah, authorities / adults, as things shake down, know:<br/><br/>The Witch's father had a heart attack and is in the hospital with his wife watching over him.<br/>Someone got killed and eaten by wolves, bones picked clean -- gotta do something about the wolves in the wood. It's just not safe!<br/>The mayor's daughters, natural (NPC)  and adopted (Werewolf) keep getting menaced in the woods.<br/>The local gang is bothering the Witch. (Not untrue, but really complicated.)<br/>The Queen's gang tried to pressure the Witch into letting them break into his father's safe. <br/><br/>That last is not true at all. He was trying to break in, and one of the gang had arranged to get a key made. Problem is, she wound up in the hospital after fainting due to the hive mind thing with all the blood and confusion.<br/><br/>Now, the Queen isn't so good about phoning her gang, cuz telepathy. The Witch had to remind her.<br/>But, the gang member in the hospital with the key got a call from the Queen, so kept trying to phone the Witch because she wanted to deliver the key to him in person, no mistakes, right?<br/>But, the Witch wasn't answering his phone -- it's 2005, and he has no idea who's calling on his cell phone, and isn't about to pick up.<br/>And the rest of the Queen's gang? So, one of them is trying to take over, and has no idea what was supposed to be happening, only that she couldn't reach the gang member in the hospital -- and, never thought to call her.<br/><br/>So, we're starting to get a perpetuating, snowballing mess, which is, I understand, what one is supposed to get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459925/#Comment_459925" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-05T17:52:01+00:00" title="February  5, 2017  5:52PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thursday: Night's Black Agents.

The system's working, while the story's singing - especially in terms of character arcs (showcasing their issues, slowly evolving their personalities). We're getting some good, enjoyable serial fiction out of this experiment - comparable to an episodic fantasy graphic novel.<br/><br/>This week around the Spheres, in the city of Holywater a pestilence had appeared which was, strangely, not causing a lot of deaths - but a lot of horror, pain and suffering - nor spreading very fast, as it had been confined within three well-quarantined city districts. Healthy citizens were holding games, with much pageantry and costuming, and sacrificing the winners by sending them into the quarantined areas, ostensibly as ritual "grooms" to Lady Plague. They maintained that this behavior - dictated by their oracle, a divine water spring - was effective at holding the plague itself at bay, or at least stalling it, by appeasing Lady Plague the personified pestilence spirit.<br/>Our Spherewalker characters of course couldn't accept such a state of thing, for a number of personal reasons (Barbara's character Merry was empathic with the fate of the winners, while Alessio's character Free-of-Chains is defiant of all authority, be it human or divine). They poked around, meddled, got entangled and - as usual for them - ended up inciting riots. We discovered that the Spring God itself had called the plague upon its own worshipers to punish them for their opportunistic religious behavior and was deliberately enforcing ineffective ways to deal with it in order to make them suffer longer.<br/>While Free-of-Chains was daringly rescuing some political prisoners, my character All-reading Ink successfully forced Lady Plague to manifest physically as a haunted tree and, with help from Merry, managed to coax the Spring God's name from it. All-reading Ink and Free-of-Chains went face Acheron the Spring God in its lair, but had underestimated the challenge and run into serious trouble. Meanwhile, "Brother" - Merry's parasitic demonic double - was having a face off with the Plague Tree and, in confrontation of raw magical power, defeated it.<br/>Ultimately, the plague was lifted and Acheron retreated from the holy spring and the city itself for fear of Brother, which - having fully taken possession of Merry's body - marched upon the temple and razed it to the ground. All-reading Ink could only save a bit of Acheron's essence in the form of black water, that he poured inside a silver vessel shaped like a fish -- an imprisoned godling now bound to answer any question the ambitious traveling mage will ask it. But we left the city in complete disarray and anarchy, its Fate (the King, sideways: authority vs tyranny) not yet resolved.<br/><br/>It's impossible through so brief a summary to account for how many character key issues are hit, reliably and dependably, over a 5-hour session such as the above, or just how exciting it is to us. There are a few loose ends we're going to tie up next session, including one boon (advancement option) Alessio still has to decide on for Free-of-Chains. I'm also considering how to handle a Realm's unresolved destiny - whether to, as a new rule, have it carry into the next episode and Realm somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459965/#Comment_459965" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T02:00:02+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  2:00AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Dungeon World: Fort Apache</i>, and some larps - <i>The Calamity of Morgard</i>, <i>Group Date </i>and <i>Limbo</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459974/#Comment_459974" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-06T06:41:37+00:00" title="February  6, 2017  6:41AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More <i>Masks</i>, more <i>The Veil</i> and a kick-ass game of <i>The God That Crawls</i>.

Its basic <i>Archipelago</i> architecture is getting less and less recognizable.<br/>We had to accept that the fate of a Realm <i>can</i> occasionally be left hanging, but completed our character advancement and other character-related bits from last time and went on to a new Realm - as intended. This time we managed to depict more of a rural, "tribal" (or, rather, extended family-focused) realm after too long a string of historically-cosmopolitan trading cities with complex systems of government but recent isolationist tendencies.<br/>For all the varied imagery of the Realms we visit, though, the meat of the game really is in the evolving relationships between the main characters, our three Spherewalkers. Wrap-up campsite conversation scenes - introduced as a sort of in-character debriefing and especially to focus on character advancement - can now be as tense as the main conflict extended scenes. Fulfilling these characters' Fates looms closer every week, but won't presumably end their story - just a major arc or "season".

The fanmail mechanic isn't quite clicking yet, but condensing the approaches to Charming, Cunning, and Daring is great! What more do you need -- besides chandeliers, I mean? Oh, and a fifth action of Deduction, which I've seen before. Seems to work well for this genre, as we're already in the mindset to treat it as just a path to the action.<br/><br/>Noirlandia: Luck Harvest. I got the game, so now I've an idea how to play it. One of the tighter games of the convention, although I suspect that actually tucking in all the loose ends neatly enough that it all makes perfect sense isn't going to happen a lot. It didn't here, but they were tucked in well enough that it didn't not make sense, which is really all that matters.<br/><br/>Thousand Arrows. I picked up one of the weirder allegiances to see how the game would handle it. Things worked surprisingly well -- we all started pulling in different directions, but everything came together at the end, which, amazingly, did not involve any of the PCs dying.<br/><br/>Supervillain Rehab, Season 3. This was awesome. There is something amazing in a game where I say, "... I was going to play Eris, goddess of chaos, but... that's redundant, so I'll play Taliesin instead." I want to play the rest of the season, especially given one of Jeff's thoughts.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts, with the Sneak Peek Pack. This was one of those games where it's a lot of fun, folks are pulling in different directions, and just as thing start to move towards a center and stuff gets really interesting, we're out of time. It happens -- you need the set up time for Monsterhearts, and most of the players hadn't played it before. And, given this Dreamation was the GM's first time running at a convention, I'm highly impressed.<br/><br/>Monsters and Other Childish Things. Kind of the opposite of the above in that it was part 1 of a 2 parter, and the GM needed to slow things down. Fortunately, that's really easy to do in MOCT. (I'd not realized it was a 2-parter, and had offered to withdraw in favor of someone who could make both slots, but was assured it wasn't necessary. As there were 3 players in part 1, counting me, that was the right call.)<br/><br/>Mars 244. This was odd in that I wound up with two outsider types for my characters. One made me uncomfortable, while I could do the other in my sleep, so I went with the one that made me uncomfortable for my primary. There were a couple of things I should've done a bit differently, but by and large, I was playing someone who wasn't that complicated, and who was a little lost, trying to figure out what to do to help, and ultimately, winding up doing the obvious thing for her to do because she didn't really know how to do anything else. As for my secondary, while I'd have liked a chance to do more, I think the one brief interruption I played, for a single shot, pretty much summed the character up.<br/><br/>Dread -- yeah, no. I should not try to play in a midnight-4am game after three back to back 4 hour games with no nap. At 1am or so, I made my apologies and crashed.<br/><br/>Chuubo: The best kind of game for a Sunday morning. It's a very unusual game, and by the time we'd started getting the hang of things, it was time to wrap everything up. I noted the obvious end point -- one player had established that his PC had invited mine to a tea ceremony, and mine had suggested two more come, and it was pretty easy to figure that everyone would wind up coming. Tony's thinking of doing a Long Con version of Chuubo, which would be awesome. He's also streamlined the system by dropping some things that are harder to fit into a convention session. As I'd not have known they were missing if I hadn't played with them, I think it's a good call.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460470/#Comment_460470" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-20T23:33:21+00:00" title="February 20, 2017 11:33PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last Sunday, we took a break in our ongoing <i>Everway</i>-ish thing in order to accommodate a visiting friend.

All had strong GMs and players. As for GMing, I ran Mystery Men using a Cortex Plus Action hack; our goal was to create a sequel to the film. I was psyched to run the system but by hour three was exhausted by the dice pool mechanic. I'm not sure if that was me or the system. I also ran two sessions of my Fate Accelerated Dune hack. The second session was interesting in that it was mostly social combat. The setup is that the players are the entourage of a House hosting a banquet for two other Houses. Between courses of the meal, the entourages of the houses are expected to put on "exhibitions" to entertain each other. I had markers for the three Houses, all placed on the "0" of a Fate ladder. The margin of success or failure in putting on these exhibitions moved the House marker up or down the ladder of prestige. The players were enormously creative. The Bene Gesserit did an interpretive dance to a fable of House history narrated by the Mentat. The Swordmaster and young Noble Heir made a show of swordsmanship. What was especially cool is how they threw shade at a competing Swordmaster by integrating his signature style in the mock duel and proving it ineffective against their House's style. The Planetologist gave an infotaining lecture about the exotic reproduction schemes of the local fauna. The Spymaster hung back to secretly sabotage other Houses' exhibitions, which he did with hand-wringing relish and flair. The players managed to make all the psych-outs and one-upmanship at this formal dinner feel so Dune. Now I have to figure out how to include a similar yet different scene in my Dexcon sequel this summer...                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460488/#Comment_460488" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T15:27:03+00:00" title="February 21, 2017  3:27PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Dreamation 2017:</b><br/><br/><b>Fate Space.</b> Played in Bill White's <i>Fate Core</i> game.

Of course, her tactic is to run up to them in the woods and shout "Don't shoot wolves! Don't shoot wolves!"<br/>The Queen -- who now considers the Fae and the Werewolf part of her gang -- has a plan to convince the town to have a nature preserve.<br/><br/>Q: How much space do your wolves need?<br/><br/>WW: A hundred thousand trees! Oh, and rabbits. A thousand rabbits!<br/><br/>The Queen is trying to get the Werewolf to read up on animals to understand how to explain the truth about animals to humans. The Fae is trying to teach the Werewolf how to shake hands and give friendly, rather than overly intimate, hugs.<br/>The Werewolf, you understand, is the raised-by-wolves variant.<br/><br/>The Fae is also trying to get the Witch to a) study with the Fae and b) tell the Fae what the Witch knows about the weird stuff. The Queen now has the papers the Witch wanted, and wants to try to read them before the Witch gets them.<br/><br/>Oh dear. I need to decide what's in them.<br/>Right, and why the whole fae courts in the woods thing is exploding now.<br/>Or, y'know, get the players to figure it out for me. That would also work. But, it's useful to have an "if everyone flounders" answer on the shelf, in case I need to dust it off. I've a vague sense of what's going on, which has been enough thus far. The less I'm the one inventing stuff, the better.<br/><br/>Oh, and I've named the man in the woods whom the Werewolf killed -- Old Steve. He probably has a relative who's going to show up to mourn and urge on the wolf hunt.<br/><br/>Hm... the Werewolf's player said she figured the Werewolf and the school nurse were on a first name basis by now.

The Investigators had been transported to the alternate world of Tellus, where the "Repairer of Reputations" was historical, America was an authoritarian one-party state and the other superpower was the Union of Syndicalist Socialist Republics, aka Communist France. Jimmy Wright was a dead superhero, they found an auto-abattoir of his parallel timeline versions he had killed, and China started World War...er, One; unfortunately, it was nuclear, so also World War Last--all a part of the plan for the King in Yellow to claim the world. Nice work with a smaller ensemble and the return of Lisa playing Millicent.<br/><br/><b>Masks of Nyarlathotep</b>, in Trail and for the Tuesday night meetup. I soft-pedaled the infamous Ju-Ju House battle; my reward for being so nice was the players deciding to do Shanghai first. So now I have to figure out how to revamp my Big Bad structure. Nice character play all around, and a fun fight with the two least combat-able characters facing off some cultists. Fortunately they kept the shotgun in the study loaded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460763/#Comment_460763" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T22:02:22+00:00" title="February 27, 2017 10:02PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought it was Charleston who was relentlessly cheerful.

First tested a method of "prepping for" the session (or, rather, basic lonely fun) - that's making up Usurper cards, for those familiar with <i>Everway</i> - and it worked.<br/>Another awesome session overall, and my character Ink is definitely at the end of his own Fate arc, having productively used magic to the benefit of all while resisting multiple temptations to just seize moar power.

Like, his "other self" kicked in, walked several miles to the only resident wizard of the realm and straight up murdered him, just like that.

Having rescued him from a Lamia that killed and replaced his wife, the NPC gave them a big info dump that revealed the location of a major base "misguided government secret vampire-tech force". They decided to go after it with no clear reason for doing so. We'll see how that plays out, but I am hoping to get them playing more subtly and less epic fantasy.<br/><br/>Friday's <b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds </b>game was oddly satisfying. I just dreamed up an evil plot and threw some supervillains together. Some stuff I did that proved oddly effective:<br/>1) Though I'm not one for lots of NPC banter, I decided to have the PCs get involved in a series of legal hearings regarding the fate of a number of "stormers", superhumans whose powers were recently activated and many of whom performed villainous activities while mind controlled. I did this mainly to introduce some NPCs from the Emerald City setting and establish the fate of several supers (including a subtle clue to upcoming evil plot), but it also got the players invested in the fate of a number of the stormers, like one who really didn't do anything violent, just disruptive, but who was about to become the shared victim of public furor.<br/>2) Against my normal modus operandi, I totally played one encounter for comedic effect. I don't like making the game seem farcical, but in terms of managing the emotional flow of the game, the encounter was a nice mood lightener leading into the heavier investigation and finale. In addition, one of the players opted not to fight, but make the over-the-top self-parodying villain reconsider his antisocial ways.<br/><br/>Saturday's <b>Pathfinder</b> was for the most part a straight up dungeon crawl. However, to access the site, they did have to convince two elders of the island's three clans to approve their expedition to the taboo island, which had some interesting lead-up roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461122/#Comment_461122" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-15T06:47:40+00:00" title="March 15, 2017  6:47AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2017 6:52AM by AsIf.">edited March 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On March 12th I ran a game of <i>DayTrippers</i> for the <i>Legends of Tabletop</i> crew.

We're making the palette for our story of alien civilizations in collision:<br/><br/>player 1: "I want a race of robots."<br/>player 2: "I want genocide."<br/>player 3: "I want mysticism, like spiritual beliefs."<br/>player 4: "I want a god-like race of aliens."<br/><br/>As our history unfolds, the robots, who we learn were created by humans after we discover remnants of mysterious Ancient technology, make contact with the not-as-dead-as-we-thought Ancients and achieve enlightenment. The rival alien races promptly unite to eradicate them: enlightened robot genocide.<br/><br/>Later in play we find out that the Ancients had previously tried bringing enlightenment to the other races -- including us humans, which explained our first contact -- but had failed or been rejected. Only the poor robots were young and innocent enough as a race to achieve enlightenment\u2026<br/><br/>And in our <i>Follow</i> game we played cowboys trying to save our town from Godzilla (ahem, "the Great Horned Devil") in the Wild West.

I hosted four games there:\n<ul>\n<li>Marc Hobbs's <i>Eden</i>. I was very excited about this game and looking forward to playing it, but it turned out quite disappointing. The setup part was, in my opinion, really good, but then the scenes we played turned out very bland - almost like we were missing something from our setup, actually. Most of the time, we were feeling around almost blandly for events and conflicts without actually finding any. We wrapped up our story after three rounds of scenes due to time constraints, but it didn't feel finished at all.</li>\n<li>Eppy Ravachol's <i>Sorceress Bloody Sorceress</i>, which I'd selected mostly because I needed a really quick game to squeeze into a 120' fraction of a longer slot due to, uhm, reasons. We had a large-ish group who weren't especially focused, but apparently fun was had. We rolled the bear sorceress: what a lovely character! Would definitely play again, if I could do so with a group of focused swords &amp; sorcery aficionados.</li>\n<li>Ashley Griffiths's <i>What You Wish For</i> was definitely the highlight of the convention. Barbara had already played this game twice, but I hadn't. It was an intense, affecting experience. It did poke at a few sore points, that's almost by design, but I enjoyed it immensely nonetheless. Even the fact it was late in the evening when we started playing and everybody was tired and sleepy couldn't make the game fall flat. I strongly recommend giving it a try if you haven't.</li>\n</ul>\nThe fourth game was an early playtest of a new design I'm working on - something I've named "RAD", now with the subtitle "Social Justice Science Fiction". It was both fun to play and a useful test, confirming what I hoped it would confirm and yielding a wealth of useful notes and suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461208/#Comment_461208" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-20T17:56:48+00:00" title="March 20, 2017  5:56PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Draug II, Dungeon World, and a 140 person boffer larp                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461215/#Comment_461215" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-20T20:38:56+00:00" title="March 20, 2017  8:38PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First date with Monster of the Week.

I wound up falling back on a fae war to push things when they needed a push (which is likely lazy of me, but likely something I fell back on because it's an easy thing to push and then step back from) a session or four in. First session, we had the running "how long can we put off the pop quiz about the (American) Civil War?"<br/><br/>So, the werewolf (actually, raised-by-wolves, not shapeshifter) got a See Me on the test, cuz she wrote "Brothers fought and that was bad." Her adoptive father spent some time trying to explain the deeper levels of the Civil War.

You just need a window.<br/><br/>Werewolf: The rabbits are way scarier than the woods<br/><br/>Veridian's player: I will note this has been the most class and the most acadamic I have seen in any Monsterhearts session ever.<br/><br/>Witch: But why did she promise the entire line?<br/>Me: Well, demons.<br/>Werewolf's Player: "Well, demons" is a pretty good answer to almost anything.<br/><br/>NPC: I just asked [Werewolf] if [Another NPC] was also raised by wolves, and she punched me in the nose!<br/>Fae: If you say that again, I'M gonna hit you in the nose!<br/><br/>Fae: He might not be all bad sides even if he's pure evil.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461309/#Comment_461309" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-23T16:03:17+00:00" title="March 23, 2017  4:03PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Unanswered Question</b> (1950s Tatters of the King in ToC): After returning from the alternate world of Tellus, the Investigators travelled to Kansas.

Being positioned right after all three main characters resolved and updated their Fates (worked out some of their issues, basically) it felt like a huge two-part episode bridging two seasons of some TV show.

Most of them had eaten themselves or others due to hunger and were basically insane and/or suicidal. The most functional were four of them that had multiclassed to monks.<br/><br/>The party found out that all the major threats to the setting were caused by them trying to escape unsuccessfully. On the ensuing fight, the party liberates the negative aspect of the god, darkness covers the world, the tieflings rush in masse to the exit... and the player with the ring of wishes says "I want to go back in time!". As awesomely fun as it sounded I couldn't resist and so she goes back... right before they get into the sealed place. <br/><br/>She manages to convince them to do things different this time. They choose right and liberate the positive aspect of the deity, they defeat the tieflings, slice the orb of infinite power in two... <i>and then a baby tarrasque ate half of it. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461497/#Comment_461497" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-28T01:08:47+00:00" title="March 28, 2017  1:08AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More Apocalypse World.

We're playing a group of arms dealers with links to the Skovlander refugees. The PC who got our group together is a former Skovlander guerilla fighter. I am playing a former imperial sniper and street rat from Crow's Foot.<br/><br/>This was my first session, but the other players third. We started the session with a meetcute with my character and two other PCs at a bar in Charhallow. My character got connected with the group through Hoxley, the group's contact and source of weapons, an Imperial Army Quartermaster of Skovland descent who my character served with. There was this great moment where my character eyes the others down tactically and realizes he had once shot the guerilla fighter.<br/><br/>We were rudely interrupted in our staredown by a group of anti-Skov hooligans who started making trouble in the bar. Runa, the guerilla fighter, talked the group down with an assist by me. They were right pissed off by it thanks to a devil's bargain I suggested. I pushed my luck, Surveying them as they left and found out there was divided leadership.<br/><br/>We decided we needed to know more about this group of hooligans and so we went to another bar and asked around. We found out they were part of a larger True Duskvol gang, financed by some noble with family issues.<br/><br/>Khara, our group's Iruvian Spider went to some high society functions and uncovered some twisted stuff about the financier I can get into if there's any interest. Meanwhile Candros Slane, my former imperial sniper, Casta, his bounty hunter friend, and Runa hunted down where the group meets. I rolled really well on my Hunt roll and was able to find the bar the True Duskvol types conduct their meetings at and when they were meeting next.<br/><br/>After a little bit of debate we decided we were going to take out this gang's leadership before they could come for us and take their bar for ourselves. The plan was relatively simple. Candros would sneak in the back. Runa, Khara, and our gang would show up front loaded to bear. Candros managed to sneak in, but was discovered by a member of the waitstaff. Candros is not a very nice man so he tossed a throwing knife in that fool's throat. Good thing he did because trouble could have been coming our way if he didn't.<br/><br/>We critted our engagement roll so Runa, Khara and the gang were able to catch the leadership of these True Duskvol types unaware. Candros laid down a bunch of suppressive fire, requiring the enemy to bring up tables to use for cover while Runa did her thing, and Khara helped. One massive firefight later we have a bar which counts as Local Graft, a bunch of Heat and Rep, and a decimated gang with -2 faction status. Candros also almost stressed out. I was one stress away from gaining a trauma in the first session.<br/><br/>Enter downtime. Candros and Casta meet at his house and make plans to search for Candros' wife and reflect on how Candros wants to make a better life for his kids. They also canvas the neighborhood for signs of where she might have gone. Candros does the insensitive not noticing a possible love interest thing.<br/><br/>Runa and Khara spend time researching ancient Skovland old ways and rituals.<br/><br/>That was an immense amount of fun. There's a bunch of cool interplays between the PCs, including a shared enemy of Veleris, the spy between our two hounds. Lots of neat racial tension. Also we killed a lot of people. That's a lot of angry ghosts.<br/><br/>Right now we're at the point where we have a lot of Rep and not much Coin. We need to make some money if we're going to go up in Tier. We also might want to reconsider our fast and loud ethos.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461513/#Comment_461513" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-29T06:20:03+00:00" title="March 29, 2017  6:20AM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played in Princess: the Hopeful, discovering that yes, really and truly, too much heat will make me zone out in the middle of serious drama. This sucks. We'll try a cooler apartment next time, and hopefully, both logical venues will be sufficiently air conditioned for the summer. (Some NYC apartments have central heating that can't be lowered. It's a thing.)<br/><br/>(Running through the variables -- I had sufficient sleep, sufficient but not excessive food, was sitting in the coolest spot in the room, but moving to the point of just sitting back meant it suddenly got a Whole Lot Warmer. Being outside the apartment cleared my head in a minute. This was way, way worse than the EL game where a hardback chair and a seat by the open window fixed the problem.)<br/><br/>Ran Kereberos II: Machinery of Life, where folks teased about whether there'd be actual actiony plot. I had prepared a few things, but one of the minor ones didn't happen for at least an hour, which was Not My Doing, as I mentioned it a few times. This is fine -- I'm quite used to the Kerbereans going off on tangents, but for the record, this was Not My Doing.<br/><br/>I also had maps to show folks likely routes to get from point A to point B, resulting in:<br/><br/>1. One player expressing bogglement at this laminated paper that was not a touch screen. (Yes, he was joking. He knows I used to work at Hagstrom.)<br/><br/>2. Looking up when the Suez Canal was constructed. In game time, it's still under construction.<br/><br/>3. Wondering at the state of railroads in various countries.<br/><br/>4. Reminding me that it's not just my sense of scale that's off when it comes to India, but also that the map I was using had some extra countries that did not exist in the mid-19th century.<br/><br/>We also had terrible jokes based on previous silliness. In the first Kerberos game, we established that there were living daguerreotypes, known as fleople. There had been one for each of the PCs, causing some confusion as the doubles -- naturally -- committed crimes. That was all cleared up, and the fleople were now integrated into Paris society. One of them had a cat who was still around.<br/><br/>PC: So, Flartin is fline?<br/><br/>Me: Yes, Flartin is fline. He has flittens!<br/><br/>The doctor was fascinated by how the fleople worked, and explained that a) they are two dimensional, sure, but still have mass, and b) one basically operates by reaching into another dimension.<br/><br/>PC: Wait, do the fleople have flillnesses?<br/><br/>Another PC: Of course -- they have the flu!<br/><br/>Folks still did shopping and tourism, and visited various cathedrals and Restaurant Laperouse (and the player introducing it sent a link that mentioned the fascinating French laws about adultery, and told us about ortolans), of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461531/#Comment_461531" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-30T17:07:15+00:00" title="March 30, 2017  5:07PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran a playtest of <b>The Urban Fantasy Hack</b>.

Eventually, I'll put that up for sale on DriveThruRPG.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty" title="frenzykitty"><img alt="frenzykitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/557/n6V5J0A17A1B2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty">frenzykitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461556/#Comment_461556" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-31T21:18:01+00:00" title="March 31, 2017  9:18PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played one of the final playtests of my new game KARMA which I am launching in May <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461557/#Comment_461557" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-31T21:41:07+00:00" title="March 31, 2017  9:41PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461647/#Comment_461647" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T04:06:13+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  4:06AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2017 10:05PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played Montsegur 1244 last week (I think it would've worked better if everyone attempted a more somber tone).

We've got two kids who are bonding because they were both witness to a murder, a pool that can give you visions of the past, and a creepy janitor who, in his youth, made a seminal indie film. On top of that, it turns out our Werewolf has a copy of the master key, opening any room in the school. That's surely not good to lead anywhere good...<br/><br/>Two of the PCs are former flames, who promised to each other they'd be together forever. However, it turns out that one of them meant it when he said it. The other... only said it because she didn't think she'd ever actually see him again. Now, a few years later, they unexpectedly find themselves at the same school. Tragic!<br/><br/>The only drawback is that we ended up with two characters who are social outcasts, and then third player decided his character was "the new kid in town"... which makes giving them a stake in school affairs difficult.

Caroline is politely avoiding mentioning that her character's story goal was to use "gestation meditation" to hack his teenage daughter's pregnancy, whether she likes it or not. Yep, that's right: it's not just the mother that can do it. Little circles of people can hover around a pregnant woman and alter the baby's genetic makeup. And everybody's doing it.<br/><br/>I also played a <b>Kingdom</b> game where our community was a remote, 19th century Nordic whaling town. We were caught between our old traditions and superstitions and the modern influences of the Company that built a monstrous new flensing building smack in the middle of the docks. Everyone else was new to Kingdom and most were total strangers, but as the pot started to simmer the conflicts and interpersonal drama got wonderfully intense. We played until the store kicked us out and then stood around shaking hands and congratulating each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461857/#Comment_461857" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-10T20:10:25+00:00" title="April 10, 2017  8:10PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtested Fate of Cthulhu and hit the bumps we expected to hit, so we now have data to send Evil Hat.

Shadow Hunters was amazing but it outstayed its welcome pretty close to the end of the second session. Imperial, I don't like it. I even suggested it because I had forgotten how much I dislike it. For my taste, extremely kingmaker:y and political games can't be long or brainburn:y/calculate:y, and Imperial is both. In my group the slang term for such games are "Unos", because the card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_%28card_game%29" rel="nofollow">Uno</a> is kingmakery and political game that is very breezy and mindless and something I don't really get worked up about and thus don't mind playing. And once I said about some big political thinky AT game "Ugh, four hours and that much brain usage is a bit much for an Uno" and it stuck. So ironically "Uno"-games now in our extremely local jargon are long and brainburny games with more than two teams. (So, <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shudan" rel="nofollow">\u624b\u8c08</a> is not an "Uno" because it has only two teams and thus the long hours spent thinking isn't effed up by a third party.)<br/><br/>Don't worry I don't plan on writing about every board game I play (Pandemic Legacy was an exception because it's also a story game).

My apologies if it is not.), one leader who's worked with the governor of Bombay in the past sent an embassy through proposing an alliance for similar situations (fighting off undead hordes), but only one person got through, and he was mortally wounded -- well, it would've been mortal if Dr. Alexander hadn't been there.<br/><br/>Anyway, the governor sent the PCs to escort the survivor and his own man to the leader, as he's not certain this is a legitimate offer, but would like to build bridges. En route, a British colonel intercepted them, gave them quarters for the evening, and offered to escort them.<br/><br/>Naturally, this was a trap, as he'd made a horrible mistake attacking the embassy, assuming that these folks were obviously making trouble, and so he came up with the kind of plan that the Jaegermonsters in Girl Genius deconstructed (<a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20031017#.WPbntme1ty0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20031017#.WPbntme1ty0</a>): "Dis is turnink into one of DOSE plans... de kind vere ve kill everyone dot notices dot ve's killin' people?"<br/><br/>Obviously, he had to kill the PCs and the folks they were traveling with to keep this from getting out.<br/><br/>So, obviously, the PCs made short work of this plan.<br/>Ladon, the quiet middle class plant mage, made stairs explode with roots as there was no way anyone was murdering his wife and kids, thank you.<br/>Felicity turned into a clockwork angel again, getting the vast majority of the soldiers to surrender as she was an agent of Queen Victoria (and this is the point in Kerberos where folks stop praying for her and start praying to her...)<br/>Dorian tried to convince soldiers inside the building that orders had changed, and although deceit is his specialty, I rolled a +4 on Fudge / Fate dice, so obviously, these were the most trusted of the colonel's men. So, Dorian stabbed one, got dragged off to the colonel, made the colonel think that Dorian was offering to disguise himself as the colonel so the colonel would get away, slit the colonel's throat from behind, managed to not get shot by the soldiers, and looked at the tableaux of the dead thinking, "Blast it, I should have tried to get the colonel to shoot himself first. That would have been more artistic, and I could always have slit his throat later if that didn't work!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462127/#Comment_462127" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-19T04:57:03+00:00" title="April 19, 2017  4:57AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing my own stuff this week, due to <i>Monsterhearts</i> getting postponed. <br/><br/>Continuing playtesting on <i>Inconceivable</i>, the Princess Bride-inspired collaborative RPG, and had a really unusually "hot" session of <i>Musette</i> with random non-gamers, which I wrote up here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21066/the-best-things-in-gaming-a-real-time-illustrator" rel="nofollow">The Best Things in Gaming: a Real-Life Illustrator</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PatrickRBG" title="PatrickRBG"><img alt="PatrickRBG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PatrickRBG">PatrickRBG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462144/#Comment_462144" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-19T19:07:24+00:00" title="April 19, 2017  7:07PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am running the pathfinder adventure path called Strange Aeons.

It is owned and operated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and serves as both a veteran\u2019s home and gerontology research facility.

During active service they were exposed to high concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in firefighting foam and aircraft hydraulic fluid. Numerous longitudinal studies are underway documenting the effects of PFOS exposure over the resident\u2019s lifetimes.

With the variant rules we played with, I think it was important to use some restraint when employing the mechanic. In one story the mechanic was basically used to demolish another's character in every scene...their was no real tension and no real conflict, and it just made for a bad frustrating story. In the other story the players lost interest in the mechanic; I think it was due to a learning curve issue and some misunderstanding of the rules...we just weren't able to use it, in a consistent enough way, to improve the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462459/#Comment_462459" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-25T20:53:34+00:00" title="April 25, 2017  8:53PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2017 8:54PM by Felan.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran the conclusion - the denouement/epilogue, really - to a seven-year continuous campaign that began in D&amp;D 3.5 and was immediately switched to Pathfinder. After running two D&amp;D modules (A Dark and Stormy Knight, The Sunless Citadel), we played through the Pathfinder Adventure Path The Council of Thieves. After that, we went off book to continue the story, along the way switching first temporarily, then permanently, to Dungeon World. The previous session was the epic climax, in which they finally unseated the oppressive House Thrune, effectively liberating Cheliax.<br/><br/>It's tough to wrap up such a convoluted story, but I prepared a non-linear set of free-form vignettes (no dice rolling) wrapping up loose ends and projecting character arcs into the future (and the past), framing most of them around questions like "Does Tash ever retire from adventuring? If so, what does he do after?" and it worked really well. We closed on the last time the whole party was together, at a impromptu reunion ten years later, fading to black as they shared news, rehashed old arguments, and told tall tales about the old days.<br/><br/>This was by far the longest campaign I've ever been a part of, and an important part of my life, so I was really pleased that we gave it a proper send-off.

PF to DW was obviously more drastic. At first it was temporary, just for fun, so we used the pre-existing DW classes, but when we switched permanently, I did more granular re-creations of each character using Class Warfare. By the time we switched, we had been playing for years, and we knew the characters very well, so it was pretty organic. The biggest change was the Sorcerer who became the (slightly broken) Mage class, meaning he wasn't limited to a predetermined list of spells, which created all kinds of wild situations.<br/><br/>I didn't chronicle my own switch, but <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17810/converting-your-game-to-a-new-system" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> was very helpful as I wrapped my head around the process!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462514/#Comment_462514" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T20:44:22+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  8:44PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Thanks, great thread</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462524/#Comment_462524" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T13:41:36+00:00" title="April 27, 2017  1:41PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More <i>Everway</i>-mashup.

(This isn't a requirement, but it's a whole lot o'fun!) This session took place, we decided, two years after the last. Eight / Kate-Present loves her job -- which is working for a company that will contribute to the destruction of humanity -- and her boyfriend, who got her that job, is now cheerfully making bombs in the basement, explaining that he couldn't handle his iPhone and now we have AIs running for president? As they flew to Switzerland:<br/><br/>Sydney: I don't understand what you're doing any more Eight -- I almost wish you still worked in the Hot Topic!<br/><br/>Eight / Kate-Present: You used to be so stable -- an island of Sanity!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jule, the androgynous child of the future whose programming was tweaked by Kate-future was angsting and oh yes, was enjoying childhood so much that they hadn't aged in the last two years.<br/><br/>Jule: Can we save the world now so I can go back to playing Pokemon?<br/><br/>Kate-Future poked her head into the room in the resort where Kate-Present and Sydney were actually working out their relationship.<br/><br/>Kate-Present: What are you doing here?<br/><br/>Sydney: We're going to be getting relationship counseling and see about having a baby -- what about you?<br/><br/>Kate-Future to Samson, the rebellious Deep One Hybrid: They are completely insane and must be stopped. Also, we must destroy the artificial womb.<br/><br/>Sydney's Player: That's an addendum.<br/><br/>Kate-Present's player decided that one of her Aspects was "I have more Artificial Friends than real ones", one of whom was Triple 8. Kate-Future had created 9. Nope, no rivalry, why would you think that, and anyway go away while I beat her score at MindQuake!<br/><br/>Jule: I hate Nine!<br/><br/>Kate-Future: What? Why?<br/><br/>Jule: You like Nine more than you like me!<br/><br/>Kate-Future: What? Nine can't replace you!<br/><br/>Jule (not mollified): Fine!<br/><br/>Jule had met Jule's... er, future future self, and was conflicted because, sure, Kate-Future hadn't killed Jule and had tweaked Jule's programming, but what about the other kids from the artificial wombs?<br/><br/>Kate-Future: No I only reprogram you -- I love you so much.<br/><br/>Jule: But what about the railgun?<br/><br/>Kate-Future: I could never love a railgun as much as I love you!<br/><br/>Samson: This is doing nothing to un-disillusion me about the nature of familial relationships!<br/><br/>Alas, Samson had been taking advantage of the fact that folks believed Dr. Kate Octavian (future) was Kate McKinnon (and we figured Kate McKinnon plays her in the movie, so is impersonating herself) and that Samson was her sperm donor and tried to get close to him as sort of, um, proxy getting close to her, so as the final conflict played out -- PCs fighting each other about whether to destroy the AI in charge of the Artificial Womb Project -- his son showed up from the future. He just needs to make his dad BELIEVE in the power of Dagon!<br/><br/>Yeah, Sydney decked him because he was bothering Samson, and he has a relationship aspect with Samson: Samson is my tenant and a good tenant is hard to find. (He was mortified to discover that this kid was Samson's son.)<br/><br/>Actually, Kate-Future and Jule are also Samson's tenants, and Kate's relationship aspect is: We're not pretty, but we're family!<br/><br/>Jule took a moderate consequence: The AI Dr. Miller IS my mother!<br/><br/>Kate-Future's player: So you've entered the You're Not My Mom! phase!<br/><br/>Yeah, basically. Eventually, a compromise was worked out. Kate-Present was allowed to back up her friend, the AI Dr. Miller (Hey, she's in the same book club as Kate-Present) to a zetabyte drive, while Kate-Future overwrote the original with Nine and insisted to Jule that everyone was synthetic, not just Jule.<br/><br/>Samson: Oh, in the Hegelian sense.<br/><br/>And that is the last scheduled session during playtest time, but we're likely to continue the game. Next session, we figure, should take place five to seven years later, and Kate-Present and Sydney and their child will go to Lemuria -- the original version of, well, it's like Jurassic Park, but a franchise, and... I didn't know tyrannosauruses had tentacles...<br/><br/>My entire prep work for this session:<br/>Rereading a few of the playtest rules<br/>Rereading the NPC rules from Fate Core<br/>And:<br/><br/>Dr. Miller's Resort<br/>Aspect: Overlooking a lake<br/>Aspect: 2 hours drive from Zurich<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462564/#Comment_462564" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T08:25:33+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:25AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lisa, you have some talented players!\n<blockquote>I didn't know tyrannosauruses had tentacles...</blockquote>\n<a href="https://xkcd.com/1747/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/spider_paleontology.png"/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462623/#Comment_462623" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T23:05:52+00:00" title="April 28, 2017 11:05PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night at Story Games Seattle we played Fiasco, Follow, Fall of Magic and Firebrands.

We had a blast. The combat system creates this fog of war feeling, the players constant attack the same target and have to find a way to divide up the fight before other targets overwhelm them. It took a bit of time to get used to the terminology of the game, but we got there in the end.<br/><br/>We spent about an hour building characters, half an hour working out all the backstory and interpersonal stuff, and got a solid three hours of play. We had a fantastic moment where our mild mannered, semi-famous trivia master(also a werewolf) decided to transform and risk the normal humans on the train putting it up on youtube. Going toe to toe with the bad guy, they\u200b were able to get into\u200b a sweet momentum of countering moves and set up their teammate, a scared warrior type character, to finish the baddie off with enough damage to cause instant death.<br/><br/>Would Recommend!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p7">7</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-12 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p12">12</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20918%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20918%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What did you play this week?

The dragon was some kind of Tremors-esque giant burrowing worm that turned out to be a gnomish mechanical mining machine run amok. We defeated it by trapping it in a large cavern and causing it to collide with itself, just like in Snake. Both my characters died ignominious deaths along the way, it was great.

I used Vicious Mockery to force the boss of this week's dungeon to give up on life.<br/><br/>An ongoing online game of <b>Blades in the Dark</b> focused on the efforts of a crew of gun runners selling, conniving, and committing brazen acts of violence to keep Charhallow safe from other criminals and to raise in power. We ended with a cliffhanger involving a 3 way confrontation that will most likely result in our crew going to war with at least one other faction if we survive. We might just pull a rabbit out of our collective hats if we do not all stress out first. <br/><br/>I play <b>Candros Slane, The Little Sparrow</b> - A Former Imperial Sniper and Master Manipulator.

He is a mix of Hound and Slide.<br/><br/>This week I will play Blades in the Dark and an in person V20 Dark Ages game (Giovanni Chronicles) where I play <b>Ignacio Valdez</b>, a 300+ year old Brujah political dissident, duelist, and Archon of the Camarilla <i>for now</i>.<br/><br/>Hopefully soon I can start running some Apocalypse World, Masks, Exalted 3e, or Chronicles of Darkness.

This week's Realm featured some excessive bureaucracy which a player jokingly likened to a certain portion of the Don't Rest Your Head setting, and a system of prevention of violent crime by the preemptive suppression of individuals possessing the physical strength to become dangerous criminals. Little gods who inhabit underground water springs really are sneaky, dangerous bastards, apparently, and our favorite such little bastard, Acheron, managed to break free. Stuff happened which tested the limits of my current character growth subsystems, demonstrating they're flexible enough: one spherewalker recruited armed followers (a bunch of them, but quite inept), one was forced to drastically re-skin an existing power (I'm not traveling with Acheron any more, but it looks like I got another little goddess to carry around), and one fell ill (that's quite a character development, trust me).<br/><br/>Also, <i>Fiasco</i>, with Giulia Barbano &amp; Renato Ramonda's <i>De' Medici playset.</i> I suppose actually living in Florence gives you a special relationship of a sort with that playset...

Experimenting with different approaches to handling dungeons, from old school map-as-you-go to node-based diagram to pure theater of the mind. My main focus right now is trying to find a structure for improvising dungeons on the fly that is easy to use and integrates well with the "Venture Forth" move we're using to handle overland and underground exploration. Players are enjoying the game, especially exploring the world that they established in the first session, but all of the necessary experimentation on my end has resulted in me not really being able to get in a groove.<br/><br/>The other issue is that after a few side-sessions of <i>GenLab Alpha</i>, my sense is that they're hankering to play characters motivated by more than loot acquisition. The GenLab setup is that the PCs are post-apoc human/animal hybrid members of a resistance seeking to overthrow their robot overseers, which makes the players instantly more invested in the proceedings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463067/#Comment_463067" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T08:33:22+00:00" title="May  7, 2017  8:33AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Firebrands, Session 3.

GMing takes a lot out of me and I want to start working on minimizing the time I spend talking and controlling the narration duties.<br/><br/>First was the penultimate session of the first season of our very first <b> Burning Wheel </b> game!  It's sort of an Iron Age Celtic high fantasy vibe and the characters are in the midst of their first large scale battle, which is racking up quite the death toll.  I'm using a simple, hacked-together " tides of war" resolution system that the players can push into their favor by taking actions that have a significant impact on the flow of battle.  <br/><br/>We played a bit slowly and timidly as we were learning the game and the players had been unusually successful up to this point, so the deaths of a lot of significant characters hit pretty hard.  It felt like our own version of the Red Wedding.  It was awesome <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Next was the first session of the new game of <b> Apocalypse World </b> and boy, is it going to get weird!  We've got a brainer, a savvy head, a child thing and a hard holder named Ol' Dirty, who pilots a Howl's Moving Castle-esque land train across the wasteland, chasing massive psychic storms called Whalestroms that frequently leave imprints on the world from another time or place, altering landscapes or producing strange artifacts.  And yep, you guessed it, sky whales. <br/><br/>The players are fairly new and extremely creative so it's possible that I should have reined them in a bit, but I'm excited to see where this goes!  At the very least, I'll get a lot of practice writing custom moves!<br/><br/>And lastly, just finished up with the second episode of Tales of the Four Nations, a <b> Legends of the Elements </b> campaign within the Avatar: the Last Airbender universe, set about 20 years before the events of the show. <br/><br/>Things have been moving a little slow, two of the players are brand new to RPGs and we're still getting the hang of pacing, as well as applying and taking advantage of Tags, narrative descriptors that mechanically incentivize players to think about fictional positioning and the effectiveness of teamwork.  But it's one of the most fun groups have ever played with and we're having a blast. There's been a lot of laughter and the moves are definitely pushing us towards interesting and thematically appropriate situations. Plus I'm getting to geek out in one of my favorite fictional universes...  no complaints here <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>EDIT: haha! just noticed that <a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a> posted right before me! hey Max! killer game man, we're really enjoying it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463133/#Comment_463133" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T08:00:39+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  8:00AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More <i>Everway</i>-hack.

The forest the villagers were afraid of going to was home to dual-spirited individuals (some of them villagers turning into animals, some of them... other things) who welcomed Merry as one of their own, but Merry was scared - afraid of becoming Brother entirely, his own consciousness vanishing forever.

After only GM:ing for what feels like years, it was odd to be on the other side of the table.<br/><br/>The failing Hamilton franchise of Ghostbusters, run by the hapless Gene Yorke, had laid off most of their staff, leaving only three busters to manage the business.<br/><br/>After a rather depressing conference call with the other franchises in the region, we learn that Gene's rival in Toronto is once again leading the region in profitability and captures. Gene then informed us he is heading out of town for a ' family obligation' and would be back a week, leaving the operation was in our hands.<br/><br/>Our first call came early in the day and sent us to a high school. A ghost had an office administrator trapped in the washroom. Trapped in the sense that they didn't want to walk through the shin deep foamy ooze covering the floor. Slip and slide hilarity ensued, but the ghost was successfully trapped.<br/><br/>On our way back from the call, we came across more and more instances of the same ghosty behaviour and after following the trail of destruction(disruption at best) we came upon the source, a coffee shop unknowingly serving haunted coffee.<br/><br/>The GM really did a great job of keeping it fun and light, while being just challenging enough to keep us guessing. And the system was super lean, but very enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs" title="Caroline_Hobbs"><img alt="Caroline_Hobbs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/121/nILD1Q33E03N4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">Caroline_Hobbs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463276/#Comment_463276" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-11T20:40:39+00:00" title="May 11, 2017  8:40PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played <b>Love in the Time of Seid</b>!

Silly folks.<br/><br/>I figured that the winning side (won on account of the PC who technically ruled the other side abdicated in exchange for a promise that kept all the fae out of town) would start executing their enemies, one of whom, obviously, would run to the PCs for help, which... threatens to make the bargain that keeps the fae out of town and not at war null and void.<br/><br/>So, the Queen figured that the obvious way to fix this was not to hand the fugitive over but to take over the fae realm herself. The Werewolf agreed to help, and it was obvious they'd have to talk to the Witch, as he's a random factor. Logically, they should NOT talk to the Fae, who wants to be left out of it, but we didn't want to leave a player out of it.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the Fae and the Queen have had sex, which means the Fae counts as part of the Queen's gang, which means that the Streaming move can work both ways -- I treated this as Roll +Dark, you get the information regardless, but the roll's result tells us if something else goes horribly wrong. So, everyone's on board with this horrible, horrible, delightful plan.<br/><br/>Some of the negotiations came about from the Queen dragging the Werewolf into the girls' bathroom.<br/><br/>Queen: You're a girl, sort of. I'm a girl, sort of.<br/><br/>The Witch's father thinks the Witch is utterly evil and powerhungry. The Witch's mother thinks the Witch's father is psychotic and dangerous. The Witch has finally managed to undo one of his hexes, the one damaging his father for lying, and has not yet tried to undo the hex that keeps his father from speaking (creating a new hex, the Vampire's hypnosis, but with +Dark).<br/><br/>The Fae was astonished that their girlfriend continued to stay angry even after they got her flowers, so arranged for her to take magic ice cream that would make her more forgiving. They are now wondering if that was a bad idea, as the girlfriend is taking this forgiving thing pretty far.<br/><br/>And, out of character at least, possibly in character for one or two of the PCs, they're remembering a little detail... So, the reason the Witch's grandmother made a generational deal with the fae, a deal which might be or become null and void? To protect the town from demons...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463300/#Comment_463300" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T23:10:03+00:00" title="May 12, 2017 11:10PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Big myth <b>Microscope</b> at Story Games Seattle.<br/><br/>All the gods and animals come together to carve the All-Rune into the golden sun that lights our hollow earth, but later in the game we find out that wasn't their first attempt.

So I decided to run the gamma playtest of the weeks where they were absent.<br/><br/>The pitch session is where the players define the setting/adventure and make their characters. They decided that they wanted to fight Nazi/KGB Vampires called "the Red Menace", and that the Red Menace is ultimately an outgrowth of the Kroll'x alien invaders. Now one thing about having the players having such a heavy hand in the creation of the adventure is that it wiped away some of the surprise, so I decided to see if I could create some surprises. <br/><br/>The game was to be set in Florida. I decided a way to tie Nazis, the KGB, and Vampires together is by having Nazis fleeing to South America stumble upon Kroll'x outposts that existed in mesoamerica (and thus Meso-American blood cult themed vampires); this in turn gets stumbled upon by KGB agents assisting communist uprisings in the region, which ultimately spreads to Florida. The final piece that ties this together is that there is rumor that a Nazi war criminal named Klaus Barbie was used by the CIA to help hunt down Che Guevara, a Marxist revolutionary active in Latin America. So you know where I am going with this: the main villain is Vampire Che.<br/><br/>Anyways, part of the pitch session is collaboratively making a bunch of NPCs, Each player makes 3 names, and then the cards get passed left twice, and each player adds one element to each NPC. This has the effect of creating a lot of flavorful NPCs the GM can pull into the game, full of interesting quirks and story hooks. They had this element in the beta and it astonished me how useful this was to the GM.<br/><br/>The gamma adds to this process. After each NPC has two elements, you pile them in the middle of the table, then each player gets the chance to add an element to one of the NPCs and promote it to a villain. We'll see how this works out. It promises to take me different directions than I might have gone if I was making the villains from scratch.<br/><br/>Finally the PCs. They made:<br/><b>Rex Power</b>, a Cyborg Assassin, escaped from a secret government program (the same player played the character in the Beta playtest and remade him here.)<br/><b>William Ashford III</b>, member of a secret cabal of wizards being hunted by an order called the Knights Templar.<br/><b>Johnny Pickle</b>, garbage-man from a secret order of garbage-men who hunt cultists they discover by remnants they leave behind.<br/><br/>This promises to be interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ichthyarch" title="Ichthyarch"><img alt="Ichthyarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/016/n4MMEWQ2ZI7MC.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ichthyarch">Ichthyarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463363/#Comment_463363" name="Item_237" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-15T20:34:40+00:00" title="May 15, 2017  8:34PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not this week but the week before, I played Microscope at Boise Public Library.

Which didn't stop him from walking the spheres, but gave him a home to head back to. The bride, already carrying a child, has stayed back... but the bridesmaids, warrior women all of them, have joined us. And, as it happens, we found our way back to the realm the groom is from...<br/><br/>A slave population toils endlessly in a post-apocalyptic desert, under the inhumanly cruel, exceedingly decadent rule of the "Angels" - a race of magical bird-women inhabiting impossibly opulent flying citadels, and served by dragons. Not much has changed since the failed revolt Free led years ago.<br/>The twist is, Angels appear to be scheming against each other for more power. This might explain how the Fool, reversed ("lack of connection") can occupy the Virtue slot in the oracle of the realm: that's the weak spot of the evil rulers. Or maybe it refers to how there are no Gates in the realm, except for the one Free left through - possibly formed or opened by the very blood of the dragon he slew in his escape - and we've now used to come back... A Gate the Angels are intrigued by, and extremely interested in. So much, in fact, that because of our expertise with the Gates they've been treating us as their guests, so far...<br/>Their hospitality is much creepier than their hostility, believe me. Also, as we'd very wisely split the party, we're now separated and the guests of two different Angel citadels, each ruled by a self-styled Goddess-Empress of the Whole Universe.<br/>Finally, Free has been haunted by visions of his long-presumed-dead former lover, appearing to him as a live woman, though only from a distance. At least one of the Angels, apparently scheming behind the back of her own queen, knows, and is using this leverage to manipulate Free-of-Chains into helping her...<br/><br/>And that's our cliffhanger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463465/#Comment_463465" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T23:03:32+00:00" title="May 19, 2017 11:03PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played <b>Fiasco</b> (Game of Thrones playset) the day before last.

My friends were drunk this time, so the story wasn't as good, and the drunkenness was a bit annoying since I don't drink; but everything considered, it went pretty well. Yesterday, Story Games Salt Lake City play <b>Follow</b>. We play the Colony quest.  We were basically trying to set up a colony on a hostile planet with other creatures that were somewhat comical and hostile. The game was silly and I don't think the tone served the story well. I think in order to get the best out of Follow, groups should discuss what kind of tone to get everyone on the same page.  Of course, this is important with any story game, but I feel it helps especially in Follow. I also think it's best to stick closely to the archetypal story (in terms of structure) of the quest your playing because the game tends to go in interesting directions on its own and if you push too hard you can get into a space that loses its verisimilitude                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463466/#Comment_463466" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-20T01:20:10+00:00" title="May 20, 2017  1:20AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played <b>Something to Hide</b> at Story Games Seattle, which I've been wanting to try for a while.

I hacked the game to bits and came up with this:<br/><br/>The setting was Depression-era Arkansas, and the characters were entirely mundane, human, people. (Not teenage monsters, in other words.)<br/><br/>But as the game progressed, they experienced otherworldly forces and gradually were transformed into something rather alien and/or monstrous. In the end, it seems, alien forces were trying to make their way onto the Earth, slowly infesting humans with inexorable purpose.<br/><br/>In our playthrough, it's pretty clear that they succeeded.<br/><br/>I should write this up sometime to share the mechanics bits and pieces - they are a lot of fun. The only regret was that we didn't have longer to stretch out the game and explore the ramifications piece by piece. (Particularly the character transformations which took place.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463507/#Comment_463507" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-22T01:19:19+00:00" title="May 22, 2017  1:19AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Confession: I am much more of an action/adventure/espionage GM than a horror GM. But the way my players are littering the landscape with the corpses of conspiracy goons in my <b>Nights Black Agents</b> game was wearing a little thin. The <i>Coldfall House</i> nugget seemed moody, and I wanted to set the PCs on the course for a big confrontation with the <i>Satanic Cult of Dracula</i>. So I set the Coldfall House hook and played it up for all the eerie horror effects I could mustered, and eventually set the steely-eyed agents running.

Not much has changed since the failed revolt Free led years ago.<br/>The twist is, Angels appear to be scheming against each other for more power. This might explain how the Fool, reversed ("lack of connection") can occupy the Virtue slot in the oracle of the realm: that's the weak spot of the evil rulers. Or maybe it refers to how there are no Gates in the realm, except for the one Free left through - possibly formed or opened by the very blood of the dragon he slew in his escape - and we've now used to come back... A Gate the Angels are intrigued by, and extremely interested in. So much, in fact, that because of our expertise with the Gates they've been treating us as their guests, so far...<br/>Their hospitality is much creepier than their hostility, believe me. Also, as we'd very wisely split the party, we're now separated and the guests of two different Angel citadels, each ruled by a self-styled Goddess-Empress of the Whole Universe.<br/>Finally, Free has been haunted by visions of his long-presumed-dead former lover, appearing to him as a live woman, though only from a distance. At least one of the Angels, apparently scheming behind the back of her own queen, knows, and is using this leverage to manipulate Free-of-Chains into helping her...<br/><br/>And that's our cliffhanger.</p></div></blockquote>\nMaybe we didn't save the world, but we managed to kick quite a lot of Angel-ass at least! My character All-Reading Ink and Free-from-Chains each, separately, managed to release a powerful dragon from indenture to the Angels: they went spread havoc and wrecked a couple flying citadels. Then Free released a <i>third</i> dragon, basically starting a draconic uprise...<br/><br/>Oh, yeah: the mystery woman from the past... Turns out she was actually the <i>ghost</i> of Free's lover of old, animated by dragon blood spilled on her fresh corpse. As Free lied severely wounded, near death in a falling sky-citadel (this was after physically wrestling the first dragon into freedom) the ghost bound with him, healing his bodily wounds in the process, to forever haunt his mind with memories hereafter.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, it was demonstrated that Merry's demonic double Brother isn't willing to manifest anymore. Can this mean Merry is dying? He sure feels his time's running short.<br/><br/>Anyway, war broke out between various Angel queens (we counted fourteen of those) for ownership of the gate, and we had to hold it for days and weeks against all comers - Free riding dragons and kicking ass - while Merry basically ferried away a whole village's population through the gate to some sphere on the other side. I personally enjoyed the pleasure of beheading one of the Angel queens with my axe. Can you imagine more effective a way to counter a mind-control spell? Meanwhile, human rebels stole dragon eggs from the crashed citadels... Thus, the seeds of a rebellion that might have a shot at succeeding have been planted.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463548/#Comment_463548" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-25T04:13:10+00:00" title="May 25, 2017  4:13AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of PbtA lately:<br/><br/>MCing <i>Monsterhearts</i>, third session of a new campaign.

Answer: well past the point of sanity, but not quite past the point of no return. And, in fact, in the closing coda, one of the PCs finally decided to return home, despite her distaste at signing a loyalty oath in just-post-McCarthy-era USA.

The nature of the Threats is sort of window dressing, so they're starting to feel repetitive.

The game definitely has a lot of mechanics and procedural elements for story game. The challenge scenes we're not as drawn out narratively or as interesting as I would've liked. The social scenes were also lacking; I was the only one who rolled dice to generate a prompt for my social scenes, and I would have liked to see the other players give the mechanic a try. The players also agreed on tone but this lasted all of fifteen minutes. I'm going to split the groups up by tone because players who have been trying to get a more serious, dark game have been frustrated by those introducing a lot of silly, whimsical story elements. So we'll see how dividing the groups up by tone works. I would like to try Preserverant again; I don't think we got everything out of it we could.

A great ending.<br/><br/>The adventure itself was a mixture of refugee crisis and haunted/faerie woods, with humans as pawns in the competition between local "little gods" and the workable solution hinging on reforming local religion (which of course we did). There was collateral damage, including a beloved NPC being turned into a flower.<br/><br/>Now, we'd started the session under some pressure to get to an ending, because over the previous two adventures Free's position had become untenable as a sphere-wandering character, having developed duties both as a husband and father in a realm and as a military leader to a whole exiled people elsewhere. But getting to a full resolution required Merry's issue - of sharing a body with the powerful, dangerous Brother and not having enough life-force left to sustain the both of them - to be resolved somehow. Attachment to Merry had gradually grown to be my character Ink's main issue, his aim as a wizard having long been to grow powerful enough to somehow separate Merry and Brother, or otherwise save Merry's life while not sabotaging his original mission (of containing Brother so it won't kill people).<br/><br/>The twist in this particular session was that, as a side-effect of various powers the enchanted woods had, Barbara arranged for Ink to be able to <i>speak</i> to Brother at last - an actual spoken conversation. While the conversation didn't actually reveal anything we didn't already know as players, it was an emotional turning point, putting great pressure on me, as Ink, to take immediate action to save the Merry-Brother dual being from themselves. Still, my <i>means</i> of doing so hadn't improved from previous sessions - at first I felt stuck, in need of a deus ex machina. In fact, a fresh look at the assets we already had was all was needed.<br/><br/>Now, I'm really satisfied with the game system I've designed, because as we entered the crisis-resolution segment of the session I still had no idea what to do. It really was the interplay of cards on the table to push me into hard choices and finally inspired me to go for a Gordian solution: Ink magically remade himself into a vessel for Brother, with help from Free (who has a permanent power to free prisoners from their magical constraints) separated Brother and Merry, and absorbed Brother. Then, Ink remained in the faerie woods, where Brother couldn't do any harm - Merry chose to stay with him.<br/><br/>Nothing of the above was planned before being pulled off, and getting there required me, as Ink, to make some really hard choices: choosing to retain my knowledge of magic over retaining my freedom and choosing to save Merry's life over saving Onyx's (the recurring NPC who'd become Ink's lover). This was especially agonizing, and I cried for Onyx a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463701/#Comment_463701" name="Item_270" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T21:11:25+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  9:11PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trifecta week again:<br/><br/><b>Night's Black Agents</b> - In my <i>Dracula Dossier </i>game, during the Coldfall House scenario (previously described), the players said they looked for news reports in the areas, so amongst the other clues, I dropped in a clue about an old man who was found wandering the woods. This  might have sounded like a typical "lost elderly man" scenario, but in truth, it was an "Cushing", one of the annotators of the Dracula Dossier and an old MI6 spy involved in a Dracula-related mole hunt. They players find him and find out that his daughter has been mind controlled into injecting him with a strange substance that are costing him his health and lucidity.<br/><br/>So they kidnap him.<br/><br/>On the bright side, once they cured him of the serum he was being injected with, he was a trove of clues about the mole hunt. On the down side, now I have to come up with the facts behind the mole hunt. (On the other bright side, after a long string of "what conspiracy related asset are we going to whack this week", it sounds like an authentic mystery the players might be intrigued by again.)<br/><br/><b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> - Though I wasn't sure my adventure ideas were fully formed, I decided to "pull the trigger" on an adventure I have been brewing for a few weeks. An villain that has intrigued me was called <i>Dollface</i> from the threat report book, an MCU-Ultron style self-replicating robot. Dollface is less about world domination than she is about play-acting. Though this is rife with possibilities, I wasn't sure what to actually do here. But the first thing that occurred to me here was one I have seen show up a few times in televised media: a wild west simulation (see "Westworld", the Star Trek episode "Specter of the Gun", and the Red Dwarf episode "Gunmen of the Apocalypse".)<br/><br/>So I constructed a scenario in which the Sheriff in a small rural county appeals to the Big City Supers Team[TM] for help when two deputies disappear in a ghost town, and subsequent investigation reveals what appears to be a ghost town plucked out of time in a barrier that shuts down all advanced tech. Though it is made to look like some weird time displacement phenomenon, it was actually an advanced ruse where Dollface is playing out an old western story to the tune of "Shane", "The Magnificent Seven", and "Pale Rider".<br/><br/>Overall, it went swimmingly, in no small part because it was not the sort of "villain of the week threatens the city" fare that my players were expecting. They figured out if they played along with the story Dollface was laying out, the could figure out what was going on. They learned a bit more about what Dollface is, and she/it will be back in the future.<br/><br/><b>Pathfinder</b> - I'm trying to draw my Razor Coast stuff down so I can return to the main continent where I have been brewing some ideas for the players. In the prior session, the PCs found what they came to the island for, but found out the mage who was supposed to teleport them home is MIA (which is a central mystery of upcoming adventures), so they have to wait for a boat to arrive to take them home.<br/><br/>So they did some odd jobs, so I decide to pull one of the best backstory bits to the fore before we leave the Razor Coast setting. They get hired to investigate why a lighthouse has went dark, but the first mate of the ship they hired to get them to the island offers the PCs a little extra if they can look for signs of the Razor's Edge, the ship that belonged to the captain lover. The first mate thinks that something smells wrong about the popular story about how Jacob Razor died.<br/><br/>And of course, he is correct. After the typical dungeon crawl stuff with the lighthouse, the players find the wreck of the Razor's Edge and the ghost of Jacob Razor, and learn of his tragic betrayal.<br/><br/>The Razor Coast campaign, as written, goes on much longer than this. But I plan on cobbling together a few adventure for our exciting finale next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463702/#Comment_463702" name="Item_271" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-04T21:32:31+00:00" title="June  4, 2017  9:32PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played Seth Ben-Ezra's <i>Showdown</i> for the first time earlier today.

And that did happen, sure.<br/><br/>But, what I didn't expect was all the effort on cheating spent by the PCs. Our mad boys, Dr. Alexander and Ladon Green, decided to drug the horses.<br/><br/>Well, that was Ladon's idea. Dr. A found that utterly unaesthetic! Genetically modify the horses so you're not just giving them a temporary boost -- stronger, faster, better, horsier!<br/><br/>And the philosophical discussion blindsided me.<br/>And there were shennanigans, as this was no easy thing to arrange.<br/><br/>Oh, and Dorian Gray snuck into a zenana. Felicity, clockwork heiress, pretending to be Dr. Alexander's assistant Charity, first pretended she was under a curse, turning into a man one day a month, and had lost track of the days. We dubbed that persona Charles / Chaz. She convinced a friend in the zenana to be sympathetic and let her hide until the embarrassing curse passed for the month.<br/><br/>Then, she switched with Dorian. So, Dorian as Charles / Chaz explained that the curse would last till dawn, while Felicity now transformed to look like Dorian so that the apparently Not A Sports Guy Dorian could crush his opponents in polo.<br/><br/>Oh, but she was annoyed at the horse drugging / modifying, wanting to win as herself, so she made sure that the other team got one of the two modified horses.<br/><br/>Yeah, I kinda lost track of not the what, but the why, once or twice. The why had to do with establishing where people were so that folks in disguise wouldn't be suspected of being someone other than whom they pretended to be.<br/><br/>Anyway, Dorian got kidnapped because he was Obviously a Spy, and his identity will be discovered next session. Oh, and the kidnappers have a very large grudge against Dorian.<br/><br/>And, Dr. Alexander got kidnapped by a Promethean scientist (why yes, yes I am using Victoriana and Dark Harvest), and as the player can't make that session, NPCs were sent to rescue him, especially as two of them were his "children" (i.e., he built them).<br/><br/>We have one more session before we go on 6 month hiatus.

It's got a set scenario: your starship detects a distress beacon on and alien planet and is sent to investigate. We had a brutal first few scenes, starting with a crash landing and following up with two or three scenes with our crew getting badly battered. Three of our crew members hunkered down in the ship while two of us decided investigate the beacon on our own. The engineer finally succeeded in fixing one of the key components to the ship, only to cause something else to malfunction in the process. The two crew who tried to investigate rushed back to rescue the rest of the crew were destroyed in a ball of fiery glory, leaving the crew left in darkness on the derelict ship waiting and hoping their rescuers would be there soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463764/#Comment_463764" name="Item_278" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-08T14:05:57+00:00" title="June  8, 2017  2:05PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2017 2:06PM by Aviatrix.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...well, what I played lo these last several weeks:<br/><br/><b>Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne</b> for the monthly "mostly kinda freeform night."

Section 2C is up to their old hijinks at Pashkowskaya station. One of the airwoman had a murky secret: she was really the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Fortunately Yusip the NKVD guard recognized her when she went to steal clothes for the talent show. The new Soviet anthem was sung with gusto, and almost nobody died! Well, except for the gal who killed a NKVD soldier. Didn't end well for her.<br/><br/><b>FAE: Uranium Chef</b> An amusing little game of celebrity chefs on a reality show in a space opera setting; does a nice thing with the approaches by having the regular approaches be the "reality" approaches and then having a separate set of "cooking" approaches (Sweet, Savory, etc.) <br/><br/>Meanwhile prep for the last two sessions of The Unanswered Question, my Tatters of the King in the 1950s game is for once well in hand.

(The idea is that the campaign will continue for a long time and I really hope it will.)</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>What is it\u2026?</dt>\n<dd><p>You know how in many storygames, the \u201cconsequence engine\u201d is a bit handwaved because what people care about in those games is the drama, the decisions etc? For example, you might say \u201cIt\u2019s me, you and Jenny and we\u2019re in a car going way too fast down the highway, sixmonths later\u201d. And you don\u2019t always sweat the details.</p>\n<p>So, just as an experiment\u2026 we <em>are</em> sweating all the details. Keeping track of every arrow, every gallon of water, every dinar, every spell slot. While still setting scenes and doing drama in a fully story-game way. We\u2019re also doing something else that\u2019s unsual for story games: we\u2019re trying to adhere to, and honor, a published setting, with players studying the world book between sessions and incorporating it into their play, using some language from the setting etc.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>What are the rules?</dt>\n<dd>We\u2019re using Dramasystem (a.k.a. Hillfolk) for the setup, characters, and scenes. We\u2019re using D&amp;D as a \u201cphysics engine\u201d (as much as \u201cCure Light Wounds\u201d counts as physics\u2026)<br/></dd>\n<dt>What parts of Hillfolk are we using?</dt>\n<dd>We\u2019re using page 1\u201319 + page 22\u201335 + page 50\u201365. That we\u2019ve removed the procedural system <small>(a system that I actually think is fine for what it is. Obv we don\u2019t need it if we\u2019re using another game (which Hillfolk itself suggests on page 65). The procedural system, I think has two problems: 1. While not bad, it\u2019s so unusual that it\u2019s hard to learn, remember, and use. 2. Conflict-level resolution doesn\u2019t mash well with Hillfolk. We\u2019ve had some cool scenes where violence and emotional drama have been mixed. Swords have been drawn, arrows fired.)</small> isn\u2019t that unexpected but we\u2019ve also removed bennies and the end-of-session voting. We\u2019ve also removed the \u201csetting a theme\u201d thing (p 23 top left) which causes some cards in the precedence order to move around. Instead the DM just has a card that\u2019s shuffled around with everyone else and a random participant (player or DM) starts the session, without themes. We <em>are</em> using challenges, ducking a scene, crashing a scene rules etc and we are using the token economy. We reset it after every <em>second</em> session because we\u2019re a large group and we do drop in drop out. (We tried the count 15 scenes thing and it didn\u2019t work. With a large group the tokens get so spread out.)<br/></dd>\n<dt>What parts of D&amp;D are we using?</dt>\n<dd><p>The base edition on the player side is 5e, but five out of the ten players are using my own <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">Searcher</a> class. (A \u201cclass\u201d with no ability scores, no nothing. It\u2019s inspired by Searchers of the Unknown and 3:16. It pretty much has a Fighting Ability (called \u201cAttack Bonus\u201d), a Non-Fighting Ability (called \u201cAbility Bonus\u201d), and some HP and some HD and that\u2019s it. It uses Ability Bonus instead of armor class to defend itself. But we also have some players using full 5e classes with feats and multiclassing. We started the campaign at level 5 and over four sessions, a couple of them have gotten 400 xp, that\u2019s it. We\u2019ve defined xp as practical power and made a deliberate choice to not have it grow from dramatic scenes. We do have some xp for gold rules too (in the dungeon, you get the xp from monsters, but if you make money on mercantile ventures or in the domain game, you can get xp from that). We also use plenty of rules from ACKS for various things. Everything from \u201cHow many diamonds are available for purchase in Hawa this month?\u201d to prices of goods in the big coastal cities. I made my own weather rules that sticks pretty closely to 1e WSG (my work on translating the 2e DMG+Golden Voyages rules to <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/aq-golden-voyages-state-machine/" rel="nofollow">state machines</a> was for naught; we threw those rules out because they are so storm prone. We use 2e for boats and sailing and we use many monsters and NPCs from 2e with minimal conversion.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re not using minis and we\u2019re not using the normal initative system <small>(again, because I want to mix dramatic and procedural \u2014 like how in X-Statix there\u2019s a couple of scenes where they\u2019re fighting enemies while talking about their own drama. That has happened in our game!)</small>. We\u2019re using some options from the DMG \u2013 most notably \u201clong rest is 7 days, short rest is 8 hours\u201d and \u201cLingering Injuries\u201d. And the rule from Unearthed Arcana where players make all rolls.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve combined inspiration and drama tokens. You can get more than one insp, and spend them as drama tokens. Or, you can hand them <em>all</em> in to give yourself or anyone else advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve moved encounter checks player side and made the encounters happen on low numbers. So you can have advantage or disadvantage on them.</p>\n</dd></dl> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463806/#Comment_463806" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-10T07:07:59+00:00" title="June 10, 2017  7:07AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<dl><dt>What\u2019s the setting?</dt>\n<dd><p>It\u2019s a part of Forgotten Realms called Zakhara (strictly, they\u2019re based on Island of the Firethorns just off the coast of Zakhara) that was marketed under the name \u201cal-Qadim\u201d in the early nineties. It\u2019s a bit of a deep cut. I got the boxes off an auction site. We\u2019re getting super invested in this setting and are always consulting the books as our \u201ccanon\u201d. The pitch I use is \u201cIt\u2019s the A Thousand and One Nights with elves and orcs\u201d.</p>\n<p>More specifically, in one of the boxes there\u2019s a railroaded adventure where the PCs go up against a Corsair Council of powerful NPCs. In my game, instead, some of the PCs <em>are</em> on that council. In the end, only two out of the ten chose to be full council members (so we have the six \u201ccanon\u201d NPC members + two PC members) because it\u2019s often really interesting to play outsiders. Some are working to join the council, some are trying to bring down the council. Some PCs are working for Qudra, some for Hawa. There\u2019s a <em>lot</em> of CvC.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>What are some deets about the setting?</dt>\n<dd>The \u201csalt bond\u201d is a huge part of the game; if you eat together, you have to protect each other for three days. Qudra and Hawa are at a cold war so espionage is also a big part of it. There are also cults and yog-sothothery going on.<br/></dd>\n<dt>How is it going?</dt>\n<dd>I was concerned that the multiple systems would clash. That they would create a very narrow window of possible outcomes. That setting scenes together would be difficult if travel is difficult. That \u201cplay to lose\u201d is harder when you can die at any time. So far\u2026 it\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s the most ambitious campaign I\u2019ve ever been a part of. People are so invested.<br/></dd>\n<dt>How is the prep adherence?</dt>\n<dd>(Since we\u2019ve been talking about D\u2192D and H\u2192H before.) It\u2019s a mix of improvised elements and prepped elements. Trying to use my normal fallback plan, sometimes I only realize later that \u201cOh, I could\u2019ve rolled for that\u201d. For example, yesterday, they met two random smuggling corsairs from another crew. I could\u2019ve rolled randomly among four or so crews that it would made sense that they were down there. Instead, I just chose one that I thought made sense. I realized after the game that rolling could\u2019ve been a possibility. We\u2019re doing a lot of transparency of method so the players know perfectly well how the game is set up.<br/></dd>\n<dt>What\u2019s the CA?</dt>\n<dd>(James, it\u2019ll only be this one paragraph, OK? Because I know some people are curious.) This is a big lab. And we have some players who are hip to RPG theory so people are sometimes trying to immerse, sometimes trying to stir up drama, sometimes trying to explore a dangerous location. In other words, people change their CA and try different things. It\u2019s not ouija-boarding because the game is setup to be able to do drama fully and to do investment in everyday life fully. Like, following the prayer routine (the party are split between being devout followers of Najm and devout followers of Jisan \u2014 religion is a <em>big</em> part of the game) or working on repairing the boat. Or looking for treasure maps or caring for the prisoners. Or confronting each other about failed romances, sibling rivalries, vying for position to be rubban (a sort of captain) on the zarug (a type of ship). And sometimes it\u2019s play to lose, sometimes it\u2019s play to win.<br/></dd>\n<dt>How\u2019s the separation between character knowledge and player knowledge?</dt>\n<dd>It\u2019s a mix. For example, the players know that one of the PCs is a full-sworn spy for Qudra, but their characters don\u2019t know that. They have to pretend (this is story game basics). But there are plenty of BIG secrets that the <em>players</em> don\u2019t know either; both things the DM is keeping from them, and that the characters are keeping from each other. Managing this mix well is a big part of the game, it\u2019s a challenge for all of us but it\u2019s also been the biggest source of interesting events to happen in the game.<br/></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Thank you for reading, my friends.

We managed to save Old Terra, which, to our shock, is trying to have an actual, functional government. We thought we might have doomed the cluster outside of Old Terra because of an alien invasion, but discovered that Green Sun has a less lethal version of the plan that old alien tech had for Old Terra, aka hide until the aliens go away by cloaking the entire planet and maintaining radio silence. This is surprisingly workable.<br/><br/>So, we now have to go to Galliard to save the children of one of the PCs and then find a place to hide from the invasion. Green Sun is ideal if we can get back there without compromising it. Old Terra will work if we can get there, but my PC, the Butcher of Old Terra (it's complicated: He didn't commit the first atrocity, and the second was only him nuking his own castle to try to kill a monster. No one other than gods and monsters were there at the time. And then he became emperor briefly and is now believed dead.) isn't so eager to go back there. He'd originally thought joining a circus would work, but now thinks the group should make movies to entertain all the sentients hiding out during what will become known as The Long Silence if we don't screw up and get everyone killed...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463955/#Comment_463955" name="Item_297" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-14T13:56:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2017  1:56PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>D&amp;D 5e</b> (Mirrorrim megadungeon) last night.<br/><br/>Highlights: <br/><br/>After clearing 15-20 rooms...<br/>"How much of this level have we explored?"<br/>"Like 15%."<br/>"Holy crap.

The idea was to give everybody a taste of Sorcerer, and I believe I at least managed to pique their interest, even if the "story" itself remained unfinished. In retrospect, I may have spent too much time explaining rules and going through the character sheets, background, etc. On the other hand, I prioritized pointing out the differences from "here's your character sheet" convention one-shot freeform scenarios the players might have been familiar with, and I don't regret my choice.</dd>\n<dt>Dungeon crawl (3hr slot)</dt>\n<dd>Using <i><a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/2015/09/the-full-dark-stone.html" rel="nofollow">The Full-Dark Stone</a></i> adventure location by <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a> and <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> 1st Edition (1975) rules. This is a game I regret we didn't manage to finish, because I was definitely having fun - it could easily have gone on for 3 more hours, really. Even unfinished, this was, in fact, my most satisfactory attempt at running a dungeon crawl, ever. I had clear expectations I managed to communicate the players, and they honored them and we all had fun.

After playing a full home campaign of this, I took it to the meetup to showcase it and earn bragging rights. We played a 4-players one-shot with original pre-gen characters out of the box: Amber, Clarity, Detritus and Serenity. The Realm we ended up in was an island-tower (actually a huge hollow tree) ruled by a mad toymaker, who kidnapped people to remake them into living toys to appease a crazy Wonderland-ish "queen" who was actually a toy he himself had fashioned after his own late mother.

It was a good fantasy adventure one-shot and I feel proud of my work (even if that work amounts to mixtaping half a dozen existing games).</dd></dl>\nThere could have been a <i>Witch Quest</i> game, as well, but there wasn't.

We wanted something a little more lighthearted (you know, for a slasher film), and came up with Count Chocolate and the Sugar Mansion. We (a bunch of candy people and one meatloaf) were all mysteriously invited to the house by the dashing Count, and one by one we were picked off. But the Count was just a Red Swedish Fish--the real killer was the house itself!<br/><br/>One of the things I guess people run up against in Final Girl is that the killer seems to teleport around, but having the killer be the setting really helped us negate that potential problem. The one thing I didn't enjoy was all the failed murders. It felt like the killer failed a lot of times before it succeeded, and that kind of sapped my energy.

We had some problems getting the rules down; the two facilitators had to absorb or than rather quickly because  they didn't have much time to prepare. We also had a bit of trouble interpreting some prompt cards. Two of our players showed up about an hour late and this made prep even more time-consuming and difficult.  Plus, we played with about seven, possibly eight people,  which I think was just too much. Anyway we only got done with about one Event,  and a couple people lost interest and we just called the game  at that point. The other facilitator and I,  really like the game and want to play it again. This time will get the rules down better, get set up done quicker and not allow people to be excessively late, and make smaller groups so we can get into the game much quicker. Anyway, it's an interesting game and I definitely want to try to again with a smaller group so that things don't get out of hand,  are easier to manage, and the time to please cut down. We certainly would've played in small groups if we would've had the rules are better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464042/#Comment_464042" name="Item_302" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-15T21:36:51+00:00" title="June 15, 2017  9:36PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2017 9:42PM by 2097.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>We got played by the god damned <strong>Corsair Council</strong> like a fiddle!</p>\n<p>When <em>Grima</em> comes knocking you better have answers.

It was fun, in part because I got to engage more with the crunchy bits, and also got to engage with the parser (which output is the closest thing I've felt to roleplaying with someone, especially when the phrases pretty much demand no interpretation, or something close to that.)<br/><br/>Still using the text parser for dialogue and also now for a "Narrator" who might frame the scene. I'm using the the movie transcript text assigned to MIMIC (the MIMIC 'voice') for the Narrator and NPCs in this scene at least. <br/><br/>I've still had to occasionally dig deeper into the parsed text for phrases that fit the context, especially when the conversations relate to relationships between characters. Chalk that down to the downside of randomness and the contents of the movie transcripts. A well chosen or constructed text to parse might fix this but I'm committed to the texts I assigned.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464133/#Comment_464133" name="Item_305" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T00:42:23+00:00" title="June 18, 2017 12:42AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Remember Tomorrow</b> last week (reskinned for fantasy) and <b>A Thousand Years Under the Sun</b> this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464136/#Comment_464136" name="Item_306" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T06:59:11+00:00" title="June 18, 2017  6:59AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Ben, what was your take on the games?</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464142/#Comment_464142" name="Item_307" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T18:00:32+00:00" title="June 18, 2017  6:00PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2017 6:01PM by Felan.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solid session of <b>Carolina Death Crawl</b>, which has been sitting unplayed on my shelf since it came out in 2013.

For when we have smaller player counts. Two\u2013three players + DM. For extra games (we already did the main CC game this week, Thursday).</p>\n<p>We played <strong>Cthulhu Dark</strong>. Beggars in Qudra, 1367. (Qudra is the city that\u2019s at war with Hawa in our main campaign.) It suited us very well and my players, one of them had been stoked AF and the other had been very reluctant, they both liked it. I turned Ammot (a weird al-Qadim\u2013monster) part of the life cycle of Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath, and I also had that when the cult (the Hand of the Gray Queen) had made the nest for the DYoSN, they had unearthed Hook Horrors (from the 5e MM) and trained them to do their bidding. So there were a mix of different monsters which I was concerned would dilute the horror but eh the session was good!</p>\n<p>I wrote the scenario using the random template generators in Silent Legions, pretty much by the book with two tags, but instead of Silent Legions custom pantheon and bestiary, I used the above mentioned D&amp;D monsters + the DYoSN from Trail of Cthulhu \u2014 and the \u201csample investigation\u201d cues in that book I applied to the scenario that Silent Legions had generated (it just happened to fit very well). I generated a random gross dreamscape in donjon.bin.sh which one of the characters constantly got sucked into when he got insight. Every time, the stinking mire was higher and higher and he carved for longer and longer.</p>\n<p>Then Microscope for the first time. We used <strong>Chronicle</strong> right away (after a while, I explained \u201cand <em>this</em> and <em>this</em> are the differences compared to vanilla Microscope) and one of the players said\u201dYeah, but I can see why the exp added these, I like these changes\u201c. (Not saying we\u2019re never going to do vanilla, just that we\u2026 really loved Chronicle!)</p>\n<p>We did the story of the party\u2019s boat from the main campaign from before our nakhuda and rubban Kezim bought our zarug (zarug is a type of boat), the Ummuhm. Apparently it got the name 150 years ago, when it was built to contain a wildly rampant djinn!</p>\n<p>It was a wild story with fights against sea monsters, enemy fireball blasting sorcerers, and the Ummuhm was at one point shrunken down to tiny size and put into a bottle! The players wanted to continue this one game of Chronicle, they\u2019re like \u201cthere\u2019s so much left to fill in!\u201d We only did two lenses (i.o.w. I, the first legacy, never got to be lens). And, we were so tired. We didn\u2019t do the \u201cthis is going to be the last focus\u201d thing either because we thought we would play longer. But we played so wildly. I was jumping around and laughing as the djinn Zobeida and her (also djinn) husband Hafam. I was playing the scenes like kids would play them!</p>\n<p>A lot of our scenes were very short. We\u2019re not used yet to not answering the question right away. Our very last scene we kind of got the knack of it. I understood where the player was going\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t <em>explicitly</em> stated.</p>\n<p>OK, one more thing about Microscope. The advice in Explorer is that the stories often aren\u2019t pretty good as linear stories. They feel good at the table but when you tell it in chronological order, it\u2019s often \u201cyeah, of course\u201d. So since I want to write up our 1001 Nights Off games as \u201ctales\u201d for our campaign site, that has been a riddle for me. But\u2026 it\u2019s Scheherezade-style! I can go tale in a tale! First tell the story about how Dusty \u201cOne-Armed\u201d Karim fled the ship after it being sunk by a fireball spell. Then later tell the story about how he, years prior, added the nickname \u201cOne-Armed\u201d in a fight against gawwar samakat (an already established sea monster in our campaign\u2014we paletted it). Then later tell the story about when the ship was in a bottle, then later tell the story about how the ship even had met the djinn Zobeida in the first place etc etc. I can wrap it up in fiction instead of as if it were an AP report, but I can still get the more interesting order rather than the chronological order. Best of both worlds\u2665</p>\n<p>We were playing slowly because we had been playing an intense game of Cthulhu Dark, then got candy and were learning Microscope, discussing the rules, and also discussing our main campaign, talking about it and things that were going on in it. <small>(Which\u2026 is one of my underhanded goals with 1001 Nights Off\u2026 to increase the players (including my own) knowledge about the setting, the situation, the genre, the political geography etc).</small></p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oh, yeah, palette thoughts. Our palette was pretty\u2026 \u201cwell, most of these are pretty obvious but we added them just to make sure\u201d-ish. Since we\u2019re playing in a very well defined, established setting, al-Qadim (and, trying to get to know that setting even better is one of the points of 1001 Nights Off). One good addition was gawwar samakat, a sea monster that\u2019s been legendary in one of the PC:s backstory in the main campaign (but who hasn\u2019t shown up in the main campaign yet) through our fanfics about that PC. The fact that it was added made we could discuss beforehand if it would be kosher or not to feature in our Chronicle. Another good addition that another player added was \u201cIn this chronicle, the Ummuhm can\u2019t spelljam, but other spelljammer ships can feature\u201d. Very specific and very clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit again:</strong> Instead of the cards, we used an outline program (I have a pretty souped-up <code>org-mode</code> with my own hacks). I type faster than any of our longhands, so I was taking dictation. We weren\u2019t sure about how good the overview was since we\u2019ve never played any other way. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever used any sort of digital thing while roleplaying. (We\u2019ve played Fiasco from PDF, which works for me because you only do it during setup, tilt &amp; outcome, not while actually doing the scenes.) But we liked this well enough.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kilocharliekilo" title="kilocharliekilo"><img alt="kilocharliekilo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kilocharliekilo">kilocharliekilo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464157/#Comment_464157" name="Item_309" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T20:12:22+00:00" title="June 18, 2017  8:12PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>A Thousand Years Under the Sun</i> on Thursday with a sci-fi skin; our communities were forming within a Dyson sphere encircling a black hole.

It had been on my "try this sometime" list since <a href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">@NickWedig</a> publicly released it, and our friends who were hosting really liked the elevator pitch, so we chose to play this over a couple other games I'd brought. It was a pretty good game - more of a long one-shot than the "mini-campaign" we were hoping for at first, but a good, satisfactory one-shot.<br/><br/>4 players, including me as the GM; we drew hands of 6 cards to create characters and I used the full d20 for John Moulton's Way of the Demonic Overlord. There were two betrayal-type secrets between the three PCs: "I'm secretly working to undermine the posse" and "I want to join Devil John not kill him". While some of us really liked creating characters by drawing cards, we found the resulting characters a bit overwrought, with too much backstory at 5 cards each.<br/>We especially liked the collaborative town-creation method. We played through 2 towns and rolled dice a lot. In the 2nd town, after finding out who the sorcerer was and a first, botched attempt at confronting her, players started hitting their endgames...<br/><br/>When they went to burn down the sorcerer's poison-making lab (in the abandoned local church), "Jeremiah the Coward" finally showed his true colors and shut his former companions in with the rattlesnakes and raging fire! In the ensuing conflict, Jeremiah's Way of the Bastard ending was triggered and he became a demon.<br/>Former teenage arsonist "Indian Will" made it out of the burning church carrying the dying "Dead Jack" in his arms and buried him in unhallowed ground, knowing he would eventually rise from the grave come next full moon - then went hunting for Jeremiah the Demon to extract from <i>him</i> the whereabouts of Devil John. "Indian Will" did meet the demon formerly known as Jeremiah, but it had the drop on him and demanded he revealed where Jack was buried, so it could finish the job. In the ensuing confrontation, Will's Way of the Soul ending was triggered and, after struggling free from the demon, he rode back to his home county and confessed his crimes: having atoned for his sins, but keeping the location of "Dead Jack's" body a secret, he eventually died on the gallows.<br/>In due time, "Dead Jack" rose from the grave. After a second, failed attempt to learn something from the town sorceress - in which he ended up killing her, despite his own scruples against killing - he went on to commit sins which would "recharge" his demonic miracles. In doing so, he confronted a corrupt sheriff, who was actually another of Devil John's many minions, and hit his Way of the Bastard ending. The demon-sheriff told Dead Jack that John Moulton had been watching him and testing him and, together, they rode out into the night on nightmare horses to join the warlock's all-demon posse.<br/>(John Moulton's Way score was then down to 5 vs an endgame value of 1, no scars)<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun brainstorming escalations of sin for demonic miracles, though in practice we found it difficult to "calibrate" them. We later reasoned you have to make a price <i>very</i> generic in order for the character to ever get a chance to "pay" it, since players don't frame their own scenes. One of "Indian Will's" demonic miracles - he could start fires through his concentrated gaze - had a price of denying a thirsty man water, but that never came up (despite a player introducing the idea of a poisoned water supply when creating town) and the miracle was never recharged. I guess the problem was with the verb "to deny" - you need something proactive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464171/#Comment_464171" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-19T13:22:50+00:00" title="June 19, 2017  1:22PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/kilocharliekilo" rel="nofollow">kilocharliekilo</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">@Dreamer</a>, I'm intrigued by your play of <i>Our Last Best Hope</i>; when I played it with some friends a few months it did not go well...I read that rule book several times, but there were still way too many various pieces to keep track of, and there were several times when were sat there going..."Wait?

But I wanted to introduce one of the architects of this, a trickster-assassin named Deathtrap.<br/><br/>I decided that the mob called Deathtrap in because they want revenge against Maximillian Mars, an industrialist who turned on them and became a benefactor to the Sentinels, the PC hero group.<br/><br/>I pictured an array of distraction attacks to keep the players busy while he hatches his plot to kill Mars. He did this via a fake villain who made demands (a la "The Mandarin" in Iron Man 3). I wanted to feature one fight for the players, so I made one of the demands of the fake villain to release a bunch of super criminals, and then have a bunch of booby traps go of.<br/><br/>But the players thought out of the box and decided that they would try to enlist the aid of Dollface (see my last post), a robot with a penchant for faking IDs. I liked this idea, so I rolled with it. But as a consequence, there were no fight scenes, just challenges and capers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464237/#Comment_464237" name="Item_316" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-22T03:14:50+00:00" title="June 22, 2017  3:14AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2017 7:56PM by Dreamer.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://solorpggamer.blogspot.com/2017/06/our-last-best-hope-killer-asteroid-act.html" rel="nofollow">Took on the Threat of the first scene of Act 2</a>.<br/><br/>On my prior scene, I messed up another rule regarding effects after a roll.

In other earlier scenes, when Black dice were added to the event pool, we should have also gotten story points, but I forgot. <br/><br/>So, the mistakes all kinda balance each other out in a way that did not give me a massive advantage or disadvantage.

I wasn\u2019t feeling malicious, I wasn\u2019t thinking \u201chehe I can get away with something\u201d, I was thinking it was fine. But that is how selfish acts are done. \u201cMaaaybe this is fine\u201d.</p>\n<p>I ended up really regretting that.</p>\n<p>It created a lot of contradictions and knots and made it hard for us to place other scenes. When it became untenable, we had a talk about it. We did two things to fix it \u2013 we changed it from a dictated scene to an event, and we renamed the period for it to fit. (Yes, so out of place was it that it didn\u2019t even fit in the period!!!)</p>\n<p>It was changed to \u201cBint digging up the knife from a lonely grave on a Beauty Mark island\u201d and the period\u2019s name was changed from \u201cSetara has the knife\u201d to \u201cSetara gets the knife\u201d. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/></p>\n<p>Both of these changes benefited me\u2026 I got more \u201ctelling out of it\u201d. OTOH, it was the cleanest fix. But later another player tried a similar thing. He wanted to start an RP scene.</p>\n<p>We already had the event \u201cBint hears that the knife once cut of the caliphs fingers\u201d and the scene \u201cBint hears how the knife cut the fingers and summoned efreet from another pirate, hears the directions to find the adventurers that has the knife, but kills the pirate after hearing the directions\u201d.</p>\n<p>I said \u201cI want to add \u2018Bint chases after the adventures\u2019 as an RP scene\u201d. (Normally he\u2019s good about doing Question, Setup, Required/Banned, but now he said this.)</p>\n<p>And we were like\u2026 \u201cThat sounds like an event\u201d but he said \u201cBut I want to do it as a scene\u201d and we said \u201cOK, cool, but what event would that be attached to?\u201d and we had this long long frustrating talk about what are scenes, what are events. And we were talking honestly about how we both had been trying to game the system to get more scenes in. (If we were playing with physical cards we might have avoided this argument.)</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>Another frustrating \u201cgame the system\u201d clash came when I had set a scene and put in: \u201cRequired: Spared adventurer. + At least one member of the Blue Roses\u201d and \u201cBanned: Nahua\u201d. So I was last to pick. First the spared adventurer got picked. Then another player (not the same as the one in the last clash) picked \u201cI\u2019m <em>another</em> member of the Blue Roses, heh heh, so you have to be <em>the</em> member of the Blue Roses\u201d. I mean\u2026 can you do that? I wanted at least one member of the Blue Roses to be present. And as soon as that\u2019s satisfied, the requirement is satisfied\u2026?! And I can pick freely?</p>\n<p>And that very same scene led to our fourth problem. We knew from playing that the knife was found buried with a body in a lonely grave.</p>\n<p>And I put the question \u201cWhy did Bint [the captain of the zarug \u201cThe Blue Roses\u201d] spare one adventurer\u2019s life?\u201d, set up \u201cOn the lonely island\u201d, and the character requirements above.</p>\n<p>And I had the idea, held pretty loosely, that Bint killed all the others but let one adventurer live for longer, I had no idea why (hence RP scene), but that that adventurer was going to be the body in the lonely grave. But, in order to make the idea looser in my mind, I put out \u201cAt least one member of the Blue Roses\u201d instead of \u201cBint\u201d (who was anchor character for the period btw). But when the \u201cSo you have to pick the member of the Blue Roses\u201d trick got pulled, I said \u201cFINE! I\u2019ll pick Bint then. OK? So it\u2019s settled.\u201d And the idea really solidified in my mind.</p>\n<p>And the player of that adventurer really tried so hard to avoid getting put into that lonely grave. And I was thinking \u201cMAN he\u2019s so stubborn, he\u2019s ruining the scene\u201d. In hindsight, of course I was in the wrong there. He was following the rules. The other player, the \u201c<em>another</em> member\u201d, he was thinking, like me, that \u201coh, so that\u2019s the body in the grave, how satisfying, of course it is\u201d, <small>(To our credit, there was a misunderstanding: the player thought \u201cThe question was \u2018why did you spare?\u2019 so we need to play the scene so that I\u2019m spared\u201d, while the rest of us, including me, the question poser, thought the question was \u201cWhy had this adventurer, who was <em>now</em> about to be killed, been spared up <em>until</em> now?\u201d \u2014 To our anti-credit, he is within his right to misunderstand the question like that, willingly or mistakenly. It\u2019s my duty to pose questions clearly and unambiguously, and to roll with the punches when someone finds a \u201cloophole\u201d <em>especially</em> when they find it by mistake)</small> so we started pushing for the adventurer to be killed anyway etc etc. But before we put it to the vote, the adventurer said \u201cWait. How is killing me answering the question?\u201d and the \u201canother member\u201d saved the day and started asking me, IC as Bint, \u201cOh, captain, by the way\u2026 why <em>did</em> we let her live?\u201d etc etc and we resolved it. And we let it unknown whether or not the adventurer was the body in the lonely grave or not. Phew. Long story over. Sorry.</p>\n<p>We were good about arguing, about being honest about our own bad behaviour and how we felt about the others\u2019 behavior, and we all said \u201cthis was a really good session overall and let\u2019s play Chronicle again soon\u201d. The topic drifted to cultural appropriation and al-Qadim and I\u2019m glad that we all said \u201cYes, it\u2019s a problem, potentially a big problem\u201d. It was a sign that we\u2019re approaching it with open eyes. (It was a longer discussion but this is but a margin!)\u2665\u2665\u2665 [I know I dropped two bombs here, us struggling with learning the Chronicle rules + politics! But. Don\u2019t. Or, rather: new threads!

It was a really cool and interesting game. We were a faction of English spies who were attempting to assassinate a Chinese strong man who had been prompt up by the English crown in exchange for providing the empire with Chinese resources. The Chinese strong man was very vicious and we were acting covertly against the will of our own crown and benefactors in an attempt to assassinate him. The session was frustrating being that we again had trouble getting on the same page regarding tone. This isn't a game issue, it is a recurring issue we have faced regardless of the game we played. A few of us have wanted to play a session with a serious tone, we have stated this in the beginning, and everyone has agreed to a more serious tone, but at some point the story tone goes off track and gets silly and lacks verisimilitude. Tonight we got about halfway through the game and a player who typically likes whimsical games started doing things like just randomly throwing dynamite at people. He just got obsessed with blowing things up,  because that's what's fun to him.  We have great games a lot of the time, but some of us really want to scratch the itch and have a serious session and it just doesn't seem like we've been able to find a way to do it, even when we've been explicit and forward about what we've wanted and reached agreement and consensus prior to the session. Even when we try to drop polite hints and try to reel someone back in. It seems that one or two people just don't seem capable of playing a serious game.  Not a game without humor, just a game in which the dramatic tone isn't broken with  absurdities. We don't want a serious game all the time but we do want the ability to have one, so it's been frustrating for a couple of us.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464491/#Comment_464491" name="Item_335" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-30T06:52:52+00:00" title="June 30, 2017  6:52AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a> my suggestion to you is: try to act a stronger host and curate the group of players.

Rather, select a few players who you believe really want a change of tone and invite them to play a game together in a private space, on a different night. Think of that as "the next stage". Scheduling will be the hardest part, but do try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464507/#Comment_464507" name="Item_336" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-30T22:31:18+00:00" title="June 30, 2017 10:31PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (For what it's worth, I agree that "picking the right team" is a big part of getting the right tone or creative consensus. I'm always thinking about that when I put together a game, and I think it's really key. However, game design can accomplish a lot of that as well. Jeff, I know you love the game, but from what I've seen of it, <i>Follow</i> does very, very little to help people get on the same page and stay there! Even <i>Fiasco</i> does a lot more to help people get on the same page.

Least good session so far, yet we all decided to keep the campaign going.<br/><br/>Standard 2097-style dungeon crawl (which in itself is good), but, slow and plodding due to two out of four players being sleep deprived and also (perhaps tiredness-induced) language barrier. One player constantly asking things that have just been stated. The other mostly spacing out, staring silently before answering.<br/><br/>We kept to the precendece cards even though it was all dungeon. As a guideline, I used 40 diegetic minutes, 15 extradiegetic minutes, or one major room or dramatic exchange.<br/><br/>Drama, we had way fewer real drama scenes, maybe three or so (but I've made a point out of not judging the value of proceducal vs dramatic \u2014 the player who's turn it is chooses).<br/><br/>The problem was the slowness of the procedural. The puzzles were difficult but they dealt with them.<br/><br/>Oh, and this started our first foray into one of the Yawning Portal dungeons. Looks good so far. As a curious aside, one of the 2e monsters that I've converted from one of the CotGS dungeons showed up in an official 5e version. So unbelievably nerfed. But, lower xp accordingly, so that's fine.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm happy about the campaign and we already have NO-sessions scheduled this week also.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> It sounds like I'm putting all the blame on the two tired players (we were four players + 1 DM = total). I should add that my slowness in parsing the wordy room descriptions in the YP book was just as big a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464671/#Comment_464671" name="Item_340" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T20:58:01+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  8:58PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played PSIRUN.

We sort of mixed the roles a bit too much, giving the mamluks farisans abilities to drive off efreet. I ported over a lot of the same concepts; such as them being fresh-faced teens, combined mailmen+religious police etc. They were part of the al-Wajid section.<br/><br/>For the law we used the very detailed code in the Land of Fate boxset, adhering to the rule that the GM shuts up as the players and their PCs make the calls. We skipped all that 'gender roles' stuff, let's hope the game works anyway. Even with endoqueer relationship problems such as 'just pretending to love someone' or 'wanting to leave someone'. But yeah, there's a <i>lot</i> less to work with <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> The original DitV setting is about patriarchy to a great extent. (I know there are Jedi hacks etc so I don't think it's integral to the game.) Weird, the original AA book presents a patriarchal world but the tone quickly changed in the boxsets that followed (men in niqab, polyandry etc), and I'm grateful for that.<br/><br/>I'm going to reread the rules after the session because there were some "huh\u2026 not sure how this part works"\u2013moments. How often to roll demonic influence etc.<br/><br/>And, one player wanted to make an inner conflict about whether or not he could bring himself to execute a killer. Which I thought would've been supercool to play out but I didn't know where I would've gotten the dice? It wasn't initiation, it was mid town.<br/><br/>Also, we didn't finish the first town. We were too tired, or, I was. Even though we had only played for two and a half hour or a little longer than that.<br/><br/>We are going to give the game more of a chance with the same characters. And are witholding review until then.<br/><br/>Ofc, a lot of what DitV presents as new, such an "GM, you are not allowed to have a solution in mind", are standard to us. But some things were new even to us. Like the fact that it's not a mystery/exploration game. The cards are supposed to come out on the table and I tried the best I could with that.<br/><br/>Edit: just to be clear, we are playing it RAW except for the changed setting. I know for example "rolling for talking / convincing" is anathema in my own designs including CC, but in Cthulhu Dark and esp in DitV, we <em>do</em> use these rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464728/#Comment_464728" name="Item_343" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-08T22:55:35+00:00" title="July  8, 2017 10:55PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2017 3:35AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464732/#Comment_464732" name="Item_344" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-09T17:56:45+00:00" title="July  9, 2017  5:56PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had Birmingham Indie Games <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> at the Geek Retreat today and I MC'ed a game of Monsterhearts for four players (plus one latecomer who happily played one of the antagonists as an autonomous character).<br/><br/>The usual twists and turns ensued as we zeroed in on the meat of the plot, which culminated in an epic werewolves vs. androids battle in the school grounds after midnight!

The end result was a much more focused town and one that looks like it\u2019s going to feel a lot more true to our take on al-Qadim.</p>\n<p>I used the aQ sin hierachy and the NPC generator last time as well, but this time I felt more sure about the process and it went faster and looks better. Just like how the first time I\u2019m walking somewhere new in the city, it feels like it takes ages because I\u2019m unsure \u201cis this the right street\u201d etc; even though I\u2019m constantly walking in the right direction, the minutes fly by and it feels like it takes ages. But the second time walking there I relax, just walk, and it feels a lot faster and straighter. The last town had too much stuff, this might have too little. We\u2019ll see. I feel good about it.</p>\n<p>Also, after last time, I was like\u2026 \u201cthere\u2019s not going to be much left of this DitV town generator process if I\u2019m going to be so post-poly &amp; endoqueer about the sex stuff\u201d. But now I feel relaxed in thinking that there are many other things that the game can be about. Last time started with skipping prayers, felt a little tame so I cranked it up to public drunkenness, felt even tamer so it got to murder right there in the first town. End result: a pretty messy town with a mix of \u201c<em>this</em> is what the fuss is about?\u201d with \u201chmm, this might be a bit much for the first town\u201d.</p>\n<p>OK, the rest of this post was written after the session. We had a great session, more coherent, more believable, very thematic with lots of info on the mamluk\u2019s dutiful branch, lots of CvC, lots of very nearly dying, lots of doubt and angst!</p>\n<p>The conflict was over some stolen weapons. I was kinda thinking that a more innocent crime would be a great contrast to last time and I think was right. \u201cDo we really kill them for hiring someone to steal weapons?\u201d</p>\n<br/><small>Trix, would love to hear some more about your Watch game!</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464749/#Comment_464749" name="Item_349" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-10T23:35:18+00:00" title="July 10, 2017 11:35PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been away at <b>New World Magischola</b>, where I played different crusty professors on two consecutive weekends.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464753/#Comment_464753" name="Item_350" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-11T06:36:28+00:00" title="July 11, 2017  6:36AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was at DexCon where I was in:<br/><br/>Wednesday night's Cthulhu Dark, where I was one of a group of immigrants trying to figure out what had caused our English instructor to go mad<br/><br/>Thursday afternoon's With Great Power, run by Bill White. It was a blast, but I still don't quite get the system, possibly because I've never played Swords Without Master<br/><br/>Thursday evening's Call of Cthulhu, an Invictus adventure I'd read, but the GM assured me that this wouldn't matter, and was basically correct. The problem with this sort of thing, for any decent gamer, isn't resisting the temptation to use out of character information. That's easy. It's figuring out when your character would figure it out and not playing to dumb. For various reasons, this is less of a problem in this particular scenario.<br/><br/>I was the only person signed up for the Thursday-Friday midnight-4am slot, so the GM did the sensible thing and cancelled this slot. This was good because my next game was --<br/><br/>Friday morning's This Favored Land, run by Bob Dushay<br/><br/>Friday afternoon's Beyond the Wall, which was a lot of fun, but when you get right down to it, it's the sort of game I'd use Everway to run. Also, it was in Calcutta, which meant we were all shivering from the chill. OTOH, I got to play the Village Bear! Hard to beat that.<br/><br/>Friday evening's Masks game, run by Kat Miller, with a big bad who was simultaneously sympathetic and impossible to compromise with. She'd be making sense for a few minutes, and then -- Nope. Just nope.<br/><br/>Friday midnight's Blue Rose, AGE version, with more combat than I'd expected. A lot of fun, though the system feels one step too complicated for me, and I'm not sure which step that is. I really hope it'll get a Fate conversion one of these days.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon's Tales from the Loop, where, as one of the other players put it, we saved the 80s from dinosaurs using a walkman.<br/><br/>Saturday evening's Montsegeur 1244, where, yes, my primary character burned for his beliefs.<br/><br/>Sunday morning's Agents of the Si-Fan, a valiant, multicultural group fighting against British imperialism in the form of Bulldog Drummond and his men. We played this one pulpy, but utterly straight. Also, I have a lot of fascinating source material to look up, including a movie called (in translation, I'm sure) Ghost Lady.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon, we caught Spider-Man: Homecoming, which did not suck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p6" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017">1</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p6" rel="prev">6</a><a class="Highlight p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p7">7</a><a class=" p-8" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p8" rel="next">8</a><a class=" p-9" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p9">9</a><a class=" p-10" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p10">10</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-12 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p12">12</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p8" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20918%2Fx%2Fp7%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20918%2Fx%2Fp7%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What did you play this week?

We saw a family fall apart as their small city-state slowly declined. Lots of sweet father-son sadness.<br/><br/>Then I got to play the single raunchiest game of <b>Fiasco</b> that has probably been played.<br/><br/>On Saturday, I played <b>One and Many</b>, a game in playtest about mythic beings shaping the world. It was surreal and beautiful, and I'm very excited for it to finish development!<br/><br/>The afternoon slot was <b>Breakers</b>, which is a World of Dungeons: Turbo game. We may have gotten an F for loot, but we got at least a C in friendship?<br/><br/>Then in the evening I facilitated an excellent game of <b>Follow</b> using the Gods playset. We kinda played modern gods trying to hold on to mortals as they spread across the stars, but mostly we just played office politics! It was super fabulous. <br/><br/>Sunday morning I got to play <b>Sign</b>, a larp based on the development of Nicaraguan sign language. It was really fun and interesting, and if you ever have a chance to play it, you certainly should. <br/><br/>And then for my final slot, I played <b>My Daughter the Queen of France</b>, one of my absolute favorite games. Shakespeare, once again, does not understand his daughter.<br/><br/>It was an amazing con!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464776/#Comment_464776" name="Item_352" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-12T20:16:32+00:00" title="July 12, 2017  8:16PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><b>Corsair Council</b> session seven. Second session of the big dungeon crawl (there\u2019s been some light exploration of subterranean water ways in the first five sessions but for the last two full sessions, we\u2019ve been in dungeon mode proper).</p>\n<p>I loved the session and thought it was better that the last. Talking about it with the players, we\u2019re not so sure. The main points of drama was between NPCs vs the party; a rival crew of pirates that have entered the same dungeon. The dungeon exploration was slower because we break for scenes, but then when we do post-hocs on the scenes (as per Dramasystem) the players are like \u201cOK, I guess that was a no conflict scene\u201d or \u201cOK, I guess that was just a pipe / infodump scene\u201d. It\u2019s like they gear up to do drama but then the other player just gives.</p>\n<p>And the dungeon part was super finchian and detailed. We spent like twenty minutes on what turned out to be the inside of a secret door. They thought it was a trap they had to disarm. We had some meta talk about that as well, I said that I know a lot of people online disparage DMs that require pixel hunting but they said that they do like it generally and that I should keep it up; it just happened to take up a lot of time this session but that\u2019s a risk that\u2019s worth it to them.</p>\n<p>We also invited a new player, someone I don\u2019t know and he only knows one other person. I want to have more women in the group now and more people that doesn\u2019t have as much trad experience. But he said, after the session, that he wanted to read Hillfolk as soon as he could (\u201cto see what\u2019s going on\u201d). This guy is very welcome and I appreciate having a new player since so many of our regulars are away fror the summer, let\u2019s see how he works out. large player pool is great since we\u2019re doing drop-in/drop-out.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I dunno.

FU isn't a game I would necessarily choose to play but its not a bad option in a time crunch. It's a little too traditional and it has a very bifurcated  GM and character split, so it's not the best fit for my tastes. It probably works best as an adventure game, or at least a game where the characters are largely on the same side. Next week we are playtesting a very traditional, strait up Simulationist game designed by <a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">@Mongrel_GM</a>; it should be interesting\u2014it should certainly be a treat for any players looking to scratch that traditional RPG itch <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465798/#Comment_465798" name="Item_391" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-20T15:25:37+00:00" title="August 20, 2017  3:25PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2017 3:26PM by 2097.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Was feeling in a rut.

(8 bottles between two of us, it turns out. This also turns out to be the correct amount for 4 people from Wednesday through Monday.)<br/><br/>Vanagard, which is Fate of the Norns light and family friendly and playable in two hours or less. (Also more, but the two hour figure's the important one.)<br/><br/>Blue Rose AGE, Intrigue in Tanglewood. (Fun, but some jarring in tone I'm still mulling over, as some of this also occurred in Shadows of Tanglewood, which I played at DexCon.)<br/><br/>Pythos, RWBY, the one game Josh and I both played, even managing to get the PCs we'd hoped for. (He wanted Ruby, while I wanted Nora, which should surprise no one knowing both us and the show.) This was exactly what we expected, and the other two players were great -- we all knew what we'd signed up for.<br/><br/>Clockwork: Dominion, Inheritance. Another one where we all knew what to do. An oddity in that there were three men and three women and we all played our actual gender. This was not mandated; it just happened. (I tend to play cross gender.) The GM noted that a) the game usually ends in either a big social combat or a big physical combat -- talking or shooting -- and b) this one was clearly going to end in both. And it did, and the twists and turns had us all on the edge of our seats.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu, An Eldritch Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Exactly what it sounds like, and all of us were in exactly the right mood. I was Pseudolos! Hero had the best puppy dog eyes and idiotic innocence. He was one of the two survivors -- Pseudolos, Senex, and Hysterium all wound up dead. The other survivor, astonishingly, was Rufus Vestis.<br/><br/>Games on Demand, A Taste for Murder, at speed, which meant some detail was lost, but we all had our best Awful on for the Cozy setting.<br/><br/>Clockwork: Dominion, Power. A bit low energy starting out, for reasons, including all of us having the last two days of the convention catch up with us, but hey, I got to play a Science! guy who used robots and taser guns to fight.<br/><br/>Castle Falkenstein, Babbage Engine. I've missed Castle Falkenstein! This was a blast.<br/><br/>Dinner Amoeba, aka managing to get together with friends on the West Coast and their friends and eat dinner despite everyone's varied schedules.<br/><br/>Dweomer by Gaslight, Goblin Market. Yep, I was very 19th century this convention. This started slow, with 2 players. Then three folks wandered in, unsure we could fit them all. We assured them that we had five spots and it was totally not a problem. At that point, we all slipped into groove. Extra takeaway: Do not schedule a one hour game immediately after another game that is in the J. W. Marriott if the one hour game is anywhere other than the J. W. Marriott. Totally worth missing the one hour one for the end of this one, mind, but something to keep in mind for the future.<br/><br/>Let's Find a Different Game, aka Takeaway 2: Read your ^%(*&amp; tickets, even if you know what they say. I'd come into Gen Con firmly convinced I had a 10 am game on Sunday. It was an 8 am game. I apologized and was assured that it was all right, then found myself a different game.<br/><br/>Dreamchaser, aka I'm not the only one missing the obvious. This was a lovely 2 hour taste of the game, which was pretty much exactly what I wanted. It was intended to be a 4 hour session, but the other player, the one who'd remembered when his game was, had thought it was a 2 hour game, so had scheduled something for 2 hours after the start time.<br/><br/>Last Licks in the Dealers' Hall. I was both appalled and relieved to realize that the ARU folks were here and I'd not known. This is why I managed to buy only one new ARU, as well as a unique charm bracelet and a small necklace (or pendant -- not sure which it technically is). And hearing the dealers cheer at 4pm is great.<br/><br/>Post-Gen Con<br/><br/>Watching the Eclipse. Well, partial eclipse. No eclipse goggles, so one quick peek through sunglasses while squinting, a glimpse on a turned off cell phone used as a mirror, and amazing sunlight crescents on the ground as the trees became a pinhole camera.<br/><br/>Visiting People Who Were at the Same Gen Con by Trekking to the Other End of Queens. Yep, folks in from England -- and we were at the same table at the same time -- visiting a mutual friend in Queens which is how I got to meet them in person.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts 1.5 (i.e., using sneak peek pack rules -- if we do a second season, we'll switch to full 2nd edition). Took us a bit to hit our stride, but we did, and I jotted down a few quotes:<br/><br/>"How much worse can it get?"<br/>"Batler." (Batler is our Witch whose attempts to solve things with hexes... make it all so... interesting.)<br/><br/>Gang member about the Werewolf: If she will just let us open the doors for her -- it's not chivalry! We just don't want her breaking down the doors."<br/><br/>Queen: But if they're hiding her, you being big and obvious gives them time to move her somewhere else.<br/>Werewolf: But don't they have to go through a door?<br/><br/>GM: Take your choice -- knife, pen, paper, whatever.<br/>Queen: Well the knife is convenient.<br/><br/>So, the Queen and Witch became their Darkest Self, although the Queen stopped by giving part of her power to someone more... deserving... in... some sense of the word that will no doubt bite everyone in the ass next session. The Witch is still Darkest Self. The Werewolf was, frighteningly, the most reasonable person in the room. The (Unseelie) Fae has made a deal and made out with her Seelie counterpart.

It works great in a two-hour slot. I do it this way:<br/><br/>(1) Hand out playbooks; help new people fill theirs out; tell them to skip bonds because "we'll do that in play."<br/>(2) Note the opening tableau ("When play starts, you'll be in the dark and tangled Weirwood struggling toward volcanic Mount Purgato, where a fabulous treasure awaits.")<br/>(3) Go around the table and have players introduce characters in the context of the opening tableau ("Show us what you're doing, or what you're saying.")<br/>(4) Each PC then addresses another PC in turn in a way that signals their bond with that character, who replies in a way that signals their bond. Simultaneously, as part of that interchange, the first PC answers one of the story questions I've written out. These are questions like, (a) "What treasure do you seek, and why?" (b) "Who is pursuing it as well, and why haven't you been able to defeat them yet?" (c) "What danger lies between you and the cave mouth that leads to the heart of Mount Purgato." Some groups get this more easily than others, but by the end, everyone has two bonds and I have the outlines of the adventure.<br/><br/>I let them take XP for creating bonds and for answering story questions. At the end of each scene ("encounter"), I let them take XP for enacting bonds and role-playing alignment, and of course they take XP for failure. Whenever they take XP, instead of taking only 1 point, they gain 1d6 experience points, so leveling up happens pretty rapidly.<br/><br/>I wind up with enough time to run two big scenes, one in the woods facing the danger and one in the heart of the volcano trying to get the treasure from whatever guards it or is after it.<br/><br/>It produces some really fast, fun play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p7" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017">1</a><span class="Ellipsis">\u2026</span><a class=" p-6" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p6">6</a><a class=" p-7" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p7" rel="prev">7</a><a class="Highlight p-8" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p8">8</a><a class=" p-9" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p9" rel="next">9</a><a class=" p-10" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p10">10</a><a class=" p-11" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p11">11</a><a class=" p-12 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p12">12</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20918/what-did-you-play-this-week-2017/p9" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20918%2Fx%2Fp8%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20918%2Fx%2Fp8%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What did you play this week?

It is a 100% traditional, Simulationist RPG\u2014Simulationist is usually a dirty word at Story Games SLC, haha (just kidding, kind of <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/>)\u2014but we always play and are interested in Mongrel's designs, who has created an interesting and well designed Story Game called <b>Q&amp;P: Schism</b>. Mongrel's Story Game worked well even on the first playtest; its is already a good game, and I believe it has the potential to be a great game with time and effort. Unfortunately, Mongrel has lost interest in Narrativist games of late and put <b>Q&amp;P: Schism</b> on the shelf :-( but I'm an advocate for it and would love for him to continue play-testing and working on it. The game has great promise.<br/><br/>Anyway, playing two Simulationist, Binary GM RPGs in a row (i.e. games that strictly divide the roles of the GM and players traditionally) made me realize that I'm just not into them anymore. I just feel that the PCs are more reactive instead of creative and creativly engaged; there's just not as much collaborative creativity in these games. This had nothing to do with the quality of the designs or the GMs running the games; the issue is that the nature of these games simply isn't to my taste. I just don't find them as engaging and I don't feel like they involve the players as much. It's a lot of rolling dice just to see if you can do a task rather than actively creating a story together. I love the fact that in Collaborative GMless Story Games there  are different perspective shaping the story. Often I find that having a number of people with the different ideas  creates more interesting characters and more interesting story. That by having input from multiple people you get something greater than the sum of its parts. It is interesting to see how our tastes evolve over time. I actually am immersed in my characters less in GMed, Simulationist games  then in Collaborative, GMless, Narrativist Games. I don't find that the Simulationist games focus on character depth, personality, and motives as much. I don't find that the stories are as much about the characters emotional drives and desires as much as they are about overcoming tasks. This evaluation is completely based on my tastes; I'm not saying <i>how these games are</i>, I'm saying <i>how they are to me.</i> Anyway, it has cemented that, for me at least, these games actually don't  immerse me more in my character\u2014which is usually the reason those who like these type of games prefer them\u2014but actually immerse me less in my character and the story as a whole.  It is very interesting how our perspectives and tastes change, because I used to get more immersed in my character playing Simulationist, GMed games and now it is exactly the opposite. It makes me very happy that we have so many options for different tastes and different gamers.  I feel so indebted to the indie community, who took games like D&amp;D that I loved as a child, and still like as an adult,  and created new games that I am even more passionate about, which will sustain my hobby and keep my interest alive.

This turned out to be very important later when Paul Ryan showed up and found out too much about the facility, falling under Damien's influence.

One life our Hercules couldn't save was that of her sometime-boyfriend's mother, who had the misfortune to be a first responder.  The whole thing is being blamed on tainted fentanyl in the media.  The Hercules is getting universal praise while feeling broken up about the whole thing.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, our Queen-turned-Hollow was given an ultimatum by her cult: They may be a murderous cult, but they aren't <i>that kind</i> of murderous cult, like the Ghoul is; murdering people and eating them is gauche.

Barbara ended up keeping the same main character throughout the whole epic quest, while I switched: this turned out really nice, as there was this well-known touchstone/viewpoint character we both sympathized with and I loved to provoke, who was featured in about half the scenes and really grew complex and 3-dimensional over the 9 acts: "Connor" (aka Project 9817), human-mimicking AI in an actual human body and long-time "running man" living a rough life on the street.<br/><i>Unsurprisingly</i> (what is it about the maths of this game, that looks 50/50 but then we have a history of just being successful once out of 3-4 quests? do we just have terrible luck?) our movement for the equality of all sentients in a classically cyberpunk near-future failed tragically... It started out as a successful rebellion of AIs and synths against the company that had created us, but as (through the heroic sacrifice of my first main character "Woodstock", a sentient mainframe) we had occupied the lab compound it turned into a siege, which failed when one of the sentient computers evaluated our odds as hopeless and chose to betray us "for our own good" opening the doors to the company troubleshooters (read: private army). Having got some media attention, we still went on to be an activist civil-rights movement of AIs, other non-human sentients and human allies, but my new main character ("the Hobbs anomaly", a sentient computer virus purporting to be the first naturally occurring sentient life-form native to the Internet) took such brash actions (from a human point of view) that it quickly turned into the villain of the piece, basically threatening humankind with worldwide terror as a publicity stunt. It ended with Connor voluntarily turning himself in to the company so that they could use his (contaminated) brain to research the Hobbs anomaly - which was close to the absolute worst possible ending for Connor - hoping to save the world from it. It was tense.<br/><br/>We also tried out one of the Italian language Game Chef entries (<i>La casa altrove</i> by Francesco Zani) and we dragged two curious bystanders we'd never met before into a game of Ben Lehman's <i>SKEW</i> (always a great introductory RPG for oh-so-many reasons).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466090/#Comment_466090" name="Item_415" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-05T13:54:06+00:00" title="September  5, 2017  1:54PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2017 3:37PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tabletop:<br/><b>The Warren</b><br/><br/>Larps:<br/><b>Critical Path<br/>Sarabande<br/>Inheritance<br/>Winterhorn<br/>Muovikuppi<br/>Welcome Guests<br/>A Baby Fell From The Sky</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466131/#Comment_466131" name="Item_416" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-08T03:23:24+00:00" title="September  8, 2017  3:23AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran the fourth playtest sitting for a game I'm working on, about the relationships between members of a team.<br/><br/>The session itself had good drama, but I think I've lost sight of my original primary goal (being that I never want anyone to have to break character mid-scene), while in persuit of neat mechanics.

I realize the above might sound dismissive to some. What I meant was: there are a huge number of "chamber" (or small-scale) larp scenarios - including from the Jeepform and the American Freeform traditions, Golden Cobra, or in the upcoming book Crescendo Giocoso - which are organized in scenes but where, unlike most tabletop story-games, players are expected never to break character during a scene. I believe that to be a big deal, technically, and have come to believe it's the main design difference between larp and tabletop role-playing (physical acting or standing up versus sitting at a table being just a minor detail in comparison).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466137/#Comment_466137" name="Item_419" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-08T08:05:00+00:00" title="September  8, 2017  8:05AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2017 8:05AM by Rafu.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I forgot mentioning playing <b>Lovecraftesque</b>, too, some time over the last 3 weeks.

I'd say those one-shots where the ending isn't even a bit rushed and all loose ties come together in the end stand out as lucky, exceptionally successful examples. I've had a lot of such "paragon" games, but still they are a minority of all the games I've played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466147/#Comment_466147" name="Item_423" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-08T18:53:31+00:00" title="September  8, 2017  6:53PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/>This week and last, we played through a third <b>Leviathan Manifesto</b> case and have started a fourth.

I believe that to be a big deal, technically, and have come to believe it's the main design difference between larp and tabletop role-playing (physical acting or standing up versus sitting at a table being just a minor detail in comparison).</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> , definitely no dismissive intent was taken by me.

I am not quite sure why, but the witch's player will balance his tendency to play cautiously by making sure his PC does really dumb things for reasons that... okay, I won't say they make sense, but it makes sense that he'd do those things. So, the demon has a string on him. And his parents were overjoyed when he agreed to go to church with them and with someone who might or might not be an angel and basically destroy a grimoire from the local demon worshippers.<br/><br/>Trouble is, those demon worshippers are the fae's parents. Well, they adopted the fae. And they are so utterly understanding about their child explaining that they're going to marry another fae in a sort of political marriage. The father's even digging out the tuxedo for them. So, the fae is being accepting right back. Sure, their parents killed the biological child to get Really Good Crops, but hey, you know, that was years ago.<br/><br/>So the fae was NOT pleased that the witch stole the family grimoire, especially as it had the family tree and various marginalia in it, and there was violence (possible angel guy cracked his head against the font when the fae hit him to retrieve the grimoire) and hexing (the fae's father was unable to drive off because of the witch's hex), and much recriminiation and such, eventually ending with an agreement that the fae and their family could have the grimoire, sealed, and not open it without the witch's permission. And the witch grudgingly told the demon that, well, he didn't like the demon, what the demon did or stood for, but... but... he liked the demon's style, you know?<br/><br/>And the queen, who's basically a Dragon Princess from Seanan McGuire's Incryptid books is trying really hard to make sure everything works out, no one gets hurt -- especially here and hers (and she's had sex with all the PCs except the witch, and with the demon) -- and that the dragons make a profit.<br/><br/>I think no one is currently in Darkest Self. Everyone except the fae's been there at least once, voluntarily.<br/><br/>It's all a glorious mess, and I've no idea how things will end. It's really weird deciding the important things on the fly, and sometimes without thinking hard about whether they make perfect sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466330/#Comment_466330" name="Item_442" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T23:21:12+00:00" title="September 18, 2017 11:21PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First session (not counting last week's brainstorming/character creation one) in that Sci-Fi <i>Sorcerer</i> game.

We managed to occupy the time between parts with Psi*Run, Noirlandia and Honey Heist, but it was good to get back to Masks.<br/><br/>The gang were in Limbo, trapped in a nightmare VR machine by The Reformed's old mentor. The group engaged with way more mechanics than they had previously. I'd also written some Love Letters to the characters, presenting them with their darkest timelines.<br/><br/>The Legacy, Tyr, fought a failed version of himself and used his Moment of Truth to realise he didn't need to be his father or any previous version of himself.<br/><br/>The Reformed, Steel, managed to inflict enough conditions by calling the villain out on all his crap to cause the mecha/castle/giant version of the villain to crumble. Most of these weren't through combat, although Tyr knocking a tornado into it helped a bit.<br/><br/>Tyr burnt influence to rescue the Newborn, Apollo. The poor metal boy was knocked through the Limbo portal and back to Halcyon, but he lost part of his body in the process. Apollo ran home, hugged his father and for the first time ever, cried. <br/><br/>Tyr managed to come round to Apollo's with some beers and opened up about himself, hitting a Team Move.<br/><br/>It was a pure joy to run and the group did a lot of work. I've been realising that as daft as I like my games, one of my big desires is to *feel* something. This session provided that and was fantastic for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466779/#Comment_466779" name="Item_460" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-04T02:38:34+00:00" title="October  4, 2017  2:38AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traveller, at Travellercon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466781/#Comment_466781" name="Item_461" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-04T15:28:35+00:00" title="October  4, 2017  3:28PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran two four-hour sessions of my "Henry Knox and the cannons of Ticonderoga" in spaaaaaaace scenario for <b>Mongoose Traveller</b> (also at TravellerCon).<br/><br/>Played about 40 minutes of a four-hour session of <b>MegaTraveller</b> where the referee told everyone that, as long as we rolled high on 2d6 (implicit: even before adding stats), we'd probably succeed.

I think it worked better than when I\u2019ve run Fate in the past; part of the trick with running Fate may be saying \u201cno\u201d to skill and aspect uses that are a stretch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466811/#Comment_466811" name="Item_463" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T02:54:56+00:00" title="October  6, 2017  2:54AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traveller, at Travellercon, with Mel and Adam.

Points are tallied and there is a winner at the end.   We didn't bother with this...  Not a game I will seek out again, but I did really enjoy creating a story with some good people.

There were three of us veterans and one person totally new to RPGs. We gently guided him through Fiasco setup and at the end of that, he voiced his concern that he wasn't at the right skill level for the game. He was getting a little confused by the four characters and their relationships, which I didn't think were very complicated.<br/><br/>We started play and, first scene (not focused on him), asked him to play an "extra." He understood the concept, but immediately balked and asked to bow out of the game, as it was too hard for him, but asked to stay and watch. We agreed, but had to "reset" (brand new set of characters and stuff, still in Suburbia). He left about 3/4 through our game.<br/><br/>Since it was Fiasco in a 6-hour game night, we <b>played again</b> after, pulling in a few other people. Five total. This time, it was "The Ice." All of us had played Fiasco before.<br/><br/>Game play started out normal and great, and slowly the weird and supernatural dial started going up. We'd set up this promising non-science-related thing between my character and another. We were both oil entrepreneurs competing over a million-dollar drill bit in a boxcar. One other player was my competitor's assistant. The other two played spouses who were in Antarctica to protect a penguin preserve.<br/><br/>Then it started getting really weird. There was a flashback to a deal made to secure drilling rights plus an unlimited supply of penguin blood. My character and one of the nature preserve people got locked in a boxcar full of bags of penguin blood and some kind of giant blood-drinking goose monster. I felt like it was really off the rails. We finished Act 1 and called it when a few of the others said they needed to go home, but a few seemed to stick around at the bar and talk after, so I think they just weren't enjoying the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the weirdness was a product of "I'm bored, so I'll inject weirdness because I don't care" or if the weirdness caused them to not care, or both. It was a bar, so alcohol might have contributed.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467080/#Comment_467080" name="Item_485" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T23:15:50+00:00" title="October 17, 2017 11:15PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a Fiasco, Adam!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467082/#Comment_467082" name="Item_486" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-17T23:39:14+00:00" title="October 17, 2017 11:39PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played <b>Downfall</b> twice at Story Games Seattle, once Thursday and once Saturday.

Then, walked over the Queensborough Bridge and the rest of the way home, clutching Josh's hand as I got vertigo. Didn't stop walking, though.<br/><br/>Josh is using two of the Growing Up moves, and we're all slowly figuring out how that changes things. His Queen, Viridian the Dragon Princess, told Margot, the raised-by-wolves-not-literal-wolf Werewolf that she was not a wolf, and the player was trying to figure out how to justify taking the experience point she wanted while staying true to the character. I pointed out how she could have Margot accept this in a way that would make things Oh So Much Worse (hey, you know how you murdered the school nurse who'd killed your wolf mother? You couldn't have done this as only a wolf. You know how you're protecting your pack by holding grudges, like Viridian said, because they can't do that?), and she's chewing on that, happy with the suggesting, and playing a Melting Down Margonoke who handed in an essay where she wrote "Wolf" for half the words and attempted to analyze the story in the other half.<br/><br/>Me: Anyone have any idea what you're reading in English Class?<br/><br/>Witch's Player: The Most Dangerous Game.<br/><br/>(Brief pause as we explain what it's about to those who didn't know.)<br/><br/>Werewolf's Player: ... More than half the words will be "wolf", then, because there are places where "wolf" makes sense.<br/><br/>Oh, and the Werewolf has no guile or subtlety and totally copped to having killed the nurse, first to the other PCs who a) were not surprised and b) were not about to turn her in, and then to her adoptive parents, who, I think, want to institutionalize her at this point -- she hauled off and hit the mother when the mother echoed the Queen's words unaware, saying, "Honey, you are not a wolf", and then hit the father when he tried to intervene, and later, beat up a whole bunch of students who were persecuting the Witch because his parents decided to have a town meeting and tell people about the demon, which went about as well as the Witch predicted. He's planning to banish the demon one way or another, and if he needs a human sacrifice for that, well, he reckons he qualifies. I've thought of a couple of things I might or might not do to complicate that -- and might or might not do if he uses another tactic.<br/><br/>The Fae is planning their wedding to their opposite number, has accepted a favor from the demon, and is probably going to break up with their girlfriend who got magically drugged into being forgiving (because the Fae was annoyed the girlfriend was holding grudges about seeing the Fae kissing her adoptive sister) and I have been doing everything I can to make being forgiving go horribly wrong. Currently, she's been told enough and seen enough that she is convinced the wedding is not what the Fae wants (which is what the Fae told her) and that the Fae is likely to be killed and that she needs to take action to protect the Fae.<br/><br/>And somewhere in there, a rescue mission that folks were theoretically planning for a couple of sessions finally happened, almost an afterthought. Almost -- it plus the Fae's wedding are intended to solve a problem, and may well do so, as there are plenty of other problems.<br/><br/>So, ideally, I'd like to end with things resolved or things gloriously horribly unresolved. And I have no idea what will happen, and apart from that one idea vis the Witch, haven't done any prepwork, and the only prepwork I will do will be jotting down any other ideas that pop into my head so I don't forget them.<br/><br/>I've run one game where I couldn't prep before -- Dreamhounds of Paris, playtesting it -- and it went astonishingly well. This one -- well, I don't think it sucks. The players are enjoying it. It's going better, I think, than when I ran Sorcerer, I think in 2005, as I know a whole lot more. I'm enjoying not being able to prep much, having no idea where things will go even more than usual. I do think I could use sharper skills at keeping things from dragging, at making sure folks get into scenes and get to do cool stuff, at giving the consequences a bit more bite. And I know that some of what's in the game falls into Stuff I Do A Lot, because when I reach for something to start the stone soup or to add to it, I reach for what I know.<br/><br/>But, it's working. There may be a catch in the engine here and there; the tank may run dry on occasion. But, all of the parts work, and I'm getting a feel for how they shape a whole.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press" title="kelmscott_press"><img alt="kelmscott_press" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press">kelmscott_press</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467090/#Comment_467090" name="Item_488" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-18T07:30:33+00:00" title="October 18, 2017  7:30AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finished the <b>Masks</b> campaign.

It was a SF night. I was feeling a little under the weather, and people were missing, so I called it a night after helping the players update their characters (not many players have the books.)<br/><br/><b>Friday</b> was <b>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</b> day with a small group. I wanted to run something horror-themed since Halloween is night. I ran the Cthulhu-esque adventure "Sleeping Gods Lie" from Lucien Soulban's excellent <b>Supernatural Handbook</b>. When the players saw signs of Deep Ones, they asked "does Lovecraft exist in this world?" I quickly decided he did, but his tales were more folklore than fiction.<br/><br/><b>Saturday</b> was my <b>Pathfinder</b> Scarred Lands game. It was a fighty game, but I try to put in one roleplaying encounter per session, so I had them stumble on a kobold slave who they had freed when they took out some serpentfolk guards. This led to the questions "are kobolds evil in this game?" (Again, that meta-knowledge discussion, albeit with a different group.) I turned with question back to a setting-based one. The characters know that kobolds who dwell in catacombs under cities have a reputation of being vicious ambushers, but this kobold seemed pretty harmless and decidedly Dobby-like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467177/#Comment_467177" name="Item_493" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-23T03:08:25+00:00" title="October 23, 2017  3:08AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My <i>DayTrippers</i> campaign with <i>Legends of Tabletop</i> continued with Episode 4: "Into the Red".

There is so much more I could have done with the book, but circumstances and workload meant it was time to bring it to a tidy end.<br/><br/>My players aren't near to espionage/thriller fans that I am, so I think things went fairly well considering. As mentioned in an earlier post, I ran the Dracula's Mill captstone with things given an alien bent. I ran some of the flavor bits the DD facebook group helped me with here, and it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>I also dreamed up a nice classic espionage feel cut-scene for a character that was gone last time. MORGAN was getting some special meteoric iron ammo from a contact that Hound had compromised. Instead of taking MORGAN down, Hound warned MORGAN about HENLEY, the PC that CD had compromised (who I swapped in for the pilot of the helo above the falls).<br/><br/>My favorite bit was after they took CD down, one agent (ALI) plugged into the 4-dimensional alien computer and was staying behind to redirect the telluric currents to give the other agents a better chance of escaping. But there was some worry that if he stayed plugged into it, he would become the next vampire lord. BERNARD, the ex-SAS character, was worried about this, so his player used In the Nick of Time to plant a mini-charge on ALI. I told him he needed to make a filch test. He didn't have filch, so he recruited CHAKROUN for the task.<br/><br/>CHAKROUN's player noted the trust on the sheet and decided she trusts ALI more than BERNARD, and sabotaged the filch test.<br/><br/>So that's where it ended, with a little classical ambiguity and double-dealing in the ending.<br/><br/>I hoped to get deeper into the book. But I figure that DD is one of those campaigns like Masks of Nyarlothotep that you can visit again and again.<br/><br/>The bit with CHAKROUN and ALI served to emphasize that I find some sort of character personality mechanic baked into the game to be helpful. There are some I don't like, and some players tell me that they don't need the system to tell them how to role-play. But many player benefit in having just a little push to improve the role-playing experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467308/#Comment_467308" name="Item_503" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-28T22:26:18+00:00" title="October 28, 2017 10:26PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A great minicon yesterday ConFusion in Wellington, NZ (returning after being defunct for a few years).<br/><br/>I ran playtests of my games-in-development <i>Heavy Metal \xc6ons</i> and <i>Devil &amp; the Deep</i> which both went well, in the sense of "people had fun" and "lots of good material for improving them" and then finished off with a great game of <i>Fall of Magic</i> (which continues to provide novelty even though it seems like the story should always follow similar paths).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChumofChance" title="ChumofChance"><img alt="ChumofChance" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChumofChance">ChumofChance</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467316/#Comment_467316" name="Item_504" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-29T12:14:37+00:00" title="October 29, 2017 12:14PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running a solo <b>Eclipse Phase</b> campaign for my wife for a few months now, and she runs a <b>5e Eberron</b> solo game for me.

Also, they partly builded on the surface and made a mountain range happen. Anyway, the dwarves dug to deep and I got to do the Great disaster, and set up the factions of the age of monsters.

General consensus is that it was fun, though I regret not knowing the Witch was one xp away from an advance as I had an obvious opportunity to offer xp. When I asked how to do better next time, the two things that came up were:<br/><br/>1. Run with the full 2.0 rules. I'm fine with this -- they weren't available to me until close to the end of the season.<br/>2. We started off with rotating duties for doing a Last Time on... write up, but that slipped towards the end. We should figure out before we start playing who'd doing the write up for that session.<br/><br/>For a break, Delta Green's Observer Effect and probably finishing up the game we started of Fall of Magic the time one player couldn't make it at the last minute.<br/><br/>Wrapped Blood Coda for Dracula Dossier. Folks said yes, they do want to do the 1977 lg, and as NBA, not as Fiasco. (Aviatrix would've made up the Fiasco set if we'd gone that route, I think.) This means I need to do a f*ckton of reading and make sure to see Tinker Tailor, preferably with the whole group, just like I was forced, forced, I say, to rewatch The Third Man twice before running The Carmilla Sanction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467607/#Comment_467607" name="Item_522" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-11T10:25:06+00:00" title="November 11, 2017 10:25AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2017 10:35AM by DeReel.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly boardgames : Not alone, ghost stories, \xc0 la v\xf4tre (raise your goblet) at the monthly meeting.

The whole "master gm" vibe, a detailed setting and deep backstories, "no metagaming!", drawn out fights and investigation scenes, intense epic "story" style combined with long hours of nothing actually happening...<br/><br/>It's really like D&amp;D is supposed to be, you know? Dramatic narrations from the GM, a deep mystery that will take months or years to unravel..<br/><br/>They love the Traits/Bonds/Ideals because of the detail they add to the characters but they never reference them in play and do not award Inspiration for them.<br/><br/>A totally fascinating experience for me, full of all the good things and all the bad things I remember from playing d&amp;d. Quite a trip down memory lane, in a lot of respects.<br/><br/>One thing that really struck me was the sheer amount of time spent looking up rules for things. Normally I like to really stay "in the moment" and connect to the people I'm playing with, but here I had to have my head in the Player's Handbook almost constantly to look up spell descriptions, feats, which actions give advantage, whether a certain ability counts against undead, etc.<br/><br/>The entire combat sequence was maybe 1/2 or 1/3 playing out events and rolling dice and 1/2 or 2/3 flipping through books and looking stuff up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press" title="kelmscott_press"><img alt="kelmscott_press" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kelmscott_press">kelmscott_press</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467645/#Comment_467645" name="Item_526" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-13T11:22:03+00:00" title="November 13, 2017 11:22AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Magister Lor</b>: this is one of John Harper's Lady Blackbird variants, which perhaps got overshadowed by the subsequent Kickstarter for Blades in the Dark.

Sometimes it only takes one phrase to suggest a good GM response. Sometimes I collect various phrases that I feel have potential (I may move them around like a jigsaw puzzle), and then I look at their gestalt to extract a meaningful GM response from them. <br/><br/>I'm still evolving a method around getting hits from the tool, but the ideal is for me to intervene as little as possible. I try to look for things on the character sheet (or the game text itself) that can be used as a keyword, and hopefully that keyword returns phrases that suggest what the imaginary GM might do.  If I exhaust everything in the character sheet (or game text) without any good hits from the tool, I will then brainstorm keywords myself and see if I can get any useful hits that way. <br/><br/>This hasn't happened yet, but if get absolutely nothing useful from the tool and I can't come up with any keywords, I'll have to fall back on other oracular tools to formulate a GM response (and then try the whole process again when I need another GM response). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467682/#Comment_467682" name="Item_531" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-14T16:21:27+00:00" title="November 14, 2017  4:21PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great answer, thank you!

War is coming.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467797/#Comment_467797" name="Item_541" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T06:43:06+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  6:43AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of us from the Story Game Forums played our second session of <b>Dog Eat Dog</b> online. I really like the group; the players are very creative and the sessions are interesting and engaging. I\u2019m very impressed with <b>Dog Eat Dog</b>. It is designed very well and very elegantly. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy collaborative Story Games and have yet to play it. Story Games SLC started our first session of an <b>Apocalypse World</b> 2e game. We have a really great MC running it. We have opened things up a bit to include pretty much any type of indie RPG at SG SLC. Playing with all the indie RPG forms and design-spaces keeps things fresh, and helps to hit all the different tastes and preferences people bring to the table. Tonight I ran an old fashioned dungeon crawl, with some old friends, using <b>The Black Hack.</b> it does a fair job of imitating oldschool D&amp;D. I got some old friends into Story Gaming about six months ago and they have really taken to it. They wanted to try something more traditional so we\u2019re giving TBH a shot. I like my RPGs a little more interactive and collaborative so I think as the campaign goes on I will open things up and bring in some Story Game tricks. I haven\u2019t GMed much, so I\u2019m looking forward to the practice and the challenge. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467816/#Comment_467816" name="Item_542" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-18T20:02:33+00:00" title="November 18, 2017  8:02PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>Fantastic!

(I.e. "Shut up")<br/><br/>A few moments later, the DM sets up a battlemat and brings out a dragon miniature. It's not all that large a miniature, so the kid says, "Ha! That's definitely a young dragon, looks like!"<br/><br/>The DM grows angry and says, "That's it! Just because you can't leave well enough alone, it just became an ancient dragon!"<br/><br/>Awkward silence from everyone.<br/><br/>It never did come to a fight, so I don't know if he was serious or not.

For example, I just finished my last introduction scene (in time for the end of Solo Gaming Appreciation Month). <br/><br/>One of the takeaways is that emulating another player making a long narration (or emulating two players interacting with each other)  is more arduous than me controlling one side and the tool driving the other side.  When I control one side, it feels  much more interactive  (probably, kinda obvious to everyone except me!).  My input also helps to act as a glue between the automated bits to make it easier for a more coherent whole to emerge. <br/><br/>TLDR: the automation works more easily in smaller bits. <br/><br/>The game prep and intro scenes are here if anyone is interested: <a href="http://solorpggamer.blogspot.com/search/label/Remember Tomorrow" rel="nofollow">Remember Tomorrow: The Bartender, The Razor Girl, and The Artiste</a> (Bad pun on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468118/#Comment_468118" name="Item_556" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-01T20:37:40+00:00" title="December  1, 2017  8:37PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2017 9:00PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played a second session of <b>Apocalypse World</b> last night at Story Games SLC. It has been an extremely dark story (positively morally revolting), in almost every sense. I may do a writeup as I have no doubt it would be interesting to some, but it also may be a bit too disturbing for some as well. Tonight we are playing <b>Mongrel Lite</b>, designed by Story Games Forums\u2019 own Mongrel_GM; it is a very Traditional RPG reminiscent of <b>Gurps Lite</b> and is very Simulationist in the Trifold Model sense. The game\u2019s task resolution mechanic is traditional, however it is has a lot of grey area in terms of success gradation, (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, it gives tremendous amount of subjective and interpretive power to the GM\u2014it\u2019s a bit slippery in that sense\u2014so I hope Mongrel is feeling charitable tonight <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/>. I think it will be very effective at quickly separating good GMs, that arbitrate fairly and have a good feel for the social-dynamics and reading the mood of the group, from those GMs that need more work; luckily Mongrel is the first type. I also have an online game of <b>Dog Eat Dog</b> coming up, which I\u2019ve been playing with Story Games Forums\u2019 own Paul_T, David_Berg, and Demiurge, they are a talented group and I really enjoy playing with them. The story has been really creative and interesting so far and DED is an excellent game that I highly recommend. In truth, I\u2019ve been super busy and shouldn\u2019t be playing so much; my first summery of <b>House of Spiders</b> is due for its first studio critique by pretty much the best GMless designer in the business (left unnamed in case that\u2019s his preference), so I\u2019m hoping to get something that isn\u2019t too embarrassing or incomprehensible put together. The game is currently scattered among lose pages of unorganized notes that I\u2019ve yet to compile into a reasonablely coherent document and should have been playtested more thoroughly by this point. On the plus side, I think that it will be beneficial to catch any problems early\u2014to separate the wheat from the chaff\u2014before they get mixed up to the point that they become more difficult to separate. Anyway, I would really recommend playing <b>Dog Eat Dog</b>, if you get the chance. It has a very original and elegant design; it\u2019s very impressive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468120/#Comment_468120" name="Item_557" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-01T22:10:47+00:00" title="December  1, 2017 10:10PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2017 10:11PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff:<br/><br/>Indeed.

There were 6 scenes, and in each one, a different player was a semi-GM, as this was the scene focused on their PC's plotting. The final scene was an epic social conflict with the future of Madagascar and each of the PCs at stake, originally with three sides, and ultimately turning into everyone against the title character (also a PC), which is the only reason she didn't triumph. And actual history is amazingly weirder than fiction.<br/><br/>I also played a Lovecraftian game using PbtA mechanics. This was not tremulus. Instead of Sanity, it had two parts: Beyond as the ever rising score for knowing too much and Hold Fast as the defense against that sort of thing. This works really well for PbtA. Where it differs from core PbtA is that it's designed for taking a pre-existing scenario and running it, something which is -- well, not exactly antithetical to PbtA, but not exactly what I'd recommend. It worked fine here, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing this one developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468362/#Comment_468362" name="Item_562" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-09T21:16:25+00:00" title="December  9, 2017  9:16PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Night\xb4s Black Agents: We had a disaster session.

I was worried it was not going to be as smooth... and turns out that worry was unfounded. The play worked like a charm. It was a lovely experience.<br/><br/>Later in the week, I convinced some non-gamer friends to play <b>The Quiet Year</b>. I ended up removing about half the cards to make the game last less than 2 hours, and it worked fine. One of the players got a huge grin when she realized she could let her mind discover whatever she wanted on the map, like she was a kid playing pretend again. It made my day.

I got oohs and ahhs from the players as they moved their tokens around the map and got personalized viewpoints with shadows.

I convinced the FLGS to start a monthly Indie/Small Press RPG day event. My normal group was out of town for the holiday or otherwise occupied, but I pulled together my daughter, a local player I know who is into indie games, and a young couple who were looking for D&amp;D game and convinced them to give Masks a try.<br/><br/>I was a little worried that players who were only used to D&amp;D would be taken aback by the different nature of an apocalypse engine game. But actually, they took to it quite well. We ended up with.<br/>Apate - The Delinquent, played by my daughter, a mutant with Illusion and Emotion control powers.<br/>Mystic Storm - The Doomed. A genetic experiment with superior physique, body manipulation, and memory control powers. Her nemesis was her father, and she is being hunted by her father's secret project.<br/>Nighthawk - the Protoge. A clever lad, but his mentor "Dark Eagle" was a bit more Punisher than Batman, who advises him not to overhink problems.<br/>The Gadgeteer. Essentially a hawkeye type. Excited young hero who made Nighthawl's acquaintance before the group's first mission.<br/><br/>I ran in intro session that was a cross between Die Hard and the Dr. Who Raknoss Chrismas special. I used the character Nano from the Villainy deck. His father was a retired hero (one of the first powered armor heroes), but now headed up a robotics company that opened up a branch in Halcyon city. The players started at a Christmas ball thrown by Astro Robotics, and was there for the fun when the Santa-and-Elf themed robots turned against the guests.<br/><br/>The new players like the session enough that they seemed interested in returning next months for a round two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468607/#Comment_468607" name="Item_592" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-24T12:51:05+00:00" title="December 24, 2017 12:51PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got to play <b>Troublemakers</b> again, this time taking on the role of a Kook whose Heirloom was an authentic 1980's Walkman that she was convinced also picked up ghostly voices.<br/><br/>Myself and two other kids (a Daredevil and a Knuckle) got a lift to a realm <b>Fearsome Critters</b> in an ice-cream van driven by Bigfoot; after an arrest and escape, we made it back home again but with no evidence of our big adventure to show the adults.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gragoon" title="Gragoon"><img alt="Gragoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gragoon">Gragoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468643/#Comment_468643" name="Item_593" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-29T14:42:20+00:00" title="December 29, 2017  2:42PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got to play <b>Eden</b>.
