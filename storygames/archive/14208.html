So much fun.<br/><br/>Let's see... first long series was a "Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern" thing with the PCs running around behind the scenes during the trilogy, mostly from after the death star blew up until around Han getting frozen. At one point, a Hutt boss had hired them to steal "some rare materials" for him, and they ended up on Cloud City and realized they're supposed to steal carbonite.<br/><br/>Second series was about a bounty hunter crew operating during the rise of the Empire (first death star still under construction). That was a very Firefly-esque game, thinking back on it (this was oh, 1990 maybe?). A mission-based thing that was mostly about the crew figuring out how to trust each other (or not).<br/><br/>Third series was straight up military style, with the PCs as Rebel soldiers fighting in the war against the Empire. That also used the films as a major backdrop, but the events of the game were much smaller-scale, about those dudes you see on Hoth running around in the trenches and getting blown up by AT-ATs.<br/><br/>Fourth series was totally Jedi focused, during the period (we imagined) that Darth Vader was hunting down the last surviving members of the order.<br/><br/>Much, much later, I ran a short series (Star Wars d20) about a Jedi master, his promising young student, and her twin brother, who had become a more powerful force user, but was not raised in the Jedi ways. That was set during the old republic era, and was also our attempt at "doing the prequels right." (Didn't everyone do that?) It was pretty great. I've considered writing that one up as a playset, Lady Blackbird style.

It was great. I think my lack of experience just lead to games where we smashed the canon and I barely reigned in the characters. But that was ok. I never planned out stories, and even to this day I can't really do that. The story had the feel of the Giffen (spelling?) era of JLA, with a good chunk of humor. Jedi characters were rare and we never had more than one. Not by choice, but that's just how it happened. <br><br>I do have to say that we did have one Star Wars expert in the group (he edits Wookiepedia now) who would fill in color or details when we needed them, but he never pointed out when we clashed with the established storyline. Maybe he didn't care; I sure didn't. <br><br>This was all pre-prequels. <br><br/>AS FOR YOUR QUESTION:<br/><br/>Basically, I tried to figure out what the characters wanted to do and just let them do it, all the while trying to come up with a reason for them to be together. When I thought of a cool obstacle/thing/npc to throw at them, I did. I never tried to kill or defeat them.

It means you can take as much from westerns and men's adventure novels as you can stand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322404/#Comment_322404" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T13:20:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  1:20PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HISTORY PANIC!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322408/#Comment_322408" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T14:13:11+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  2:13PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>I feel really constrained creatively when I imagine sitting down to play a Star Wars RPG. I'd feel the same about Lord of the Rings, too, I think.<br/>Has anyone else experienced this and found a way to get around it?<br/>I'm concerned I'd feel like any character I made would just be glaringly outside of existing continuity.</blockquote>\nI'd have a problem with Lord of the Rings, just because I feel there's so much that hasn't really been covered about what happened before and after the books/movies...at least without being well-versed in the series.<br/>Star Wars, on the other hand, I've always found to be a breeze to run. I've played it since the first iteration of the D6 system, all the way up through the D20 Saga version, with a few home-brewed and hacked versions in-between.<br/>The strength of Star Wars is that the movies, novels, and comics are all covering only a portion of the events going on. There's SO MUCH going on in the background, all you have to do is take a portion of that, and use it for a game. If you get around to reading any of the novels, a great way to start would be with the Tales of the Bounty Hunters or any of the X-Wing series. Secondary, and even minor "who the hell are these guys" characters get their chance to shine.<br/>You just need to remember that the Star Wars galaxy is an expansive place, and there's lots of stuff to do that would probably never bring PCs into contact with any canon characters. And even if you don't know much about the Star Wars galaxy, just grab the Star Wars Atlas (for quick planet names and references), and then just run some game based on a western/samurai/suspense/action/car-racing/etc. film, and flavor it with blasters and spaceships. You won't go wrong.<br/><br/>My favorite campaign involved a Rodian and Togorian bounty hunter, with an NPC Jawa as their mechanic, just wandering around, taking bounties, and running into complications with local law enforcement, Hutt gangsters, and occasionally the Empire. Later, they added a former Tie Fighter pilot to their team, and would just go wherever the whim took them. And since this was back when Thermal Detonators were, mechanically, still deadly (a.k.a. old D6 version), there were many interesting incidents involving "make-it-better pills" (their nickname for thermal detonators), a bunch of Ubese mercenaries, and the pipes of natural gas running underneath the streets of a back-water planet. Good fun, that. Not once did they have to deal with Jedi, Sith, any of the Skywalkers, Solos, or Calrissians (even though this was the Rebellion era), and everything went swimmingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322409/#Comment_322409" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T14:13:43+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  2:13PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JOHNZO!

For Jedi-lite campaigns, D6 did it well...particularly if you didn't want to encourage people to be Jedi. Powers meant sacrificing your other abilities, and could be a bugger to use. But when you trained in them, you did get the feel of the movies, since you really weren't limited by the power itself, but your own inner strength and connection with others.<br/>The D20 versions were always too overpowered, in my opinion. It was EASIER to be a Jedi, and you didn't run the risk of cutting off your own hand with your lightsaber, but they made the Force powers too much like spells. The D20 Saga version was a little better, but all powers were essential combat-oriented (since this was when they were about to release 4E), and we had to hack non-combat uses for things.<br/><br/>If, perchance, you go the route of the D6 rules, the easiest thing I've found (and this was a hack from long ago, so the details are a bit fuzzy now) was to have a new attribute called "Force," which essentially took the place of the "Force Sensitive" option. If you had at least one die in the Force, you had a sensitivity to the Force, and could be trained in Force powers. The Force powers were essentially skills, like Move Object, Telepathy, Regeneration, etc., that added their dice to the Force attribute, and the dice rolls were adjusted by the modifiers for weight/distance/relationship, as necessary. It makes it a bit easier than having the original Control, Sense, and Alter abilities, and having powers be some combination of the three.<br/><br/>I may have to dig up my old notes some time and post them on my blog, for posterity sake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322430/#Comment_322430" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-30T16:36:09+00:00" title="April 30, 2011  4:36PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main problem with d6 Jedi is, as the game progressed, it became less and less useful to have anyone else along other than Jedi.

The few Jedi or Jedi-wannabees I had to deal with were typically focused on their powers and lightsaber training, whereas the other characters could focus on abilities that were more useful for everything else. Sure, in a fight a Jedi was a great thing to have, but they were rarely the better pilot, or the better mechanic, or the better diplomat. Their powers certainly helped, but the players never tried to use them too often, since they did not want to rely too much on the Force. The Force was their ally, not their tool.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have had so much problem with the Saga version if they did Force powers like skills, with various ways for a Jedi to use them, instead of like effect-specific spells.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322500/#Comment_322500" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-01T08:35:35+00:00" title="May  1, 2011  8:35AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I would like to do someday, is to take an established character from the movies that you don't know too much about, like Jettster Dexter, and have a few adventures with him and a crew of new characters. Like <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dexter_Jettster" rel="nofollow">Jettter Dexter</a>.<br/><br/>You play in a time set before Episode One. I would perhaps disregard whatever they say on Wookiepedia. He has a single scene in Episode 2. You learn he's been prospecting on Subterrelit is implied it is but one of many jobs, adventures. He met Kaminoans and saw a saber-dart. He befriended Obi-Wan at some point. He's well-travelled, knows a lot of thing, which is why Obi-Wan comes to him for information. By Episode II, he owns a diner.<br/><br/>The first story I would like to tell would be about Jettster prospecting on Subterrel. He has dealings with Kaminoans there. Perhaps they have a mine as well. Trouble is brewing. Maybe there is a workers' union on Subterrel, and they resent the use of clone workers. Sabotage is done. Union men are killed by saber-darts in retaliation. Jettster, as an outsider to the conflict, is called on to arbitrate. <br/><br/>Other characters could be fellow prospectors. That's not a very restrictive requirement. Think of the Gold Rush : anyone could become a prospector if they wanted to. They don't have to be part of the cannon. In any case, I figure that in the end he sells his mine and goes on to other adventures, perhaps with the other prospectors.<br/><br/>At some point after that, it's perfectly legitimate to introduce a young Obi-Wan+Qui-Gon, or Obi-Wan+Anakin, as guest stars or as player-characters, to play out the burgeoning friendship.<br/><br/>You can end the campaign any time, the the nice spot is when Jettster buys his diner and finally settles down.<br/><br/>Of course, you could decide to play out the events going on between Episode III and IV. Perhaps Jettster comes out of retirement, reassembles his old crew and... then what? Nobody knows, (if you ignore Wookieepedia!) and so you are free to find out!<br/><br/>(Even if you choose not to ignore Wookieepedia, there are still gaps wide enough to hold a game in them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
