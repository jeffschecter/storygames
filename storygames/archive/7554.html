The fault is that the lamination on the cover stock has been mis-applied, leading to the covers curling over time. As far as I'm concerned, this means that we have been providing a product that is below the quality that I would be happy selling, sub-standard in fact. This covers copies sold by ourselves and IPR up to 1st September. This includes stock sold at Gen Con.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've emailed everyone who has purchased a copy of either game from ourselves or IPR to let them know about this and offer some small form of compensation by way of apology. A good number of people have already got back in touch, which is great. However that still leaves people who might not have seen the email or who might have purchased either book at Gen Con.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have bought Hot War or Cold City online, then please check your spam filter or trash box! If you bought the game at Gen Con, then please whisper back to me in this thread and I'll get you sorted out with our Compensation Package. That makes it sound rather grand, which it isn't really. It involves something of a refund.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can assure everyone that we've taken this up with our printers and that pristine, non-curling copies of Hot War and Cold City 1.1 are winging their way to ourselves and IPR. Hot War will be the first one to re-stock, hopefully tomorrow if the UPS racking system is to be believed!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I'd like to apologise for this and hope that this does not reduce your enjoyment of our games.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167776/#Comment_167776" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T13:37:01+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  1:37PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I have been happy with my copy, so it must have come before the books were exposed to the left over Nazi-era Quantum Generators that you have over there. <br>\n<br>\nReally now Malcolm, if the books have been irradiated by the Stasi to track double agents you should just tell us.
