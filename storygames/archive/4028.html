The demos were quite successful and enjoyable, so I thought that I'd formally thank the designers who were brave enough to allow their names to be dragged through the mud repeatedly:<br/><br/>Vincent Baker<br/>Andy Kitkowski<br/>Ben Lehman<br/>Jason Morningstar<br/>Matt Snyder<br/><br/>Plus a special thank you to Ralph Mazza, my murder victim.<br/><br/>Running the demo was a hoot.  Sometimes, I'd get people who knew some of the designers involved, but it was even funnier to play with people who had never met any of the designers.  The cognitive dissonance between the actions in the game and what I actually know of the designers was hilarious.<br/><br/>I also managed to get each designer (except Vincent Baker) to play through the demo.  Sadly, Vincent and I couldn't quite get our schedules to line up.<br/><br/><br/>Best memories:<br/><br/>Watching Alexis play Ben, while Ben was at the table.<br/><br/>Having the investigator kick in the door of the stall of the men's room where Jason Morningstar was...occupied.<br/><br/>Someone stabbing Ben through the Forge backdrop with a sword.<br/><br/>Discovering that Matt Snyder is a seedy jiujitsu master.<br/><br/>Finding out that Ben Lehman is a closet Warhammer 40K player.<br/><br/><br/>Again, thanks for your willingness to be a part of this!<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90083/#Comment_90083" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T07:58:07+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  7:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All weekend I had people running up to me and saying "You bastard!
