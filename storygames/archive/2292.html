                    If you're playing a game where the main question is "How does your character change today, what do they become?" then the adversity that the GM provides should (I think!) be about trying to make them become something other.<br/>
<br/>
Having done some playtests, I will say that it is hard to get that across if you don't have an in-character agent who is deliberately pursuing that goal.  In the same way that <i>DitV</i> is easier when you ask "What does this character want the Dogs to do or decide?" I suspect that <i>Misery Bubblegum</i> will be easier when I ask "What does this character want protagonist X to <i>become</i>?"<br/>
<br/>
But I have only a fuzzy, unexamined sense of what motivates person A to want to make person B into something other than what they were this morning.  I can give specific instances (you are vying with Jesse for a limited resource (say, the love of Eddie) and that motivates you to want her to be a bad person), but I don't have any words for the overall pattern.  And, until I have those words, it's going to be very hard for me to code that pattern into an NPC generator that lets the GM make NPCs that will, by their nature, provide the right adversity for the protagonists.<br/>
<br/>
So ... why do people <i>do</i> this?  Why does a girlfriend want to "discover" that her boyfriend is secretly a romantic (i.e. change who he explicitly is by either bringing forward hidden traits or inventing the traits wholesale)?  Why does a bitter man want to make naive and happy people bitter like him?  Why does a wise soul want to help others find redemption?                </div>

                            If you accept that people are interested in validating their beliefs, then one way of framing the NPC's motivations towards a character is that they want the PC to prove them right.  "Hiroko's teacher always wants her to prove that she's serious about gymnastics, because he believes that you don't deserve to succeed unless you're serious about something."                        </div>

                            Do you think there's just one motivation? It seems to me that there are good reasons to want to change a person (like a teacher who sees great potential in an underachiever) and bad reasons to want to change a person (like one popular girl wanting to make another popular girl into an outcast).                        </div>

                            Tony, I'm not sure, these are great questions worth exploring.<br><br>On the Nasty Example, that sounds possibly like validation. Brining others to your level or lower in any given category validates your own position in a relative sense. <br><br>On the Nice Example, sounds like if there is hope for others, then maybe there is hope for me. Or maybe it is an issue of self worth, I'm not going to make it, but I can make sure you do and also know that I'm worth something in the process. Or maybe by ensuring your success, I am making myself a part of it. <br><br>That's all very cynical of me! Hahahaha. That's what happens when I've been on 4 straight conference calls for the last 3 hours!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Adam:  I do not think there is one <i>specific</i> motivation.  Rather, I suspect that there are many.<br/>
<br/>
But there may well be some <i>general</i> class into which these motivations fall.  I don't think that all motivations fit.  For instance, it is very hard for me to imagine the case where I want to prove that somebody is really cheating on his girlfriend and my motivation for that is "I'm hungry."  I'm sure you can come up with a chain of motivations that leads from point A to point B, but I suspect it's going to be a little bit <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" rel="nofollow">Rube Goldberg</a>.                        </div>

                            I just mean that if you're making some step-by-step process for creating NPCs, it sounds as though it's somewhat similar to the town-creation process for Dogs, and if you start from pride, then, well... yeah. But I think that NPCs wanting to change people to validate themselves is pretty close to starting from pride. <br><br>But I guess there's also the flip side of starting from the fear that <i>you aren't enough,</i> and you have to make other people confirm that you <i>are </i>enough. That's not pride-motivated, exactly. But it's related to status.                        </br></br></div>

                            You want a word that speaks to why character X wants character Y to change? I think that's going to have to be somewhat of a synthetic term, since it's so specific here.<br/>
<br/>
The simplest would be: Change Motive<br/>
<br/>
But that could apply to oneself. How about : Alteration Impetus<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that there's one general urge to try to change other people. In fact, given that it's really hard to actually change another person, I think that people generally don't try. Hardly ever. What's happening in these examples, in fact, aren't really being thought of by the changer as changes. That is, the changer doesn't really care if you become X, they really only want whatever their motive is. To that extent, it's fine with them if you simply temporarily engage in the behavior they need to you engage in. Which may constitute a change in a moral sense to some extent, but isn't what people think of as a change on a day to day basis.<br/>
<br/>
If I make an exception to my moral code, and steal a small item, sure, on one level I've changed. I've become a person who has now made this one exception. But often exceptions prove the rule. If I then feel guilty for my infraction, have I really changed? That is, as a predictor of future action, am I now more or less prone to the behavior in question? That can't be answered merely by looking at the act in question, but if you changed internally in response.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, that was fun stealing - I think I'll drop that rule against it, and steal all the time now!"<br/>
"Oh, that sucked, stealing - I vow never to do it again."<br/>
<br/>
A person who tries to get you to steal isn't trying to get either of these particular outcomes. They just want you to steal. So their motive isn't to change you, it's to do X. Which happens, in this case, to be a catalyst for change, sure. But you shouldn't probably call it a Change Motive. Instead you could call it something like Change Catalyst Motive.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are exceptions. My wife harps on me doing the dishes in more timely fashion in an ever ongoing campaign to change me into somebody who does the dishes in a more timely fashion without having to be bugged into doing them. So actual "Change Motives" do exist. I just think that they're pretty rare, and that mostly what a person wants is just to have clean dishes. My wife would be satisfied if I increased my income and got a maid to do the dishes (if such a thing exists).<br/>
<br/>
So I think that the "adversity" that creates can create these changes is simply serendipitous. That in most cases, there's really no direct motive to change a person. Even if it's validation, again, all the person wants is to be able to look at the other person and say, "See, you stole once, I'm not bad for stealing." They don't need the other person to become a thief for validation (though it might be extremely validating for that to happen). In fact a person might be horrified to learn in validating their own rules that they've changed a person into something unintentionally. "Oh, I just wanted you to steal once! I never thought you'd turn into a full-time theif!"<br/>
<br/>
Being as the motives may have more to do with eliciting a short-term behavior, and not be intended to produce a permanent change (though they might, in fact, do that even on a small scale), I think you don't have a single nameable type of motive. As such, you're going to have to make up a name.<br/>

                            So, Mike and John ... I'm not sold on the idea that everything reduces down to being about what it does for the person who desires the change.<br/>
<br/>
I'll grab an example from <i>Better off Dead</i>:  Lane is a complete and total loser.  He really is!  He spends substantial portions of the movie <i>failing</i> suicide attempts in various slapstick ways.  Monique is a charming, beautiful, confident girl who likes him, and believes in him.  He is at the end of his rope, ready to give up his dreams (small though they are) and just slog through life, and she says one of the great lines of encouragement I've ever heard:  "I think all you need is a small taste of success, and you will find it suits you."<br/>
<br/>
I don't see that Monique gets anything <i>for herself</i> by changing Lane this way.  Or if she does, it's <i>so</i> indirect.  I think that she believes the world would be a better place if he became the person he wants to be, and so she tries to make it happen.                        </div>

                            There is a cynical argument that there is no such thing as an altruistic act.  In goes like this: helping people makes you feel good about having helped someone.  Thus since you have received the reward of feeling good, the act was not altruistic.  You did it for the feeling of having done good not solely for the other persons good.  <br>
<br>
Not an attitude I personally subscribe to, but it fits the model of reducing motivations down to what the person gets out of the change.  They try to change people for the better because they get joy and satisfaction out of seeing a person become better.                        </br></br></div>

                            I've gotten a bit of benefit here, in the past hour or so, from mentally turning on my head and looking at this question from a different angle.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of asking "Is it 'pride' to help someone out with no direct benefit to yourself?", I've been thinking "If I tell people to think of something motivated by 'pride', will that word lead them to help someone out with no direct benefit to themselves?"  And I tend to think that, no, most people wouldn't go from that starting point to that ending point.<br/>
<br/>
So, is there some place that you can start people which will be specific enough to inspire them, but general enough to prompt them to equally consider both extremes (as well as the rich middle ground):  the selfish changing of people in order to validate yourself and the selfless changing of people in order to help them?                        </div>

                            I obviously posted too long. My point was not that the motives can all be so reduced, but that, in fact, there is no one reason for why people will do things that will change others, and so there's no use looking for the label for it.<br/>
<br/>
I mean what about when the person is doing something and doesn't realize that they've created a situation that might change the other person? In my hypothetical, what if the "changer" doesn't know that your character doesn't like to steal? And asks them to steal for them? They've no intent to change the character at all, but are providing the "adversity" to create the change.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I think that the whole "adversity" idea is just off here. There are completely positive things that can get out there that can change a person. Uh, a character is in need of help. The PC, normally unhelpful, helps. That's not adversity, but still a character providing some reason to change.<br/>
<br/>
Or are you only interested in when negative things cause people to change?<br/>

Because, I mean a change in the fictional sense.  A character starts out as nothing, and then as things are exposited those traits get attached to them in the fiction.  Those may or may not be things that they are in the "reality" of the fiction.<br><br>Like, the murderer in an Agatha Christie novel is the murderer from the get-go, in the reality that supposedly underlies the fiction.  But they only become the murderer in the fiction itself when the story says that they're the murderer.  Indeed, they may spend the beginning of the story definitely <b>not</b> the murderer if the exposition concentrates on their alibi and attitudes in a way that deliberately misleads the audience.<br><br>So if an NPC wants to "change" a character into being a Geek, that doesn't mean that they have to change all the ways that character behaves.  It would be far sweeter (most likely) to reveal that the character has always <i>been</i> a Geek, and now everybody knows.  The point is to change the fiction, whether that requires changing the actual character or not.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            So, much as I love Bill's formulation, there are all kinds of things that it doesn't cover.  Sometimes people want to convince other people of things that they <b>know</b> will not be to the benefit of the person being convinced.  I'm gonna generalize it out, and see what people think:<br/>
<br/>
The belief is that a first person (the favorite) will benefit if a second person (the target) is Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
The favorite and the target could well be the same person:  Lane will benefit if Lane proves to be someone with a talent for success.<br/>
<br/>
The favorite and the target could be different people:  Heather will benefit if Veronica doesn't have the nerve to defy her.<br/>
<br/>
The favorite could be the person acting to foment the change, but doesn't have to be:  Ryouga believes that Akane will benefit if Ranma is shown to be an unsuitable husband, and nothing is going to stop him from helping her in that way!<br/>
<br/>
Things start to trend out of NPC territory when the target is the NPC acting to foment the change:  Lois will benefit if Clark is shown to be just a mild mannered reporter ... and Clark is the one doing the showing.  It's not that those aren't good stories, but my sense is that the whole "I need to be seen a certain way" deal is protagonist territory.<br/>
<br/>
I know that's ... broad.  Very, very broad.  Does it sound comprehensive, though?  If I start narrowing things down from there, will I at least <i>start</i> having not left anything out?                        </div>

                            Hey Tony, I want to ask you exactly what you're looking for, in terms of an end-state mechanic.  If I'm reading you correctly, you want a rule for NPC creation that makes them into the type of person that will try to get the protagonists to change, without the GM needing a boatload of insight into the human animal or whatever.  Do you have a specific format in mind, like the hierarchy of sin from DitV, or the Praxis scales from Shock?<br/>
<br/>
Because it seems to me like you've already achieved one possibly workable solution.  Here in this thread we've seen a couple of "Mad Libs" type statements, each of which presents a possible format of desires.  You could present a list of them in the character creation chapter, with guidelines like, for example, "Minor NPCs have none, significant NPCs have 1 or 2, major NPCs have 3-5."  If that's acceptable, then it's not so much a case of narrowing down to one broad overarching principle, so much as hammering out a condensed list of, say, 10 or so fill-in-the-blank statements.                        </div>

<p>Permit me to change the viewpoint and spout a little psychobabble in the process, but only because I think it would be insightful.</p>
<p>I remember reading that Eric Berne (the father of Transactional Analysis and script theory) believed that people are looking for other people to become actors in their life scripts. In particular, he thought that children grow up believing they should recreate their parent's relationships, as they understand them, casting themselves in the role of the parent they feel most similar to, and seeking out partners who resemble either the other parent, or the partners their role model sought out. Children of alcoholic parents seek out alcoholics or become alcoholics, switching roles if necessary. Children of abusive parents become abusive parents, or seek a mate who will become abusive. It's not necessarily masochism; sometimes it's just seeking out the familiar, other times it's a misguided attempt to prove the original relationship was fixable.</p>
<p>Now, ditch the psychobabble and generalize it: when two people form a relationship, they think of it in terms of a relationship they remember seeing before. It could be their parents' relationship, or their mother's relationship with a sibling, or even one of their own relationships, or an idealized relationship from a book or movie. So, Teacher X sees Student Y, who reminds her of herself as a young child; Teacher X recasts herself as her own mother and tries to "fix" the old relationship by becoming a better version of her mother, either by taking her mother's goals as her own and succeeding where she failed, or by being the mother she wished her own mother had been. Either way, the teacher has a script written out for Student Y that Student Y might not want to play a part in; maybe she doesn't want to be Teacher-Y-as-a-little-girl.</p>
<p>Student Y may also meet Boy Z, who's a little older than her. Boy Z reminds Student Y of her older brother, whom she was fiercely competitive with, and so begins to relive that relationship, trying to beat her "older brother". But maybe Boy Z looks at Student Y and thinks about a romance in some movie, and tries to recast the relationship as <em>that</em> script. At best, the two are going to interpret each other's actions as fulfilling the script they're following; at worst, neither one will live up to the other's expectations.</p>
<p>What you might be able to distill out of this is a way to frame an NPC's desires for what they want a PC to become in terms of <em>who the NPC becomes</em> when the PC reminds the NPC of someone else.</p>

This sounds promising to me -- it might be easier to start at the end, so to speak, and then work backwards with developing motivations.                        </div>

I'm not sure whether that's what you were implying.  I tried it that way, and I think that coding it into the NPC's personality makes it much easier on the GM.  Yes, it means that the NPC cannot be suddenly rewritten ... but if you do this right in the first place, why would you need to rewrite them during the course of a one hour session?<br><br>The benefit (and the one that <i> shows so well with its Town Creation system) is that once you have all of the behavior of the <i>system</i> you want in place coded into the <i>characters</i> you're ready to play then you can <b>just play</b>.  Playing the characters with integrity will always be the same thing as driving that system in the ways you built it to be driven.  So you've got easy access to the problem from two angles.<br><br>If I just say "I want Edward to loosen up and be less of a stick in the mud" then I have to figure out at every turn "Why would Shary want to do something to make Edward less of a stick in the mud?"  Until I figure that out, I can't just do the first thing that comes to mind that Shary "would do," because it might run directly counter to my goals.<br><br>By contrast, if I say "Shary finds Edward's stuck up attitude amusing, and wants to show that deep down he can be a party animal like everyone else," then I don't have to think as hard.  Edward comes in saying "Tut, tut ... such brash behavior, Ms. Ventura," and Shary staggers over, flops a limp arm around his shoulders, loosens his tie and presses a beer on him.  "Oh, Eddie," she says, "Yer funny.  Have a drink!  Lighten up!"  That's the first thing I come up with that she would do, and I no longer have to think about any of the rest of it, because <i>everything</i> she could possibly do (without violating her integrity as a character) is going to fit with my goals.</br></br></br></br></i> </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>What you might be able to distill out of this is a way to frame an NPC's desires for what they want a PC to become in terms of<em>who the NPC becomes</em>when the PC reminds the NPC of someone else.</blockquote>Oh.  That's nice.  You could code it not in terms of what they want the PC to be, but what they want the "NPC+PC" pair to be.  Instead of saying "Who do you want Pete to become?" you say "What type of pair do you want 'You and Pete' to become?"<br><br>It's not simply "Ryouga wants Ranma to be a jerk," or even "Ryouga knows that Akane will be happier if she realizes Ranma is a jerk," it's "Ryouga wants 'Ryouga and Ranma' to be 'The nice guy who treats Akane right, and the jerk she was with before.' "<br><br>It's not "Monique wants Lane to be confident and successful," it's "Monique wants 'Monique and Lane' to be 'Two free and happy kids who can make her trip to America into a time where dreams come true for both of them.' "<br><br>The boyfriend who shuts his girlfriend up at every turn doesn't <b>want</b> her to be miserable and withdrawn.  He just wants to create the "Strong man and admiring woman" relationship that makes his world complete.<br><br>Okay, I like this notion <b>a lot</b>.  I think it's got legs, as a way of inspiring people to make awesome NPCs.  It codes their motivation right into the way you describe what they want to achieve ... and it inherently makes them vulnerable to rejection by the PCs.  You can't <i>write</i> a motivation in this system that doesn't have the potential to backfire on someone.  If the boyfriend ends up as half of "Abusive jerk ex-boyfriend and the girl who's learned better" then he's hurting <b>big time</b>.  He's NOT THAT GUY!  He's the strong man, not the abusive jerk.  You can't make him be that guy!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Follow-up:  I used this to prep for a game last night, and I like the results.<br/>
<br/>
Cassandra (the PC) is a moody, emotionally crippled young girl (yes, those who know my friends know that I was playing with Sydney).  She had, in a previous game, done all sorts of terrible things to Jessica, a sweet young kid who just wanted to be friends.  So this time Cassandra wanted to somehow make it up to Jessica ... WITH CUNNING PLANS!  She would escape the school and go to the mall, there to find The Perfect Gift which would be so awesome that, once presented to Jessica, it would force her against her will to sincerely forgive Cassandra.<br/>
<br/>
I made up a new NPC, Lucrezia, who was a goth-rebel-angst-monkey.  I decided that she wanted "Lucrezia and Cassandra" to be "Two misfits who are superior to the stupid mundanes."  From that point on, things got very easy.  Just playing Lucrezia as written was constantly jamming Cassandra up against the questions she needed to be asking herself.  Like, Lucrezia helped her break out of school (setting most of it on -fire- in the process), and that was cool.  Cassandra liked that.  Cassandra liked the teamwork, and having somebody who liked her for her strangeness.  The role that Lucrezia wanted her to play out was attractive.<br/>
<br/>
But then, when Cassandra wanted to go to the mall to try to find The Perfect Apology Gift for Jessica, Lucrezia was very down on the idea.  "Look, this Jessica girl, she's ... NORMAL.  You don't want to hang out with her.  You're better than that.  Besides, you'll never make her happy.  She won't understand you."  It was lovely and horrific, because both Sydney and Cassandra had to concede the truth of every single statement, but still ... Cassandra didn't want to be that person.  She wanted to change into a person who would no longer easily fit into Lucrezia's image of the two, and so they were just naturally tugging back and forth every time they talked.<br/>
<br/>
I think that I got that <i>conflict</i> by luck and/or intuition.  I could just as easily have made NPCs who wanted her to fill roles all of which she could easily reconcile, and then the magic wouldn't have occurred.  So there's still some stuff missing here, but I think it's on the right track.                        </div>

                            You might want to take it in the direction of Hero's Banner, then.  In other words, hard code it into the mechanics so that a number of the relationships are mutually exclusive.  Make sure that the character can't have their cake and eat it too.  I'm not sure whether a better approach would be to just make a rule, "The NPCs' desires for the characters must be largely mutually incompatible," or to actually hammer out some mechanical doodad so that it's actually <i>impossible</i> to choose more than a certain number of roles to change into/take on within, say, a session, or a story arc.                        </div>
