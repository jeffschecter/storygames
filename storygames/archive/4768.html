I tried to write examples, but with each one, I had to write at least one paragraph that setup the context of the example. Using both halves of my brain like that made the whole thing go really slowly.<br/><br/>So I thought it'd be best to write a running example throughout the text, using the same cast of characters. Ryan Macklin suggested that it may be more fruitful to turn to actual play to create this cast rather than making them up on my own. This seems like a great idea considering character creation is kind of its own little group exercise.<br/><br/>Here is a synopsis of the game's premise:\n<blockquote>You and your friends play flying monks on a pilgrimage. You'll be traveling through a universe of open sky, visiting little planets with unusual cultures and people. Someone from each world has written a letter to your temple asking for help with a conflict or crisis. The temple elders give a stack of these letters to young monks who have reached an age where they must decide whether to remain in the temple or continue helping people on the worlds outside. In the short term, it's your job to resolve each crisis. In the long term, you'll be discovering your true path in life.<br/><br/>Key Terms: Coming of Age, Road Trip, Wuxia, Amish Rumspringa, Tibetan Buddhism</blockquote>\nCharacter creation is actually the beginning of play, in the same vein as Spirit of the Century. You'll be playing your characters introducing themselves and explaining their key characteristics. Here's the context of this little ritual:\n<blockquote>You and a small group of monks have been called forth to a council of the temple elders. Incense wafts through the high ceilings and the aged men and women hover in the lotus position above silk pillows. You're finally ready to go on a pilgrimage to the worlds outside, but you must first go through a ritual where you'll choose your new pilgrim name and come to learn more about your new companions.</blockquote>\nThe whole process is broken down into three steps. First, there is an independent portion where you make your character on your own. This is followed by a group-creation portion where you describe memories of the other characters, thereby establishing some of their attributes. The final step involves summarizing the key parts of all these writings into character stats.<br/><br/>I'll need four or five participants. Ryan says he's down, are there any other volunteers?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

This is meant for you to reflect on your past before moving on to the future. Everyone comes to the temple for different reasons and with different histories. Let's hear about yours.<br/><br/><b>"Before you take on your new pilgrim name, what name did you have before joining the temple?"</b><br/>This is your original name, which can be just any regular name like Max or Shirley. If your character comes from an unusual culture or background, this can also be reflected in the name.\n<blockquote>Examples: Max Adams, Sofia Alana Mattar Panduranan, RX-1, Zeus, Poobler, "the Kid."</blockquote>\n<b>"Who do you miss most from home?"</b><br/>This is a parent, friend, pet or some other person with whom your character has a bond. Describe the nature of this relationship briefly and why you miss them.\n<blockquote>Sofia Alana Mattar Panduranan misses her father: I miss father. He would always be so quick to break up the fights that my brother Malal and I would get into. No one does that for us now, which makes it really difficult to tell when I've gone too far with our quarrels.<br/><br/>The Kid misses the police: I miss the police. I miss being chased through the bazaar after I steal some bread. The market police were bigger and faster, but they didn't know the city like us. Sure, it was a rough way to live, but you can't choose your childhood.<br/><br/>Max Adams misses his mom: I miss my mom and dad and my dog Buddy. They're probably having pancakes right now.</blockquote>\n<b>"Why did you join the temple? Be completely honest."</b><br/>Everyone who becomes a monk at the temple does so for different reasons. What are yours?\n<blockquote>Sofia Alana Mattar Panduranan: Father wants Malal and I to take over the temple from the inside, but I would rather see House Panduranan stay just the way I remember it. Father already had so little time for us to begin with, I can't imagine how busy he will be as emperor of the known worlds. So, I hope to keep my brother's machinations in check.<br/><br/>The Kid: We <i>knew</i> the city, but they <i>controlled</i> the city. One by one, my whole gang got nicked until it was just me cutting purses and stealing apples. Sooner or later, I'd be sent to the orphanage, too. If it's gotta happen, I figured it would be better to be sent away to the place of my own choosing.<br/><br/>Max Adams: I was out in the woods with Buddy when we smelled smoke. Buddy led the way back home, but I tripped on a tree root. Everything was thick and black when I suddenly felt myself leave the ground. I opened my eyes and saw a gigantic forest fire below me. I was being carried by a flying girl with purple hair. She set me down in the backyard, said something about a dragon on the loose from another world, then flew back into the fire. My parents snatched me away and we drove to a shelter, but I decided on that day that I would help save other people and see those other worlds.</blockquote>\n<b>"Finally, what test did you pass to enter the temple?"</b><br/>Before entering the temple, being accepted as a monk, you had to pass a test. This test was crafted specifically for you, even if you didn't know it was a test at the time. Describe some rite of passage or display of worthiness that you had to go through in order to be initiated. This is an opportunity for you to describe your character's most noteworthy attributes, interests or background.\n<blockquote>Sofia Alana Mattar Panduranan: Malal believes I proved my worthiness by taking care of the temple's livestock, just as he did. In truth, I was accepted because I revealed my father's plot. I am still confused about why they accepted <i>him</i> even though they knew he is a spy for our family.<br/><br/>The Kid: The police were fed up with me, so they decided to call in the big guns. The pilgrims flew in at sunrise and by dinner time, I stole each one of their hearts with the "pitiful orphan" act. The pilgrims offered to take me back with them and the police were more than happy to see me go.<br/><br/>Max Adams: My life was pretty normal. I couldn't think of anything I could do that the temple would find impressive. I could do one thing really well: Color. I grabbed my best crayons and whitest paper and wrote a letter to the temple asking to join. Then I clipped it to my pajamas, figuring that wherever the letter went, it would carry me along. It worked!</blockquote>\nThus ends the first step in becoming a pilgrim. The second step will be detailed after everyone writes their stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paulie" title="Paulie"><img alt="Paulie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paulie">Paulie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107394/#Comment_107394" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T09:46:03+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  9:46AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am interested but unfortunately too late. =-(                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107397/#Comment_107397" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T10:02:10+00:00" title="November  8, 2007 10:02AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Original name</b>: <ul><li>Marcus Quinctius Lupus</li></ul>\n<b>Who do I miss most from home?</b><ul><li>I miss my mother, who would always have another book for me to read.

They were, as most people are, kind and -- thanks to the kingdom's prosperity and my father's generosity  -- rather carefree.  The loves to put on parades and parties, and with each birthday the capital city was a bustling carnival.  I especially miss the throngs of laughing children.<br/><br/><b>Why did I join the temple?</b><br/>It was on my seventh birthday that a Flying Pilgrim came down to our little world.  A girl had written about her mother, I think having to do with her being sick.  Her father was one of our few prisoners.  But, that is their story, not mine.  After this Pilgrim convinced my father to release the man, he gave me one last look -- one of sadness, I think -- and left.  After that, I think I began seeing the world differently, and I left home (with my father's blessing, of course) to understand why that Pilgrim looked at me like he did, and why it affected me so.<br/><br/><b>What test did I pass to enter the temple?</b><br/>I wept.  As many of us children were waiting outside the temple, well cared for, waiting for our test to enter the temple, tragedy struck.  A boy, maybe the same age as me, had a turtle with him.  That turtle died, but the boy refused to grieve, because he thought it not to be monkish to do so.  I grieved for the boy and for the turtle.  The next day, I was allowed to enter, and while they didn't tell me why, I knew it was because I wept for the boy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107434/#Comment_107434" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T13:59:48+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  1:59PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me just say that I'm really enthused by the characters so far.

One of us cried tears of fire and admitted that she had put a letter in her pocket, asking the Temple to save us, for she did not wish to be a queen of the netherworld.

Instead, we drifted over them into a courtyard where a monk was burning incense, drawing us into the sweet fumes.  He had put out a plate of steamed rice on a low wooden table and we ate hungrily in gratitude before collapsing to the ground in sleep.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107516/#Comment_107516" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-09T08:47:47+00:00" title="November  9, 2007  8:47AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.
