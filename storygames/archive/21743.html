<p>The idea of a human referee that could interpret and adjudicate unusual or unforseen situations in refereed wargames (as opposed to games like Advanced Squad Leader that has tons and tons of rules for everything so that less adjudication and subjectivity is needed) is what created roleplaying games in the first place.</p><p>So of course all <strong>problems</strong> can also be traced there.</p><p>This is like saying that breathing oxygen is the root of all disease.</p><p>That said, GM-less and GM-full games were an important further development of that concept and can address or sidestep a lot of (but not all) of the problems associated with GM:ed games.</p><p>However, some examples of problems with RPGs that do arise <small>(not necessarily exclusively)</small> in GM-less/full games include:</p><ul><li>Traumatic or triggering content</li><li>Gonzo or non-serious content</li><li>Lack of buy-in</li><li>Lack of engagement</li><li>Social pressure and problems</li><li>“Spotlight” tension</li><li>Rejection &amp; heartbreak over crushed creativity</li><li>Boring or overly exciting ideas</li><li>Racist, sexist or otherwise kyriarchal/patriarchal content</li><li>Rules mistakes and arguments</li><li>Scheduling conflicts</li><li>Out-of-game problems, abuse, or bad behavior, bullying</li><li>Debates &amp; flamewars online</li></ul><p>And more.</p>

                            Tangentially, when it comes to the words "GM-less" vs "GM-full" I personally think "GM-less" makes the most sense for most of the games — there's an absense of the traditional GM role, the <i>master</i>.<br/><br/>That said, I've vowed to never argue semantics so that's why I used both terms above. So that those who strongly prefer one or the other terms would be appeased and not try to start trouble♥<br/><br/>I'm not particularly invested in either word                        </div>

                            I subscribe to the idea that roleplaying games are shamanistic rituals. Everything wrong with RPGs can be traced to failure of this ritual and the skill with which the GM reads and leads the participants. Of course an untrained teen leading his peer will do a bad job most of the time.<br/><br/>"Story games" which are usually but not always GM-less take steps to move the activity away from shamanistic rite and into something else. I think this explains why some people don't feel like "story games" are "real" roleplaying games, more than challenge vs collaboration or adhering to traditional forms.<br/><br/>As with religion I think people experience ritual activity with different intensity, some are attracted to it and some repulsed. I think this is also why roleplaying games sometimes create moral panics, because religious people do recognize them as ritual activity even when the players themselves do not.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/stefoid">@stefoid</a>: What problems do you have specifically in mind?<br/><br/>My root problem with 99% of all roleplaying games are that they are badly designed with flawed focus.<br/><br/><i>Examples</i><br/>Badly designed: all combat systems.<br/>Flawed focus: XP as reward for anything else than mechanical achievements (like combat).<br/><br/>Badly designed with flawed focus: The Storytelling System that has a simulationistic rule system.<br/><br/>I blame the root of roleplaying games for that. Those first roleplaying games that set the mark, and provided the guidelines in how to think when either writing or designing a roleplaying game. This is, for example, why people scratched their heads, and had to refer to obscure blog or forum posts to play Forge games in the beginning, because people were stuck in how to play roleplaying games and, mostly, in how to write them.                        </div>

                            I'm with Rickard: the root of all evil is not the GM, it's bad design. Technically, it's bad design combined with the human flaw of desire. If people didn't demand so much of their games, those games would not fail them so badly.<br/><br/>I think it's understandable to blame the GM, as that design element is so prominent in D&amp;D, the original roleplaying game. However, one should not forget that D&amp;D is also a remarkably shitty design (with a powerful premise, I'll grant that). It set the bar quite low for everything that followed.<br/><br/>Although, yes: the combat system is awesome. No contradiction there.                        </div>

<i>The messy, murky overload of distinct game functions and social roles all onto a single person uninformatively called</i> "a GM" - overload which possibly started with the very shift from refereed wargames (probably the most efficient way to achieve a deep and detailed simulation) to various experimental uses of D&amp;D to achieve different ends - is the root of <i>several</i> things which are wrong with RPGs, both in terms of design and the social "scene" surrounding them. I do believe so.<br/>I'm afraid just doing away with "the GM" in a naive way can't magically fix any of those problems, though - we've had to start dissecting "the GM" into its tiniest constituent bits and we must keep doing so.                        </div>

                            I agree with the ritualistic aspect but I think that not all ritual have to be strictly lead and directed. I participated in psychodynamic sessions where we only had a faciliator and it was a blast. I tried it with my students who had zero experience with it and it worked the same way.<br/><br/>What I mean is that the role of the shaman is less hierarchical than the GM's. But I agree that traditionally both tend to have a mystery cult thing lingering around it.                        </div>

                            The root of all problems is cognitive biases. Each person has their particular experience, tastes and mental associations. So, when we design games we tend to consider only our experience as players and GMs; we know which things work for our group and know how to make them work, but rarely see how these things can be misused or broke by players and other GMs, often leaving too many holes in the rules.<br/><br/>When it comes to explaining our games we assume players know lots of things we consider common sense, and we end up neglecting important steps needed to play our games properly. <br/><br/>When it comes to reading other people's games we rely on our experience and rarely read all the explanations in detail, assuming we already know how most of the game is played and that the only things that change are character creation, the setting, which dice we roll, how many and maybe some other procedure here and there. Even worse, we relate specific procedures with previous bad experiences with a similar procedure and think the design is flawed before even trying to test it.<br/><br/>When it comes to GMing a lot more of disasters happen. When describing scenes we make even more assumptions and consider that if the player can't infere our line of thought it's their fault, so rocks fall and everyone dies. When adjudicating the rules we assume our judgement and knowledge of our group is always better than any assumptions the designer could have made about their game and how it should work. We could even end up assuming that something the players did was fully intentional and a personal attack against us or our work and end up reacting to it, even subconsiously.<br/><br/>As we play we end up assuming the GM has prepped in full detail so anything described hints more content. Even that peasant carelessly added in a scene because it made sense, the one which the GM obviously named on the spot, must have a really interesting secret, because it makes sense for us in narrative terms! And if he doesn't speak then we must kill him because he must be the final boss in disguise!<br/><br/>And so on and on, it's wonderful that admist all of this we get to make some games and groups click and work wonders, even if we often have to houserule or hack them into something the creator could never recognize.                        </div>

I think shamans can have a lot or a little authority but having one at all is the important dividing line between "role-playing games" and "story games". Either you're using augury to explore a fictional reality, taking on roles separate from your normal identity, or you're trying to tell the best story together with your friend. It's not about the strictness of the form either, compare the shaman-less Fiasco with the shaman-lead D&amp;D. In the first you have discrete scenes, endings, components and you're not allowed to or supposed to veer away from it. In D&amp;D leaving the beaten path happens all the time because even if it's not designed for it the players are allowed to stop adventuring and start running a monster zoo.                        </div>

                            I do think the provocative subject line is at least a plausible explanation for the historically high barrier to entry for grown-up play-pretend.  Supposing the first-ever RPG had been structured like Fiasco, how different would the cultural niche of RPGs be today?  They might be viewed more like writers' workshops or small group theater.<br/><br/>...actually, maybe I'm just fine with the way it is.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I very much agree with this. The concept of a GM is terribly unintuitive (I've seen so many new players have huge amounts of difficulty wrapping their heads around how it works and how to interact with it), it creates an easily exploitable hierarchy, the practices of it are littered with things that are terrible practice as far as the way to treat people, and the role is horribly contradictory to the point that even a lot of people who have been playing for years can't wrap their minds around how to do it. <br/><br/>There's also the fact that there's nothing a GM does that couldn't be handled by group collaboration, so a GM prevents that level of collaboration, and basically prevents players from having to put in work, which then sets up those players to not be able to play anything but GMed games, and which places waaaaaay to much work on the GM to this ridiculous disproportionate level. <br/><br/>Basically, GMing is filled with shitty social practices, way too confusing and contradictory of a thing, and it places too much strain on one participant.<br/>In my eyes, the hobby would be much better off if the GM role had never been created in the first place.                         </div>

                            I think most of Sandra's list can actually happen just fine (as in "pretty unpleasantly") in a game without a GM, and that a group that is capable of avoiding them without a GM is probably just as capable of avoiding them with a GM.<br/><br/>I don't think the concept of the GM is as uninituitive as it is painted either - many people these days have experience with computerized RPGs where you control "Your guy" and "the game" controls everything else.  That maps pretty easily onto GM'd games, where you control "your guy" and the GM controls everything else.  If people are legitimately approaching the hobby with no CRPG experience and are just looking for a "shared storytelling" format, then yes, it can be (but isn't necessarily) a bad fit.  I'm not really convinced that it "makes people incapable of playing anything but GM'd games" either -- though it certainly may create a predisposition towards doing so, moreso from the perspective of "I really like Italian food because it has tomato sauce!" "Thai food is really good too!" "Yes, but I want something with tomato sauce" perspective.  It's not that the people are incapable of finding themselves some Thai food, it's that they've found a specific thing that they like and they want more of that.<br/><br/>There are other questions of "is being a GM too damn much work" to which there are varying answers, and certainly, there are some problems here, but I feel like a large part of them circle around something closer to what Rickard was driving at -- that even games to which the GM is CRUCIAL and is functionally the "load bearing boss" of the game do a TERRIBLE DAMN JOB of teaching people how to actually do it.                        </div>

                            Mostly, I'm just annoyed that I don't get to play when I GM. And being a player in GMed games is no good either because most of the systems are run in this super boring, roleplaying 101 style - probably because of the teaching issues mentioned above and the way they're designed. There are some good ones, nonetheless. In general I stick to GMless rpgs. In any case, <i>wrong</i> seems unnecessarily moralizing.                        </div>

                            I think one of the most fundamental appeals of roleplaying is "imagine you're someone else, somewhere else".  Many players prefer to emphasize this aspect to the extent that it's incompatible with <i>also</i> deciding what the environment does.  This may be the biggest reason why RPGs are neither writer's workshops nor small group theater nor strategy games (at least not entirely).<br/><br/>"Never ask the GM, always ask the system," would be great if it were practical, but it isn't practical.  To cover every relevant word that comes out of a traditional GM's mouth, you'd need hundred-page modules, or thousand-page modules if it's not a straight railroad.<br/><br/>I mean, there probably are a lot of groups out there that would be happier playing GMless, but it's certainly not all.  I doubt it's even the majority.<br/><br/>That said, I think reducing the GM role to the point where it can be shared while minimally intruding on any given player's "just play my character" experience is a <i>very</i> worthy project.  Module flavor text, group situation prep, rules for NPC/monster behavior, branching decision trees -- I think our toolkit for this is still growing and developing.                        </div>

                            Exactly everything David_Berg just said! <b>The concept of a GM</b> arises as a response to questions like, "How do we adjudicate issues not covered by the rules?" and "How do we create meaningful experiences that rely on separation of the players from the things they're interacting with?" (and honestly, the first of those questions might very well be just a subset of the second).<br/><br/>I don't think you can throw away the concept of a GM without invalidating whole styles of play that the concept was created to support. You can try distributing the responsibility for answering those questions in different ways but (and this is, as I understand it, the origin of the phrase "GM-full") you can't actually eliminate the concept and keep the style of play the same. <br/><br/>Unless you want to suggest that meaningful separation of the players from what they interact with is what's wrong with RPGs (and I think that for a lot of people the main appeal of RPGs actually stems from that)... I think that the concept is so deeply embedded into a significant portion of RPG play that, like Sandra suggests, it borders on the tautological to lay blame on it.                        </div>

                            I think there's a level where I would say that that separation is a big part of the problem. There's no other creative medium I can think of where some of the co-creators are disallowed from creating and declaring information about, so it makes little sense (to me at least) why RPGs force that separation.                        </div>

                            I'm not so sure that it should be taken as a given that roleplaying games are a "creative medium," or at least that they are analogous to other media which earn that title. To resurrect another recent discussion, this is a good example of why I like referring to RPGs as "toys"; the toy designer may have free reign to create the toy however she wishes, but the people who play with it are then restricted by some aspect of the toy in how they play.<br/><br/>Play itself can still be creative, but when you pick a specific toy to play with aren't you essentially agreeing to be bound in some way by it? I don't think that's a "problem" in and of itself, though, unless you're being told by a bunch of people that you're actually supposed to be using the toy for something outside the scope of its reasonable functions. If someone hands you some legos and says to play catch, or gives you a bunch of rubber balls and tells you to build a house out of them. Wasn't that disconnect between form and stated function what basically set Ron Edwards off all those years ago? Being told that you can create stories with this book when the book didn't actually offer anything of the sort.                        </div>

                            Yeah, some RPGs are about story creation.<br/><br/>Others are about experiencing a world and instigating, causing, or managing trouble in that world.<br/><br/>When I was a child I loved a game where you hid an object — we used a big old housekey — and then the other searched for it, and you'd say "hot" if it's close and "cold" if it's far away, and "bird" if it's high, "fish" if it's low, and "inbetween" otherwise.<br/><br/>That was a game with very separate roles. (The game Zendo, which I talk about often, also has very different roles.)<br/><br/>Now, I'm with you in hating RPGs where the player role is passive and constrained — "paths". I favor sandbox play, not "find the key" or "find the hidden rule" play in RPGs.<br/><br/>But hidden information enables discovery.                        </div>

                            If a creative medium becomes a toy by having constraints, then I suppose music turns from a creative medium into a toy when you add a piano, which is clearly a constraint. Therefore piano music is better characterized as an activity of play than as art. Music is only a real creative medium when it's composed for and performed without constraints like tonality or physical instruments.<br/><br/>Storytelling similarly becomes a play practice by adding pen and paper, and the conventions of written word - not to speak of a specific language. Even more insidiously, poetry is playing with verbal toys: very constrained by similar rules of order and form as rpgs are. To be a true creative medium, poetry needs to have no toy-like rules created by an external authority and referenced by the poet.<br/><br/>Let's also think a bit about what Emma said: because no known creative medium requires the co-creators to limit and structure their inputs according to rules, we can say that the proper way to create e.g. a movie is to begin by having every member of the production staff write their own script drafts, which are then amalgamated together in a script meeting (which is, of course, not chairmanned by anybody). After all, doing otherwise would be something we've never heard of happening outside roleplaying games: distribution of tasks between co-creators in a creative medium.<br/><br/>Fun with reductio ad absurdum, the one argument of logic that probably has never convinced a single human being of anything despite being technically speaking valid logic. Probably something to do with our wiring.                        </div>

                            Obviously I am going to disagree largely with the premise here. I think anything like this has advantages and disadvantages. But the criticisms people who want GMless often make of games with a GM game, are frequently around the thing proponents of a solid referee see as important to enjoying play. I unfortunately don’t have time to get in depth here as I am on my way out the door. But I will say I don’t think the problem is the presence of a GM, the design of the majority of GM heavy games, etc. I think it comes down to things like expectations of play, the quality of the GMs and players, and the social atmosphere at the table. I can honestly say, I think games where the GM has the ability to properly adjudicate and act as a referee pulls me into the game more than anything else. For me it is the best way to play an RPG.                         </div>

                            I do think that Eero has a point though.  Emma, can you cite other creative media that allow for multiple contributors that DON'T restrict them to roles?   Because when I think about it:<br/><br/>Movie creation CLEARLY does this.  There are script writers, directors, etc. <br/>Video Game creation clearly does the same thing - artists, writers, etc.<br/>Writing a book, insofar as it involves more people than the author, also restricts the additional participants to roles like "editor"<br/>Musical composition, as far as I know, is pretty much entirely a solo activity, so isn't relevant here.<br/>Musicaly performance, on the other hand, definitely sorts people by role.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm misunderstanding where you are going with this, but I don't think this is as unique as you make it out to be.  Pretty much the only thing I can think of where "everyone is an equal participant" is improv comedy, which makes THAT the exception, rather than RPGs.                        </div>

                            The rpg tradition does have a lot to answer for when it comes to the player role's legitimacy, though - in that sense I couldn't agree more with the idea that there's something wrong. Not with the GM per se, but the other players!<br/><br/>The big, fat question that every game should be answerable for is this: does the game actually establish player roles that are worthwhile to perform in the act of play, and does it support those roles?<br/><br/>That question might seem simplistic, but it is actually something that I have been wrestling with for years, far beyond the simple concern of what the pages of a given game book might claim. How does the individual player understand the purpose of the game? How do they understand their own role in playing it? Does the game as it is played actually enable the player to perform that role?<br/><br/>This is something that constantly causes minor and major issues with roleplaying games, the nature of the player role. For a simple example, consider our recently started 4th edition D&amp;D railroad princess play epic fantasy campaign: I am crystal clear on what the player roles are, and have done my utmost to ease the players into those roles. Despite this, only two players out of five are fully acclimated. The rest essentially participate only partially because the game's activity interface is still unfamiliar to them, and because their skills are incomplete and they are thus unable to perform every aspect of the player's role that this kind of game has to offer.<br/><br/>The first and foremost question that absolutely must be addressed every time we have players participating incompletely (and I'd argue that this is almost every session of play ever) is whether the player role the game offers them is even meaningful, or if it is actually a sham. This is what I mean by role legitimacy: would the GM be happy to participate in the game as one of the character players himself? Does the game's process provide the players with satisfying and meaningful responsibilities? Or is the very idea that "it is fun to be a player in a roleplaying game" something that is only conditionally true, and might not apply to you or me or him or her? Can you be confident that the role you are offering the other player in your game is a meaningful one?<br/><br/>If I had to point at a single flaw in the role-assignments of a traditional rpg, it wouldn't necessarily be the GM's role. Sure, it's frustratingly vague and laden with responsibilities. However, the player's role is much worse: the tradition offers the player no responsibility whatsoever, and no rights. If I had to fix just one of these it would be the player side of the equation, because I know full well that the traditional all-powerful GM can work well, which is not something that I can say about the traditional player role. I have only ever had fun as a character player when I have played a game where either the game hands me a real creative role, or I invent one for myself. When neither of those happens I might as well be a footstool for all the significance I have for the game's process.                        </div>

I agree with this... but what´s the point? In improv comedy you too engage in different roles.<br/><br/>The key question is: Do you need a leader, conductor, organisator, games master, presenter or something like that? Or is every player on a par with the others? You can do different things, but they are of equal importance. In Jazz, in improv theatre and in some roleplaying games.<br/><br/> </div>

Agreed, but players certainly do imagine what the environment does in response to their intentions.

Even jazz bands (tend to) have bandleaders, though, and they often have responsibilities that go beyond those of the other members, including outlining performances, setting pacing, signaling transitions, and generally they need to have more generalized knowledge of what the other participants can and should be doing in order to make the performance work.

It is also worth pointing out, RPGs are not jazz and they are not movies, they are their own thing. Can you make more clearly defined roles? Yes. For some games that may be a good fit. But roles can also be constricting. And I think one of the strengths of an RPG is allowing you to engage the setting freely. I am not saying it is the only way to do things. But I do think the basic set up going back to things like D&amp;D of a GM running the game, and players playing their characters, is a tried and true method that just works. My first experience with RPGs was very striking for this reason, and it has continued to be the thing that draws me to RPGs.                        </div>

                            I beg for well-intentioned reading. Of course there are bandleaders in Jazz. And if you take a standard BigBand my example is rather bad.<br/><br/>But if you´re listening to smaller Jazz ensembles in Bebop style or later, you can often detect the idea of balancing the roles of the individual musicians. Everybody has to contribute a part of equal importance. If someone would be absent, the whole issue suffers.<br/><br/>By the way: to my mind, traditional gamemasters do more than only set up the players to play... but maybe this could be up to different experiences by you and me.                        </div>

I am <i>trying</i> not to reply to everything!  <br/><br/>I think a "distributed GM role" is a different concept from  THE GM.  "the Game Master".

Everyone's already made that point but I'm not happy about sarcasm (which Eero already apologized for) and dogpiling. I even disagree with Emma here and did so right away, but, seeing the chorus makes me feel bad about that<br/><br/>And obviously: writing together.

                            Collaborative writing is the big example, like Sandra pointed out.<br/>Freeform roleplaying. Co-writing novels and short stories. Workshopping your writing as a group. Songwriting sessions with your band. Improv theatre. etc, etc, etc.<br/>I know there's more examples I'm not thinking of, but it's late and I'm a bit emotionally exhausted at this time of night. <br/>And yes, I know that those things are often only a few collaborators, but that's why I'm personally a big believer in really small groups. 3 players is the size of the group I play in, and 4 players is the largest group I would play with (and playing with four would require one of those players doing something other than playing a PC, for instance something world-playing but not GM-ly like the HG role in Chuubo's, for instance). My ideal size for a campaign (and the paradigm I'm most used to in my play practice) is 2 PCs in a campaign, thus a really small number of collaborators. Not so many that you'd be surprised to see a novel or screenplay that that number of people had co-written, since like, media written by 2-3 people together as collaborators is pretty common.                        </div>

                            Mind to drop the music analogy for a bit? I think it's actually obscuring the discussion. Try this instead:<br/><br/>This is my personal experience: When we write comics at our workshop there's a moment where roles are undefined and each step of the story is a discovery. Whatever we don't know yet about the story is a challenge -Even if we start from the end and go to the beginning. We start talking about a story and everyone contributes in a way that feels natural for a conversation.<br/><br/>That is, somebody leads until that person doubts and either someone in the group reads it and gives their input or the first person asks the group for it. The new input should follow /it's judged based on a couple axioms: Is it cool? Does it make sense in the shared space?<br/><br/>That's my experience on collaborative writing. Let's borrow that and put it into the RPG definition for a moment.<br/><br/>Add the toy. The toy brings boundaries that help us focus, like roles, like specific procedures to do things, like simulationism. Now we have to think a bit more about how things get done, which adds depth and credibility to the story.<br/><br/>Add other media as in reference, inspiration material, prep, background music, the group's background (shared culture, inside jokes, etc)<br/><br/>Basically you could say that that's the game. A conversation, an exchange of ideas, information and emotions, limited by a bunch of tools.<br/><br/>Focus or complicate any part, like the GM role, the player role, the toy, the modules, the prep, the rules. You get a good game as long as everyone playing can handle it. That's why sometimes GMed games work, or why we ditch the encumbrance rules, or prefer using a grid instead of theather of the mind. Limits in RPGs are good as long as they help us to make a better experience, keep us from falling into arguments or derrailing the fun, -even if that means derrailing the plot.<br/><br/>Simplify any part, you can't get less than a exchange of information (I mean, technically there's no conversation in a solo game) a bunch of tools and somebody making decisions based on what's more cool and makes sense.<br/><br/>If any part of this system feels lacking, the natural player response would be to patch it: Ignore/disregard/alter rules, ignore GM cues, focus on something else, find your own fun, reduce the GM's role, use illusionism, hack and redo the toy, etc etc.<br/><br/>Perhaps a more balanced game is the answer some people are looking for. Personally I like this idea, but I realize that what I consider balanced isn't everyone's cup of tea.<br/><br/>Again, I'd say the problem it's not the concept of the GM, but how each person's mind understands it, the bad experiences we relate to it but that not everyone else shares, and how we let our good experiences blind us from realizing how bad things can go                        </div>

                            I have some experience with the fandom/fiction freeform space myself, and my experience is that oftentimes, someone is, as the trite saying goes "more equal than others." It might or might not be 'official' but it's often true.  Regardless though, I think the statement "RPGs are the only medium in which this happens" has been proven incorrect at this point.  They're not unique that way.  There are other media that do it, and there are other media that don't.   As a result, we might want to consider dispensing with comparisons to other media entirely.<br/><br/>I think Eero's assertion that there is something wrong with the "player" role is interesting, but I feel like there are problems with how he's looking for the problems.  The metric of "would the GM be happy to participate in the game as one of the character players himself?" is a problematic one in my mind.  I've never, ever heard of a situation where an RPG group/community (community in the sense of "a bunch of people who player together and may be too numerous to form a single 'group' in the way that term is often used) where the problem was "We have too many people who want to GM and not enough who are willing to play."  This is just not a thing that happens, in my experience, which leads me to believe that questioning whether the GM would be willing to play is either trivial ("The GM is basically always willing to play") or irrelevant ("It doesn't really matter, because there are far more people who are willing to play than who aren't.")<br/><br/>I also struggle with the next question: "Does the game's process provide the players with satisfying and meaningful responsibilities?"  -- I have a strong suspicion that for most people engaging in RPGs, the lack of "responsibilities" is a feature, not a bug.  This is why it's often so damn hard to get people who aren't the GM to engage with the game outside of a session.  Many times, I hear players railing against too much "responsibility" for stuff even during the session.<br/><br/>I also feel like "Or is the very idea that "it is fun to be a player in a roleplaying game" something that is only conditionally true?" is a flawed question - I have many activities that I enjoy, but the number of them that are always fun and cannot be screwed up in some way by other people (or even myself) is a much, much smaller number.  Indeed, it might be restricted to "reading a good book."   So I think this needs to be refined in some way, but I'm not super sure what the 'right' question is.<br/><br/>I don't think it's really a problem for most people that the player role has no responsibilities;  Maybe there's an issue that it has no rights, but those two things are tied together, and I suspect that for every person who'd be pleased to have more rights at the table, there's a person who'd be annoyed by the added responsibilities.                        </div>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The metric of "would the GM be happy to participate in the game as one of the character players himself?" is a problematic one in my mind.  I've never, ever heard of a situation where an RPG group/community (community in the sense of "a bunch of people who player together and may be too numerous to form a single 'group' in the way that term is often used) where the problem was "We have too many people who want to GM and not enough who are willing to play."  This is just not a thing that happens, in my experience</p></div></blockquote>
I feel like what Eero was getting at was not a general "desire to be a player," but for GMs to look critically at instances of games they've run and think, "How much would I actually enjoy being on the other side of what I'm doing (and what would I have to do to enjoy it)?" Presuming of course that they can climb down off their high and mighty GM thrones long enough to assume the mindset of a player, that is ;P<br/><br/>The problem, at least as I read him to be saying, is not a question of <i>whether</i> player rights and responsibilities (and how much of either is desired), but the extent to which those are ever actually made clear, and how that lack of clarity affects games.<br/><br/>Historically, for all the opinions and advice columns and books that have been written on GMing, there's been comparatively less written about how to be a player. I feel like the "storygaming movement" did a lot to upend this trend, at least for the games those people were interested in, but I think that there's still a lot left unsaid particularly for more trad-leaning playstyles.                        </div>

How do you know that?  <br/></div></blockquote>I think that's the key question here.  If it <i>were</i> practical to replace the GM with a set of rules and resources, then we could imagine participating in traditional-style roleplay without risking the downsides of bad GMs!<br/><br/>But think about all the things a traditional GM needs to contribute to enable that experience.  They need to describe what the characters see and hear and smell.  They need to play NPCs.  They need to offer useful responses when the players are probing what their options are.  They need to know which pre-made content to refer to when the players take certain actions or go to certain locations.  They may need to ad-lib new content when the players do something unanticipated.  Whatever the players do, and whatever the results, the GM needs to make it come to life with something more than the bare minimum factual description.<br/><br/>Good luck fitting all that between two covers.  And if you did do it, good luck to the poor play group trying to actually use it without breaking their flow.  I cannot imagine this is remotely possible.  <br/><br/>If you start replacing books with apps, then maybe, but you'd need enormous sales to make up for the gigantic overhead.                        </div>

Yes; And I am prepared to say "I guess that does happen" just as soon as someone tells me that it does.  I've been following an awful lot of RPG discussions and help spaces for an awful long time, and I see lots of "no one wants to GM" and I've never seen "I can't find any players" except in the context of "I can't find anyone who wants to engage with an RPG at all".  So yes, the plural of anecdote is not data, and it's theoretically possible that this happens all the time somewhere I'm not, but at this point it seems unlikely.<br/><br/>I think yukamichi's idea of "Would a GM enjoy his particular game as a player" is more likely, but I'm not sure that's a good metric either.  Because I suspect that most GMs will fall into either the "I am running the game I wish I was playing" camp (whether they are doing that WELL or not is another question -- one that probably hearkens back to the earlier mention of bad procedures and teaching) or the "I'm GMing BECAUSE I'm not interested in playing!" camp.                        </div>

The good collaborative storytelling games I played did all that without it feeling forced, so I'm curious what you got in mind when you write "breaking the flow". What kind of flow are we talking about?<br/> </div>

I don't understand that at all.<br/><br/>"A group will only handle it if they like the game. If they don't like the game, then they should look through a huge book instead".<br/><br/>It doesn't sound feasible. <br/><br/>Can you use another analogy, where you use board games instead?<br/><br/>When can we cut the game master from boardgames?                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> <br/><br/>When we state our characters intentions, we imagine the desired outcome.  So in terms of that atomic building block of RPGs, we dont strictly need a GM for that, players can state both intentions and desired outcomes themselves.<br/><br/>But thats unsatisfying.   Achieving the desired outcome is only satisfying if the stated intentions are in response to a problem that isnt of my own devising.<br/><br/>And, achieving the desired outcome, even to a problem I havent devised myself, is only satisfying if there is also the possibility of <b>not</b> achieving the desired outcome. <br/>OR... if you are guaranteed of desired outcomes at the atomic level, then there needs to be the possibility that the sum of your desired outcomes does not achieve your goal.  like Chess.<br/><br/> but... we need problems to solve that are not of our own devising and we need some <i>uncertainty</i> somewhere.<br/><br/>agree/disagree?<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            I find the idea that achieving the desired intention is only satisfying if it's in response to a problem that isn't of your own creation to be really interesting, because I feel completely the opposite, actually. <br/><br/>I personally find that the most interesting problems for me, the ones I most enjoy exploring, are the ones I devise for myself, because then I'm getting to explore exactly the sort of problems I'm interested in exploring, on exactly the terms I want to. I'm getting to tell that story my way instead of someone else's way.<br/><br/>I also find it wholesale unengaging when there's a chance that the sum of the desired outcomes doesn't achieve my goal, because if I might not even get to achieve my narrative goals, if I might not even get to tell my character's story <i>correctly</i>, for me there's no point at all in playing. <br/><br/>For me, there's no point in putting in the effort to make collaborative art if there's an uncontrollable risk that I might not even achieve my goals as an artist in the creation of that art. If I don't achieve my artistic goals in play, then for me, there was no point in playing. I could have just done something non-artistic with my friends, and I would have had a better time doing it, because then I wouldn't be frustrated about wasting my time doing something artistic where I'm not achieving my artistic goals.<br/><br/>tldr, problems not of our own devising and uncertainty are the absolute last thing I want, but as has been stated and restated again and again and again, my opinions are far from universal. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Agreed. Our experiences are different everyone! It doesn't matter how sure you are that your experience is more common, how many people you know in person or online that had the same experience as you. There's still the cursed cognitive bias, plato's cave that doesn't allow each of us to see the whole picture. Nobody here is wrong nor telling lies (I can tell by how passionate each of us is when defending their point of view)<br/><br/>So best I think we can do is reduce the RPG to basic components in a way that validates as much of each individual experiences as possible. Hence my previous post, that can be resumed to:
<blockquote> the RPG experience is basically made of:<br/><b>-A conversation / exchange of information</b>. It's subject to usual problems in any conversation, but relies on ritual phrases that trigger procedures to hop over some of those problems.<br/><b>-A list of rules, mechanics, procedures</b> that limit the scope of the game, help players simulate anything (reality, a particular genre of fiction, an atmosphere, etc), meant to inspire them further. At least rules work best when they do this, but may not be the case for some rules designed with a different agenda than the group has.<br/><b>-Reference data</b>, either as prep, predesigned content, knowledge on tastes developed by the group, additional media, illustrations in the core book, etc.<br/><br/>The conversation may use more or less ritual phrases, may have someone leading it or not, that person may be trying to direct the group, react to their input, use prep, improvise, oracle the dice, use random tables, etc. It's often a dynamic process switching between all these states and more. Everything is valid as long as the group agrees to it and has fun with it.<br/><br/>The list of rules may have been designed with a specific agenda in mind, may be the same as the group of players or a different one, in which case some of it will be ignored, changed, houseruled, etc. Often designers will have their own cognitive bias and forget to explain crucial things they believe to be "common sense" among players. Other times it's the player's previous experiences the ones that influence them on how they read the game. They will skip those parts they believe they already know how to do and focus on their agenda. If it's the same of the designer's the game will probably click with the group as it is.<br/><br/>The reference data might be fresh enough in the player's minds that they won't need prep, or the GM may have enough tables and tricks to oracle game content in the spot. The players may prefer the opposite, to stick to a predesigned module. Game challenges may be created by the players openly or by the GM in secret.<br/><br/>Basically the group will dictate which combination, proportion and complexity of each of these elements is both cool and makes sense. Those are the only true laws behind it all. <br/><br/>There are patches when any of the elements fail, some may be so nicely handled by the group that they become a functional part of the game instead of a patch though. That doesn't make them a basic element of the RPG experience, as other groups experience with the same patch will be totally different.<br/></blockquote>
That's it. Would anyone say that any of this goes against their personal experience?                        </div>

                            My group is very very big on determining the narrative intent of a scene and general content of a scene before beginning the scene. <br/>So like for instance an example of the sort of thing I'm talking about:<br/><br/>"So in this scene, Sora is going to get into a fight with her rival Ayako, and she's going to lose that fight, but they're both going to give it everything they've got."<br/>(Sora's player would frame that, and Ayako is an NPC in that situation)<br/><br/>"In this scene, Sadie enters the world of Sora's heart with Mizune, and drives the corruption out of Sora's heart, but while they're in the heart, the corruption hurts Mizune to the point that afterwards Sadie has to use heart magic to save Mizune from dying, which is going to lead into some stuff later where Mizune is afraid to enter Sora's heart again, and Sadie comforts her and promises to protect her."<br/>(Sadie is my PC in the campaign in question, and Mizune is an NPC)<br/><br/>Or like, something that happens regularly in that campaign is that during a fight scene for instance, there are times where Sora's player is like "I want Sora to get hurt here, and I want her to be outmatched, but then she draws on her powers to win the fight" in the middle of the scene, after having not totally laid that out from the get-go, but she decided in the moment it would be good.<br/>Or like there was a point where she wanted a fight to feel more largescale than it had been before, so she narrated in several more people from the gang she was fighting showing up and attacking her. <br/><br/>And that's the sort of stuff I'm talking about. Making your own situations, so that it's definitely stuff that suits your image of your character, and that suits the story you're telling about them.                        </div>

                            Chuubo's (and derived games) are unusual in this regard, even Microscope, as pure a story game as it is, has the desired outcomes of scenes obscured so players can be surprised or plans change. It's question based -- you'd set up a scene with "What does the victory over Sora cost Ayako?" or similar.<br/><br/>Your technique does come across as a bit redundant; to state the scene intent fully and then also play it out. But that's a personal hangup of mine, I also have a hard time with "free and clear"-phases in fighting games like Sorcerer and The One Ring (or the weapon speed factors in some editions of D&amp;D). I'm pretty enamored with to say it say it.                        </div>

                            Yeah, Chuubo's is definitely radically different from every other rpg pretty much in that regard. It's super super different on a deep paradigmatic level. The big thing is that Chuubo's doesn't care about consequences. It doesn't mechanize resolution of actions at all, because the resolution and the consequences aren't relevant. It's all about what the things you're doing mean to the characters who are doing them.<br/><br/>For me, stating the intent fully is a part of the outlining and planning process (just a part that's done in the moment), and then playing out the scene is actually writing the scene - making it a canon part of the story you're all writing together instead of just discussing it as a concept. Basically, the scene in discussion of intent is a vague unformed thing that we're planning out what we're going to write, then playing out the scene is the actual writing. <br/>Kind of like the difference between a synopsis of a chapter of a manga and the actual chapter. <br/><br/>I should also note that a big part of play for me and my group is focus on the craftsmanship of scenes. The "what" is established so that we can all be on the same page about where to begin with the "how", then the "how" is the experience that matters, because the "how" is what play is about for us.<br/>(The "what" just needs to be well-crafted as a story or our suspension of disbelief of the story as a story falls apart, and it starts to feel like bad fiction, that none of us would be comfortable putting our name on.)                        </div>

                            Right, in manga there's usually a lot of change between the storyboard step and the final comic. (I just the other day caught up with the tankobon releases of kimitodo, only one book left now.)<br/><br/>I just can't really stand in fighty rpgs where there's a whole "ok, I'm gonna shoot" and "I'm gonna run" and "I'm gonna get some fireballs online" and "I'm hanging back, nocking an arrow" and discussing it, sorting out the timing, chilling, THEN saying all of that stuff AGAIN. Like it's a fight you have one second what do you do? Grumble grumble Sorcerer free-and-clear grumble grumbre<br/><br/><br/>Anyway I hadn't until today realized how Chuubo &amp; Microscope are in the same genre of game more than any other game. Would be interesting to hear your take on Microscope, Emma, esp after some play experience with it. The differences such as no strong ownership over PCs and that you have to withold informanion, I'd love to hear what your experience with those restrictions would be, when placed in the context of Microscope                        </div>

Yes, and so do some team sports (football), but only in competitive play. And Go and Magic are two drops in a sea of games without judges (ex. bowling).<br/><br/>One huge beef I have with roleplaying game design is that you should be able to play anything within the premise of the world. Then you need a person that boils it down to what a specific group should play – you need a game master to tie all the loose ends together. It's weird how traditional roleplaying games are written as a game engine with the notion that the game master should pick the most suited parts and turn all that into a game (setting up world, plot and coordinating the characters into an adventure). <br/><br/>You shouldn't need that as a game designer but, if I address the thought the OP had, including the game master as a patchwork for your game is, to me, bad game design because the game is then not complete (hence, any toy analogy). Also, trying to include "play anything" is a flawed focus because it's too wide, and demands a game master to fix it.                        </div>

I've seen the thought expressed before that a game master <b>is</b> a game designer, that each scenario, each session, is essentially its own game. That the things we label "roleplaying games" are collections of inspirational procedures and guidelines for creating a panoply of unique, individual games, rather than being the games themselves.<br/><br/>I like this, to me it hearkens back to the idea of the bespoke wargame, where you didn't go out and buy "The Battle of Gettysburg," you designed the table yourself, arraigned the forces yourself, came up with the rules for representing the important parts of the battle yourself, in order to represent your own idea of Gettysburg.<br/><br/>I don't think that's "weird," per se, but I do think it's odd that most common taxonomical distinctions have conflated the rules and the game as a whole. Imagine trying to claim for any other game that the rule book alone was the whole kit and caboodle?                        </div>

... and I came to this realization as well, and if the game is created in that way then it's not really bad game design to me. It's like I'm saying a model of a plane is bad game design because you have to put it together before you can fly with it. To me, flying is the important part but perhaps it's the whole experience.<br/><br/>I cannot deny anyone that kind of whole experience, but cutting the game master would also (perhaps) be a shortcut into create a better focus for the game.

What else should be added, apart from the rule book and stuff that are needed to play the game?                        </div>

The module!<br/><br/>To me the core books of 5e (PHB/MM/DMG) would be a confusing mess if they were the game. If the Starter Set otoh was the game, then the core books make total sense as expansions.

Honestly, though, I think that's a pretty small subset of reasons why a GM is useful.<br/><br/>You can roll off a random chart to see what sort of problem comes your way.  You can roll dice based on your character attributes to introduce uncertainty into your character's attempt to overcome that problem.  You can consult a rule or a table to see what the result of your effort is.  You don't strictly need a GM for any of that, even in otherwise-traditional play where the players just play their characters.<br/><br/>I do think you need a GM to help make that a fun experience, though.  For example, a problem involving NPCs is hard to care about if no one portrays the NPCs.

                            All right! Let me go back to the proposed model for a moment. As a recipe for the RPG experience we've got:<br/><br/>-A conversation<br/>-Rules/procedures<br/>-Reference Data<br/><br/><b>Notice how the GM is missing.</b> It's not necessary. However, nature follows the path of least resistance, and what's easier than having everyone lead and be sensitive and thoughtful enough to keep the conversation focused? Well, having a single person lead and moderate the conversation, familiarize with the rules, research and create the data and manage it. What is more confortable than taking up responsabilities and prepare for a game? Delegating that responsability and showing up late. <br/><br/>And so on. Especially if it's both part of the designer's, the GM's and the group's agenda. Because they don't know any better. Because all these chores seem complicated and there's another person more passionate about creating and managing the world -either if that person is the GM or the module designer.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But Story Games came to prove all this wrong</span>, to facilitate and simplify those responsabilities, to distribute them among the players. Ritual phrases have evolved for this, as Archipielago and Witch Mountain proved to me. Then I saw character and story adjudication became free for all in Microscope. Most probably all these evolutions started somewhere else but it was on these games that I found out about them. And there's a lot more of course, piles and piles of tools and different point of views. Even trad games are starting to use them now.<br/><br/>We just have to remember there's at least a couple of <i>cognitive biases</i> separating the designer and the players: <br/><br/>-How good the designer is at explaining the game procedures and stating their agenda <br/><br/>-Player's (as in "players and GMs") previous experiences blinding them to the game experience proposed by the designer. <br/><br/>You either adress that in the design or embrace it as a designer/player. Both approaches are good as long as you don't ignore the cognitive biases, or you will be as guilty as anyone pretending their unique experience is everyone else's experience, or should be <i>if they weren't playing the game wrong</i> There's no such thing as long as the group is having fun. <br/><br/>People are only playing the game wrong if the conversation becomes an argument, if the rules misuse or poor design/explanation block the players, if they don't agree on the reference material or find it distasteful and managed poorly or in dishonest ways. Basically, if they don't find a part of the experience cool nor coherent to the point it can't be tolerated.                        </div>

I think if you want to design games without GMs, with limited GM power, that is fine. But this list leaves out crucial elements of roleplaying games like "roleplaying" and "exploration" just to point out 2. I understand you might be able to file Roleplay under conversation but that obscures much of how roleplaying is done. My view is this kind of conversation is going off the rails in the same way that many stylistic discussions go off the rails. If you view the hobby as a zero sum game, where one approach has to dominate or push out other approaches, we get discussions like this (and they occur from the opposite perspective on other forums as well, so I am not saying they are unique to story-games.com). But this notion that the GM is pointless, or doesn't serve a real function, or can easily be replaced by procedures is, I think, highly misguided. Again, the biggest thing that struck me about playing RPGs the first time I sat down to do so, was I was a robot on another planet, that felt real, and I could try anything. Unlike a computer game, I wasn't limited by what was programmed into it. The GM could adapt to what we tried by either using existing rules that cover those things, finding a new application for an existing rule, coming up with something on the spot, or simply deciding that what we were trying to do would result in X result. It isn't about people being led and following the path of least resistance. It is about having a human adjudicate because it takes a human to do so if you want that maximum sense of realness. A human being can be reactive to the players, sensing how much they are buying in, or when things are starting to slip. A procedure and a rule cannot do that.                        </div>

I would argue that replacing the game master with a process containing structures of play demands even <i>less</i> text than traditional roleplaying games, and I do that claim based on my analyses of different adventure writing models in roleplaying games. Every time it was a game with collaborative storytelling, the model was much simpler, because it focused on creating a process instead of a sequential procedure.<br/><br/>Bare in mind too, that traditional games usually add a rule mechanic and a setting above their adventure models, where collaborative storytelling games are both the game and the process you follow when playing the game.<br/><br/>I can't say more about this than having something more concrete to talk about. "GM's contributions" doesn't say much, to be honest.                        </div>

                            Here's a thought experiment: imagine if the default orientation of the GM throughout RPG history was to be <i>on the characters' side</i>.  What problems would that produce?  What problems would that avoid?<br/><br/>Perhaps the specific downsides that have come with GMed play over time are not at all about having a player who controls the imagined world, but rather about that player's relationship to the activity and the other players?<br/><br/>I was introduced to GMing by people who used it to power-trip and inflict their will on the players.

I'd take offense at this if it wasnt all my fault for explaining myself badly. I also admit this may look like derrailing the thread but I happen to be a fan of thinking out of the box to bypass hurdles. Hence this sidestepping, otherwise all we could do here would be quote our personal experiences until the majority of people with a similar experience gets their point across and the rest gets ignored as the exception. Nobody learns anything like that.<br/><br/>Back to my point, allow me to expand it a bit:<br/><br/>-A conversation: Any conversation starts when one person says something that requires a response or reaction from someone else. The person starting the conversation in any RPG is crucial. That person has to be informed of the game rules and procedures and a majority od the Reference data. So that person is crucial for the whole experience to happen. Call that person facilitator, or give that person more power/responsabilities and call her GM. But several games have already proven us that the responsabilities can be delegated on other players. Or with some limitations, to a computer program.<br/><br/>Crap, gtg, but I'll try to write back a few more things later.                        </div>

I'm not for planning the blow-by-blow of combat either, but I'm all about planning the meaning, and anything needed to make sure that in the scene that meaning shines through. <br/>Sometimes that's as basic as "Sora and Ayako fight". <br/>Sometimes that's "Sora and Ayako fight and Sora wins, but it's a really close fight". <br/>And sometimes that's "Sora and Ayako fight and during the fight there's a point where Sora has the upper hand, but then Ayako unleashes her new powers and takes the upper hand, but Sora tricks her into running into a barrier that saps her power, and she's forced to fight on even footing, and then Sora takes her by surprise since she wasn't expecting to lose her new powers, so then Sora takes the upper hand and wins by throwing Ayako through the bridge and into the water". <br/>It all depends on what meaning the scene is conveying, what the narrative purpose is, and how precise of images and moments need to exist in the scene to convey the meaning properly.<br/><br/>Or to further explain in the context of a different type of scene (this time not a fight scene, although this theoretically could be a fight scene):<br/>Sometimes a scene where my character talks to her boyfriend exists because we haven't had a scene with the two of them interacting in a while and we need to show that stuff is still going well with them so that it doesn't feel like that relationship is falling to the wayside.<br/>Sometimes a scene where my character talks to her boyfriend exists because we need to show that he is her foil, because he can still find beauty in the world despite his trauma, whereas my character has lost all hope in the beauty of the world in the wake of her trauma, and that in her story he represents a nearly-metaphysical stabilizing force, a being of light who mirrors and completes the shadows of her depression that hang around her, who can support her through the worst shadows of her life because he has had his own katabasis and found a way to come out the other side without losing sight of who he is, which is something she desparately needs to find to be whole again, and that way he is the metaphorical key to her finding a way to make peace with her life.<br/>That second type of scene takes much more set-up than the first one, planning symbolism to include, and perhaps even discussing specific lines of dialogue that need to be incorporated for the scene to fulfill its purpose. <br/>The first type of scene is the equivalent of the "Sora and Ayako fight, in terms of the amount of needed discussion.<br/>And the second is, of course the "Sora and Ayako fight and during the fight there's a point where Sora has the upper hand, but then Ayako unleashes her new powers and takes the upper hand, but Sora tricks her into running into a barrier that saps her power, and she's forced to fight on even footing, and then Sora takes her by surprise since she wasn't expecting to lose her new powers, so then Sora takes the upper hand and wins by throwing Ayako through the bridge and into the water".<br/><br/>On the thing about Microscope, I've read Microscope but haven't played it. <br/>I'm not especially keen to try it, because hidden information is something that freaks me out and makes me feel extremely unsafe, and lack of PC ownership goes against one of my core goals for roleplaying, which is deep exploration of characters, creating deeply character-focused works in play.<br/>But if I ever do try, I'll let you know for sure what my experience was like! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

My apologies for misattributing the quote (was unintentional, not sure how it occurred). <br/><br/>No one is denying you can play without a GM if you want to (or that you could use a computer program). But a computer program is insufficient for what a lot of people want out of an RPG. An RPG isn't just about the rules, the design intent, etc. Especially if you are playing in a traditional style where there is a strong expectation of the world being brought to life. Obviously you can delegate GM responsibilities to multiple people. But I think that does also produce a very different experience from a single GM. I've been in games with 2 GMs (I knew a couple of groups who did that back in the 90s) and even that is a very different experience. But a game where the GMs powers are distributed is going to result in something very different from a traditional campaign. Not saying its bad. But it is different because a key thing that makes the traditional style function is allowing a single person to have those powers. <br/><br/>Again, I am not saying you can't do other things. It is just going to be different, and there is a reason why some games will always have 1 GM acting in the traditional role.                         </div>

You got to keep in mind, not everyone is thinking in terms of producing good fiction (or in terms of scenes). The party offers a handy conceit for keeping the group focused on the same task. Whether that leads to challenge-based scenarios is largely a matter of things like system, preference and play style. If you were playing D&amp;D during the height of 3E, then challenge-based scenarios were the norm (and they became more codified in 4E). But in 2E and 1E, I think things are much more flexible in that respect. And if you go beyond D&amp;D to other games, it is even more so. <br/><br/>But I have run long term campaigns where players were in different places and/or were trying to achieve other goals. The biggest issue that presents is split screen time and also possibly more prep. I find even in groups where the party is quite cohesive, they often are not always in the same places. I've been in countless campaigns for instance that played out like a show like Stranger Things for Instance. <br/><br/>Which raises the point: the idea of a group that sticks together, isn't exactly unusual though even in fiction, television series and movies. Lots of stories feature teams or groups of characters. Heck even a sitcom has an ensemble cast that is basically a party.                         </div>

                            That's definitely true that it's not horribly uncommon fictionally. I think I was thinking it was because there's not any media I like that does that kind of ensemble cast, because I like media that's extremely character-focused, and specifically is extremely focused on the arcs of just a few characters (1-3, ideally for me).<br/>So that might very well have been a confirmation bias for me that made me say that 4-6 protagonists is rare. (It's also largely the fact that I find sitcoms and most team-based stories to not generally be very well-written, and when I took about something not being common in fiction, what I realistically am more getting at is "not very common in good fiction".)                        </div>

                            And that's okay Brendan. As in <i>we all respect GMed games</i>. The reason people defend GMless/GMfull games here is not to try to convince you to play them nor really attack trad games in that sense, they just want their personal experience recognized and validated. It's not "your experience sucks, here's our new one" but "we respect your experience but we want our experience to be respected too". You know, same as with all themes regarding any sort of believe in today's world.<br/><br/>I'm not listing specifically all trad elements in my recipe of the RPG experience because it's meant to be all inclusive, but as you realized, those elements can be added on the spots listed. The GM is the mediator of the conversation, the facilitator of the rules and procedures, the one who compiles, creates and edits the reference material. The experience with ahd without the GM is different, but as many people can testify, it's possible and fun. How fun it's a matter of tastes, so again, nobody is saying that you will like it or should even try it. We're just saying it's doable.<br/><br/>EDIT: Personally, I prefer a somewhat GMed game actually. One where players have their main characters but can pick up and play any NPC present on the scene whenever their main PCs aren't there. I've used cards to give players control over minor aspects of the scene, and when it happens it's wonderful how they start buiding over the challenge and complicate it. <br/><br/>I've got a<a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"> procedure</a> to brainstorm the setting along with the players. I've put up some other tricks to improvise different things on the spot and I'm working to make them better. I keep using the witch mountain trick and ask my players what they think something is. I steal idedas from them and implement them back into the game if theirs are better than mine. It's all in the open and players collaborate with this. <br/><br/>I once hacked microscope to play a flashback scene explaining a catastrophe that happened a thousand years before the campaign started. It closed all lose ends we had up to that point and was completely improvised. More than GMing I just facilitated and played a single character chosed randomly. All we needed was to give the players some constraints for their characters. Up to this date it remains as one of the best RPG experiences we ever had.<br/><br/>Now I still GM more or less traditionally, I make prep, but improvisation and player input is a huge deal in our games. I learned to enjoy and expect the unexpected, let the players come up with the solutions, prep the bangs and let players come up with their own kicks, with a little aid to make them more dramatic. Now my prep only adds quality to the material instead of trying to add interest, motivate the players or herd them anywhere.                        </div>

                            I think you are oversimplifying that last point, Brendan;  Yes, lots of stories feature teams or groups of characters, but most of those stories don't involve those characters being together the vast majority of the time.  There is definitely something different between a traditional "RPG party" and, oh, The Avengers, or the cast of Elementary or something (sorry, I'm super not up on television.).  Even the quintessential "party" -- the Fellowship of the Ring -- only stuck together for one of six books. <br/><br/>I'd also contest the assertion that early D&amp;D wasn't "challenge based".<br/><br/>But I believe you have a strong point in that most people playing D&amp;D aren't playing it to learn more about their characters.                        </div>

                            That's definitely true, Airk. Even the most ensemble-focused stories have scenes of just one or two of the main characters interacting with side characters and cameo characters who in an rpg paradigm would be NPC, and scenes of characters alone.                        </div>

In a lot of campaigns the party splits at various points. But the fact that you have 3-6 players sitting at a table together playing, is the reason in RPGs that characters will often stick together. But again this really is dependent on the campaign. There is nothing inherent to the GM and the party that prevents you from having characters in different places or pursuing different goals. The only thing that is going to limit that is the fact that you have 3-6 people sitting together at a table who may want to have their character do something rather than wait for another person to do so. But I just ran a campaign with 4 players where there was effectively a 3 way split at multiple points in the campaign over pretty substantial distance. <br/><br/>Still though, I don't think you lose much if you are trying to emulate Lord of the Rings but keep the party together for convenience (it is a perfectly functional approach to play). <br/><br/>Also in fiction and movies there are trends. Right now we are heavy into a single character POV trend where you often get large numbers of characters slowly progressing slices of the story at a time. But that hasn't always been the norm. <br/> </div>

                            3-6 players is in my eyes so many for a campaign, at least compared to what I'm used to. <br/>My group and I is 3 players including me, with one of those players in a non-GM world-playing role (specifically the HG in Chuubo's), so 2 PCs in a campaign. <br/>More would get very crowded and cramped for me personally, and to keep up the standards we have for our character-focused play, our sessions would need to be hugely long to accomodate more players, because we believe in each PC-playing player being allocated at least 2.5-3 hours of content focused on their character - scenes they frame that are focused on their character specifically - per session. With 2 PCs, that makes for 5-6 hour sessions, and with 3 PCs that would jump up to 7.5-9 hour sessions, and with 4 it would jump up to 10-12 hour sessions.                         </div>

                            The only problem you actually have when the party splits is that some people won't play for a while, and watching other people play without the ability to intervene at all is somewhat boring, unless the players involved are good at entertaining others, which is rare from my experience.<br/><br/>I made an experiment when hacking Tenra by giving the players a deck of cards with instruction to give them the control of different things in the scene. If their characters weren't in the scene they could pick up a card and use the instructions there to add something to the scene. We agreed that as a GM I couls always use, built over, disregard or edit their input, but otherwise they could participate in the scene even if their characters weren't there.<br/><br/>The experiment was a success, players not in the scene could do things like describe a minor detail there that the GM could build over, like a noise, a smell, an aura, the weather. They could take control of a minor NPC as long as they did something specific with it, like die a gruesome death, deliver a message or participate in a conversation. They could even get to control a minion, elite or boss monster in a fight against another PC or group of PCs. It was amazing how players added difficulty instead of making things easy in purpose for other players. The effect in the end was that players were always engaged and enjoying the game instead of dropping their attention into their cellphones while their turn to play came, and the scenes become more interesting because of that.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to codify this into a game of my own.                        </div>

                            Watching and playing to entertain each other is so much fun in my experience, but that might be a product of that my playstyle is very focused on acting, and we're all very focused on producing well-written and interesting fiction, and we're all very engrossed in seeing how the story develops, and how it's written. <br/>We all deeply care about each other's characters, so we're super super invested in seeing the scenes with them, because we love them as much as we love our own characters.<br/><br/>We also sometimes play NPCs in scenes our PCs aren't in, but that's more just a thing we do now and then because we find it fun, instead of being a thing to keep us focused. It's also kind of rare. In my group, PC-playing players are usually only playing 1-2 NPCs in a campaign, whereas a world-player is playing dozens of them. Often the NPCs that PC-playing players are playing are NPCs who were given to us because we did some casual freeform in between sessions where we played them and liked one person's performance in particular (because we do a lot of non-canon freeform in between our sessions to play out interactions we're interested in seeing hypothetically but that don't fit into the story, what-if scenarios, and hypothetical drafts for future scenes) or because the world-playing player was having difficulty working out how to play an NPC who one of the PC-playing players had written into their story, and one of the PC-playing players had a really strong idea for how to play the character.<br/><br/>For instance in our current campaign, the other PC-playing player's NPC is my PC's boyfriend, who she ended up assigned to play because there was a time before we introduced the character in the fiction where she was playing the character in a freeform scene with my character just to feel out how their interactions feel (because they're childhood friends), and we all loved her performance in the role so much that we "cast" her in that role (with the world-playing player taking over the role of the character in scenes where her PC is interacting with him). <br/>The NPC who I play in this campaign is one of her PC's girlfriends, who the world-playing player was struggling to conceptualize how to play, and it was getting really close to the point where she was going to debut in the campaign, and she still couldn't figure out how to make the character the PC-playing player had handed to her work, and she asked me my opinion on how to play the character, and I started freeforming as that character as an example of the sort of image for her that was in my head, and she liked my interpretation of the NPC so much that she asked me if I'd take on that role in any scene that the NPC was in (with the world-playing player taking over the role of the character in scenes where my PC is interacting with her).                        </div>

                            Heres a 20,000 ft view.     (bear with me, longish point to make)<br/><br/> Roleplaying is a tiny niche hobby like the way boardgames used to be.  But now boardgames are a large niche hobby, if that makes sense.  In my homecity of melbourne, I can go to a handful of venues on any given night where large numbers of strangers gather to boardgame on a casual basis - the one I choose is a japanese restaurant that fills its 80 seat capacity twice a week, every week, on tuesdays and thursdays.<br/><br/>The main difference, IMO, is that boardgames evolved to become much more accessible and just generally a better baseline experience for people.  You can sit at a table of strangers and expect to be taught a new game in 20 minutes, and expect it to be a reasonable amount of fun, possibly a great deal of fun, for the next 1 - 3 hours.  Its rare that a game brought to the table sucks.  Most noob walk-ins leave at the end of the night with a smile and a 'see you next week'.<br/><br/>Now honestly contrast that with RPGs.  The internet and then kickstarter helped boardgames a lot, but roleplaying has been exposed to those as well.<br/><br/>The main difference is that boardgames have evolved to become more accessible and just generally better designed to give at least an OK experience at a minimum.  Why cant RPGs do the same - because of their intrinsic nature? <br/><br/>Certainly the intrinsic nature of the single GM system that the gateway D&amp;D uses seems to preclude it.  <br/><br/>The single GM system relies on that person to an amazing degree, they are the single most important factor in the experience for the other players by a huge margin.  I would suggest that the 'experience chart' for trad 1GM games looks like this.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePIeNQOgmvU8Am9QneQFXBTpPbTh0gz7/view" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePIeNQOgmvU8Am9QneQFXBTpPbTh0gz7/view</a><br/><br/>where red is RPG and blue is BG, and the areas under the curve are not drawn to scale (blue would be way off the chart in terms of quantity compared to red)<br/><br/>OK, so I have nothing but anecdotal evidence to back that up.<br/><br/>So I get that there are people out there that regualrly live in that top quartile of player experience on the red line, and they point out that what happens in that area of the chart relies on a single GM to pull off, BUT - from the 20000 ft view, its aways going to be a small area because of that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            I really, really, <i>really</i> like party play.  There are a million ways it can go awry, but when it works, you get maximum player interaction, with everyone contributing at all times.  I don't think doing it well is trivially easy, just like I don't think GMing is trivially easy, but it is <i>so worth it</i> if you can pull it off.  I can name a ton of techniques I employ to foster this sort of interaction -- it's definitely doable.                        </div>

time window for sure.    There are 'legacy' boardgames but they are few and far between.  Most boardgames cater to the casual gaming experience where 3 hours is considered a long game, and then youre done.<br/><br/>win conditions, not so much.  boardgames have always had win conditions but they havent always been as popular and accessible as they are now, except for that niche of 'supermarket' games such as monopoly where accessibility was always the top priority.                        </div>

I do create roleplaying games like that, and experienced roleplaying gamers are amazed when I tell them that it takes 1,5 hours to learn, to create characters and an adventure, and play through it.<br/><br/>I added win condition (more like "end condition") to my games. I added time constraints. I added a procedural loop that continuously occurs through play. Funny thing though, This is Pulp have a game master, but it's more a asymmetric player role with no real authority other than being the person that explains the rules.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.urverkspel.com/component/jdownloads/category/15-ovriga-projekt" rel="nofollow">The Murder of Mr. Crow</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19869/imagine-using-my-own-theory-to-create-it" rel="nofollow">Imagine</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17608/this-is-pulp-the-structure-of-the-rulebook" rel="nofollow">This is Pulp</a> </div>

(bear with me, longish point to make)<br/><br/> Roleplaying is a tiny niche hobby like the way boardgames used to be.  But now boardgames are a large niche hobby, if that makes sense.  In my homecity of melbourne, I can go to a handful of venues on any given night where large numbers of strangers gather to boardgame on a casual basis - the one I choose is a japanese restaurant that fills its 80 seat capacity twice a week, every week, on tuesdays and thursdays.<br/><br/>The main difference, IMO, is that boardgames evolved to become much more accessible and just generally a better baseline experience for people.  You can sit at a table of strangers and expect to be taught a new game in 20 minutes, and expect it to be a reasonable amount of fun, possibly a great deal of fun, for the next 1 - 3 hours.  Its rare that a game brought to the table sucks.  Most noob walk-ins leave at the end of the night with a smile and a 'see you next week'.<br/><br/>Now honestly contrast that with RPGs.  The internet and then kickstarter helped boardgames a lot, but roleplaying has been exposed to those as well.<br/><br/>The main difference is that boardgames have evolved to become more accessible and just generally better designed to give at least an OK experience at a minimum.  Why cant RPGs do the same - because of their intrinsic nature? <br/><br/>Certainly the intrinsic nature of the single GM system that the gateway D&amp;D uses seems to preclude it.  <br/><br/>The single GM system relies on that person to an amazing degree, they are the single most important factor in the experience for the other players by a huge margin.  I would suggest that the 'experience chart' for trad 1GM games looks like this.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePIeNQOgmvU8Am9QneQFXBTpPbTh0gz7/view" rel="nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePIeNQOgmvU8Am9QneQFXBTpPbTh0gz7/view</a><br/><br/>where red is RPG and blue is BG, and the areas under the curve are not drawn to scale (blue would be way off the chart in terms of quantity compared to red)<br/><br/>OK, so I have nothing but anecdotal evidence to back that up.<br/><br/>So I get that there are people out there that regualrly live in that top quartile of player experience on the red line, and they point out that what happens in that area of the chart relies on a single GM to pull off, BUT - from the 20000 ft view, its aways going to be a small area because of that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div></blockquote>
I would say a few things to this. First, I don't your chart on player satisfaction is accurate. I've seen too many players who enjoy a typical RPG session to agree with that breakdown. Not saying my experience is the norm either, just I think people tend to project their own experience onto that, and their own preferences. Second, I think this idea that if RPGs were only more accessible and made like European Boardgames (which have a philosophy of keeping the game entertaining at every point as much as possible and a highly developed idea of design) they would become much more popular is misguided. People have been trying to make RPGs accessible for a very long time. And people have tried to make RPGs function more like board games. I don't think that works for growing the hobby. All it does is lose the interest of the bulk of players who like way RPGs operate and/or create a new niche for the kinds of games you are talking about designing (or you just end up developing a new useful tool that regular RPGs can absorb). You can also shorten the length of an RPG to play more like a boardgames, but then you lose the organic appeal so many people come to traditional RPGs for in the first place. Third, not everyone appreciates recent developments in board game design. I used to play lots of board games in the 80s and 90s. But as a lot of board game design evolved, I found myself less and less interested (particularly when games did things like keep players actively engaged and gave them a shot at winning from start to finish). I liked older style strategy games, with large boards and pieces that were less abstract. The newer games just don't engage me the same way the older ones did (not all of course, I realize there are lots of board games out there and I've played new Board Games that I like). The bottom line for me is when I play an RPG I am not really looking for a pick-up style play, where the whole thing is wrapped up in 1-3 hours. And I am not looking for built in safeties to make sure the players have fun and the GM doesn't do things the designers don't want. Much of the draw, for both players and GMs in my view, is the freedom to use the game in our own way. I think the danger of boring moments or strands leading no where, is what makes the game so great. It makes it much more meaningful when you have those big moments. It also takes a lot of the pressure off. I think the chart you made also reveals something about expectations. My experience, and I encounter this on traditional RPG forums as well, is some people walk around with an over idealized sense of a good RPG experience. They want the perfect GM, they want an amazing story, thrilling combats, etc. But if you set your expectations a little more realistically and relax, remembering this is just a game, it becomes a lot more enjoyable. I.E. if you are constantly critiquing the experience of play, you will constantly find problems.                          </div>

                            I think the things Brendan just described all go well together.  Freedom, a risk of aimlessness, a relaxed attitude, large time blocks, and an experience that isn't tailored for pick-up play -- this is a coherent RPG culture that doesn't need any "fixes".<br/><br/>That said, I do <i>not</i> think it is mainstream-accessible at all.<br/><br/>I think it'd be cool if games like Rickard's, which I imagine <i>might</i> be more mainstream-accessible, also caught on, albeit probably with a different audience.<br/><br/>There's a game product called Shindig Machine which I've played at a bunch of board game nights.  The fun lies in making up stories and optionally occasionally speaking in the voice of an imaginary character.  It is extremely accessible.  It takes about 15 minutes to play each mini-game in the booklet, and then if you like you can play a different mini-game.  It's improv theater sitting at a table, basically.<br/><br/>My experience with a crowd of people who are there to play board games, is that most of them are happy to make stuff up and/or "have a character" (in some fashion) for 15-30 minutes, but only a few of them want more than those 15-30 minutes.  I think sometimes it's hard for those of us who love RPGs to realize that for a lot of people out there, making stuff up is draining (even if you're just making up the actions of an imaginary avatar).  For this reason I don't ever expect RPGs to become as popular as board games, and I don't think that's a sign of anything wrong with any particular RPGs.<br/><br/>I do think D&amp;D makes a pretty lousy poster child on the accessibility front, though, with the daunting complexity of most editions.                        </div>

The fun lies in making up stories and optionally occasionally speaking in the voice of an imaginary character.  It is extremely accessible.  It takes about 15 minutes to play each mini-game in the booklet, and then if you like you can play a different mini-game.  It's improv theater sitting at a table, basically.<br/><br/>My experience with a crowd of people who are there to play board games, is that most of them are happy to make stuff up and/or "have a character" (in some fashion) for 15-30 minutes, but only a few of them want more than those 15-30 minutes.  I think sometimes it's hard for those of us who love RPGs to realize that for a lot of people out there, making stuff up is draining (even if you're just making up the actions of an imaginary avatar).  For this reason I don't ever expect RPGs to become as popular as board games, and I don't think that's a sign of anything wrong with any particular RPGs.<br/>.</p></div></blockquote>
What I am saying isn't really at odds with this. I think you can make, and people do make, more accessible, faster paced games that are geared for a more mainstream audience. But those exist, as you point out. Yet they haven't really changed the landscape much. And it feels like the more mainstream you want the game to be, the less like a roleplaying game it has to be. <br/><br/>Keep in mind there have been booms in the past with games like this. And I do think there are untapped audiences. I know for instance that my aunt had a ton of bookshelf mystery boardgames from the 70s that basically meant to emulate being Sherlock Holmes and other mysteries. They veered heavily into RP territory. And my aunt and her friends were the furthest thing from gamers (she just really liked mystery novels). <br/><br/>Also, we are presently in the middle of probably the largest boom for RPGs (I don't know if it is bigger than the one we had in the early 80s, and I wouldn't know how to determine that, but culturally if feels like D&amp;D is gaining a lot of attention and reaching a much wider audience). So for all its lack of accessibility people like to point to, clearly there is something about this game that registers with folks from time to time. And it is possible that the lack of accessibility, the sense that it is not a normal or typical game, is the very thing that attracts people to it when that happens. <br/><br/>EDIT: Just want to add, there was a huge trend of accessible beer and pretzel RPGs from the mid-90s or so to the early 2000s. I used to play those kinds of games as a supplement to regular RPGs. Basically they made a great pick-up game when your whole crew couldn't make it and you wanted something that felt like an RPG but didn't take a huge investment of prep. But those only really seemed to catch on with people who played RPGs anyways.                         </div>

                            Brendan, agreed, sounds like we're basically on the same page.<br/><br/>I remember How to Host a Murder Mystery in department stores, and also an old "beer &amp; pretzels" game or two.<br/><br/>I think D&amp;D has made huge recent inroads in terms of acceptance and presence in American culture, basically thanks to a small handful of pretty famous entertainers and a much larger handful of less famous entertainers.  Destigmatizing D&amp;D and mentioning it in pop culture has <i>got</i> to expand the potential player pool.  Shows like Critical Role have already made D&amp;D more popular than I would have guessed, but I have no idea how many of the hobby's new fans are actually playing.  I was surprised when I mentioned RPGs at a frisbee game recently how two players liked listening to actual play series on YouTube but didn't have much interest in trying it themselves.                        </div>

This game came out before How to Host a Murder Mystery. The presentation was less sleek and came with a map of the mystery location (think it was a major or small English village). I wish I remembered the name.                        </div>

Plenty of products attract popular attention without relying on D&amp;D to gain notice. If mainstream people are not taking an interest it may mean the market for what you are seeking to do is simply smaller than you thought (I think you are elevating D&amp;D to a bogey man that you can blame). Sometimes you just have to accept you are writing for a niche audience. Attacking mainstream tastes isn’t going to help a niche product break through. If anything, you should be using the name recognition of D&amp;D as a starting point to connect with people (I.e. gave you heard of D&amp;D? Well this is like that game but does X instead).                         </div>

                            Trying to get a bit back to the OP idea, you can say that if an RPG needs a GM in control and having full responsability, that's actually a point against new players that want to get into the hobby. That appeals to players that look for an activity a bit more complex as it's an skill that requires more time to be learned. Of course, the rewards are more than worthy, but basically there's no intuitive way to become a good GM, it's mostly try and error. <br/><br/>Most RPG rule books explain it badly so most often you have to learn by looking someone else do it, or try to figure things out from APs. Once you do things may become clearer, but you will surely inherit most of the mistakes and assumptions of the people you learned from.<br/><br/>Simplifying and limiting the game to turn it into a "beer &amp; pretzels" game of course won't do the trick, as that mutilates the whole experience. Look closely: on boardgames, and specially in "beer &amp; pretzels" ones the conversation doesn't take place on a shared fictional space. It revolves around the game subject but it's not at all like an actual RPG. The Reference Data is also limited to the game components as you can't usually bring anything from the outside without disrupting the game process.<br/><br/>Tools from boardgames may still be used, but if the whole process doesn't include a conversation revolving about a shared fiction then it's more a boardgame than an RPG, which may still be cool but won't help the hobby at all.<br/><br/>I'd say that if you really need to make the hobby more popular you could try working on the general efficiency of the design, like lessen the learning curve and getting players to achieve flow faster. And this has nothing to do with making the game less complex, it's more about making it quick to understand and getting rid of all the useless extra steps to get something fun happening at the table. <br/><br/>Critical Role would be great at explaining the game if it didn't set false expectations about how it plays at the table. Their videos are edited and the things that happen at the table are somewhat scripted, players collaborate to add drama, but still I find it boring to watch. Still, I'm glad it's getting attention and changing the face of the hobby. It's an effort that needs to be taken, as no revolutionary new RPG will be able to change the stigma over the hobby from one day to the other. Not changing things at all will just reinforce the stigma anyway, so I'd say all experiments are welcome.<br/><br/>Yet it's not like we're disrespecting tradition nor throwing away anything. OSR rules.                        </div>

On a <i>person-to-person</i> level, I agree.  <a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a> I have actually used this to pitch RPGs to new people.  If they seem like more of the casual boardgamer sort, I might say something like, "This is kind of like Dungeons and Dragons, but there are no complex rules, it's mostly just creating an adventure story.  There might or might not be fights depending on what you choose to do."  And then get on to the real thing that hooks most people, which is flavor: "Steampunk Firefly" or "Medieval X-Files" or whatever.<br/><br/>As for the <i>marketing &amp; advertising</i> level, I don't really know.  I suspect that RPGs which are vastly unlike D&amp;D might do better to call themselves something other than "roleplaying games".                        </div>

                            And (on a different agenda here) what if it actually took less to be a GM, as responsabilities get distributed among the players?.

Why can't we use questions to inspire and help players focus instead of straight demanding creative outbursts from them in order to get quality material? <br/><br/>I mean, of course I'm talking of a different creative agenda here, but game procedures can be set to save time and effort to the players, to require less investment from them and still offer the same game experience that you get with a GM specialized in either entertainment, tactical expertise, adjudication, etc. Couple that with a explanation more focused on procedures than in actual rules, make that explanation visual, dynamic, either a comic or video. Even better video, as this media captures best all the small nuances involved with ritual phrases and other ways to convey information like the differences in tone and timing, gestures, etc.<br/><br/>Actually, why do we keep using books mostly to explain RPGs?<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just too much derrailing, but thanks David, this gave me another idea <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>

                            I feel like a game procedures to make players not have to be as invested are contradictory to the goal of roleplaying together. <br/>Player investment is a good thing. Players having to put in work is a good thing, because all hobbies take work to do them properly. RPGs are like every other hobby in that way.<br/><br/>Personally, if every designer quit explaining RPGs through books, I would never play a new RPG ever again, because I can't learn from video or whatever, and learn exceedingly well from books.                        </div>

                            I think, "player investment" is a good word... probably a term that rather lends itself to consensus than "player empowerment". I´m thinking about some design strategies from indie games, that could be helpful even for a D&amp;D Dungeonmaster to keep a less motivated group at it.<br/><br/> </div>

Ugh, sorry, I made a wrong choice of words. I meant it as in investment of time, as in "RPGs shouldn't take so much time to master", not as in "players shouldn't invest in the game". I'm all about plares investing in the game, but opposed to wasting time to understand it and get into the experience.<br/><br/>And yes <a href="/forums/profile/Stefoid">@Stefoid</a>, I was thinking on how questions and other things can be used as contraints to help focus and inspire the players <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/chiarina">@chiarina</a> , exactly! As an example, it meant a whole new experience for me when I finally understood the PbtA core where the GM doesn't roll dice, but makes a move when players roll a miss. You can couple that with an initiative mechanic based on adjuticating it first to either those who answer first the GM's question or those whose fiction demands to answer first and then move to the more passive players. <br/><br/>The effect is fast-paced, full of action combat where surprisingly nobody really steals the spotlight and everyone gets their chance. You can even allow players to attack or roll dice more than once as they are risking a GM move by that. On top of that combat and other challenges narration fits seamlessly with the rest of the game conversation. <br/><br/>Before PbtA I couldn't imagine a way to get rid of all the time spent between turns, doing nothing. Or that instead of saying to the player "you miss" and going to the next one on a failed roll I could narrate how cool/lucky the NPCs were despite all the heroes tricks. I mean, I thought that I had to wait for my turn and hope to roll a 20 to get to describe how fearsome were the enemies. Now I do that even with trad games and I've never just say "you miss" to any player ever again.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a> the games exist but... I dunno, I feel like part of the <i>tools</i> are there, but it's still not enough. Like, It took a few years, hacks and reviews for me to finally get PbtA, though I never got the fx stuff nor the clocks. World of Dungeons was the hack that finally got me into it and even then I never got into running or playing it as it was. Archipielago had this amazing idea of ritualphrases and more, but it wasn't a setting or genre or agenda I was interested into. Microscope was amazing too but I was already writing comics in freeform with my group. My group prefers trad games, so I often ended up hacking these tools into trad games with a bit more familiar mechanics. <br/><br/>That made click for us. Intuitive, familiar stuff. But I admit that it's just my personal preferences.<br/><br/>Now, I'd say that because games like this already had their chance and no revolution seems to had taken place it doesn't mean that they hadn't done anything. I mean, aren't we asking too much from them? D&amp;D has been around for ages and it's not like it has become more popular than soccer. If any change is gonna take place, no matter how revolutionary is the game used to start it, this change is going to be like, geologically slow. We got too much competition as a media and as a mean of entertainment. The core values and rewards of this hobby are still solid gold against most of the competition, but they are hard to get and explain.<br/> </div>

I guess what I am saying is the reason you feel they are languishing, may not be because people haven’t heard of them. But if that is the only thing stopping them from smashing into the mainstream, people can put effort in to spread the word beyond RPG circles. I just think blaming D&amp;D for the failure of other games to attract a larger audience makes little sense                        </div>

                            There are 'story board games' out there that have gained traction because of the fact that they <b>are</b> labelled as story board games.  Currently 'Dead of Winter' is a hit.  Not sure how many sales, but Im betting it would blow 99% of rpg games out of the water and its only 1 board game amongst a deluge that comes out every year with a similar theme.  So it has climbed to prominence in the board game world precisely because of its 'story telling chops' not in spite of them.<br/><br/>And its pretty rubbish, both as a board game and a story game, IMO.<br/><br/>So board game buyers are up for it, even if just for the novelty factor.  <br/>designers will explore the space in search of something that isnt yet another area control game with minis or  euro-styled exercise in bean-counting.                        </div>

That is my point. If it hasn't been done, then it is possible this just a niche within a niche. Things could change or maybe there is a huge chunk of the mainstream who would be interested but just haven't heard of them yet. But I find the latter a highly questionable assumption at this stage. Again things can always change as the culture changes. And there may always be people that just haven't been reached because of messaging and marketing (but again, not seeing D&amp;D as the hindrance if that is the case). <br/><br/>I am puzzled why D&amp;D is seen as the thing that would both have the potential to catapult these ideas to success and be holding these ideas back. This is the part of the argument that confuses me. More than that though, I think it is one of the things that contributes to the division among gamers. <br/><br/>If people continue to use D&amp;D as a proxy here, seeing it as the thing your given play style and design philosophy needs to take control of in order to have your ideas gain wider acceptance, you'll continue to see resentment between the groups of gamers who abide by different approaches to play. Certainly you can see how "we need to get our ideas into D&amp;D to gain acceptance" fits right into some of the concerns people have there are flame wars between say story gamers and traditional gamers. My view with D&amp;D is it should have whatever mechanics and concepts it needs to remain the largest RPG in the hobby. Remember, they lost a lot of the hobby to Paizo when 4E came out and Paizo continued to essentially publish 3rd edition. They had to bring a lot of gamers together in order to make 5E have broad enough appeal. D&amp;D is never going to be hyper focused because it is meant to be played by all kinds of gamers. That is why old school people can look at it and see something familiar, 3E and 4E people can look and see something they recognize and why the indie and story game crowd can also see elements they know as well. They didn't make it 100% old school, or 100% narrative, because they couldn't. They are not making a single serve game to taste. They are making something more like a meal for the whole family. Any product that has that as an aim (which D&amp;D almost by definition has to) is going to cast a much wider net and not be as appealing to someone with very specific tastes.                         </div>

There are brands synonymous with types of products the same way D&amp;D is synonymous with role playing game: Band-Aid, Q-tip, google (I will ‘google’ that), etc.                         </div>

                            To respond to the core topic here:<br/><br/>I think the root of everything that is wrong with rpgs is mismatched expectations between players.  The GM role can either patch that problem or make it worse.  When players expect one type of play (genre-homage, collaborative drama creation, strategic puzzle) and get another, it is jarring.  The GM can use their disproportionate influence over the flow of play to keep things coherent or they can use all kinds of bad behaviors to make players feel that their input and choices don't really matter.<br/><br/>Dissonant expectations can happen in games with or without GMs.  Some great games solve this in their structure, some great groups solve this among themselves.  I'd say the most reliable fix for this kind of dissonance is well-written rules with clearly delineated authority over the details of play.  Many styles of play work best when a chunk of (narrative or mechanical) authority is located in a GM role, others work better without it.                        </div>

                            Attaching your product to a core brand is a double-edge sword. If you handle it correctly you can steal insatisfied clients from that brand.

I mean, if you watch soccer starting from the middle of a game you realize you have to kick the ball into the other team's goal and after a while, if you're lucky, you get immersed into the emotions this struggle projects and get the idea. If you watch a tabletop rpg session without knowing what's about you will notice that someone is speaking more than the others and seems to be playing god. Then they roll the dice (and why does it need such strange dice?) and shout, laugh or a mix of those and more.

And even then I didn't know how it worked, or that the GM wasn't god, or that railroading, illusionism and quantum ogres were bad. Heck, I didn't even knew the actual game rules. Can't really blame anyone who says that this is a complicate game, even when now we know it's no rocket science.<br/><br/>-<b>It takes how long?</b> If you get into a game and notice just creating the character takes an hour (oh yeah, you can use pregens or get help to reduce it to minutes, but for trad games that's definitely not enough to understand and assimilate all the things your character can and can't do) and that everyone has to create their characters too, and next that the adventure can take forever... well it may feel for some people that they are being asked to compromise a lot of their time in the future. <br/><br/>That's something that usually scares those who try a first session but don't get enough fun to dare try another, which is often the case when all the first session is spent creating the characters and not having the actual fun.

If this was 1980, I'd think you have more of a point. But there are endless varieties of RPGs now. People have pointed out countless RPGs exist that address the complaints raised. So if what you are saying is true, all of these problems are easily overcome and you should be recruiting more players. Yet D&amp;D continues to be the game people gravitate to. All I am saying is this: consider the possibility that the things you are filing under complexity, or betrayed expectations, may actually be part of the mystique and draw of D&amp;D. When people come to D&amp;D or RPGs who haven't played them, they often do so consciously aware that this is a 'nerdy' activity. And neediness is associated with things like complexity. <br/><br/>And if people are coming to the table to play, and D&amp;D is too complicated for them, this isn't the pre-internet age. Making people aware of alternatives to D&amp;D that area easier, more story focused, or otherwise something you regard as having more mainstream appeal, that is a very easy message to get out. I think the reality is fewer people may be interested in this than you realize (trust me I've been there, I tried recruiting tons of non-gamers and presenting people with simpler more intuitive systems, and I found the appetite for the experience that is roleplaying, is smaller than I'd like it to be). That can change. Attitudes and interests can change. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I think if you want to make different kinds of RPGs that might have more mainstream appeal, that is great. I think it is laudable to do so. But I think it is incredibly self defeating, and also something that turns off mainstream recruits, if you start blaming people in the hobby, blaming D&amp;D, or blaming potential recruits for not being interested. At a certain point, you should be open to the possibility that the kinds of games you are talking about (the ones you think have huge mainstream potential) are actually more of a niche than traditional RPGs---or a similar niche. There is nothing wrong with that. But if that is the reality and you are railing against all these things, you are only doing harm.                         </div>

Heck, it wouldn't shock me if the majority of board games sold based on flavor rather than rules, and moving from (a) story-evoking flavor to (b) actual bits of story isn't a huge jump IMO.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter was pitched to me more on situation and game premise than as some sort of story creation engine.  I thought there was some excellent story fodder in there, but the process for bringing it out and making it matter was pretty weak.  So, if it is a hit, it would be quite baffling to me if it's a hit <i>because</i> of its story-making chops.<br/><br/>I think Tales of the Arabian Nights is a better example.  The pursuit of victory is both simple and highly random, and the bulk of play consists of navigating to the next vignette to read out to the group.  I enjoyed the game, but it scratched roughly 5% of the urge that leads me to RPGs.  House-ruling in some player contributions to the vignette-reading might get me closer, though.                        </div>

Spot on.<br/><br/>The videogame industry seems a good example of what you say here. Back in the 80s/90s you had a lot really complex games and specially RPGs. The more popular and mainstream the industry got though, the more simple games started to make the norm while complex or baroque or too slow genres fell by the way side. These days classic (and complex) electronic RPGs like Ultimas or Baldurs Gates are rare BUT it's central ideas live on in genres that mixed it with more immediate traits, like action games or immersive shooters (see how Zelda and Dark Souls - predominately action games - inherited a lot of RPG traits).<br/><br/>So in a way, the videogame industry had to address it's share of issues (mostly related to accessibility and quality of time, not too different from the points you make above) in order to become mainstream. <br/><br/>The question then is: can we do the same with our hobby while keeping it's essential identifiable traits?                         </div>

                            I still really think you are being shortsighted here Brendan;  It's not that people are "blaming D&amp;D" in some specific sense, but that people are realizing how hard it is to get past that 900lb gorilla far enough for people to even weigh in on whether a game is better or not.<br/><br/>Remember: Consumers can't have an opinion on your product unless they know about it.   And if they think they already do, they're not going to look into it.<br/><br/>To reiterate: You say "All these ideas have been tried and none of them have done as well as D&amp;D, so D&amp;D must be some sort of magical experience that cannot be improved upon."  I say "None of these ideas have actually been tried, because for them to be tried, people would have needed a degree of exposure that they cannot get in the current marketplace."<br/><br/>Is this changing? Maybe. But your points about Pathfinder seem to miss the point there.,                        </div>

By "Here" I meant my country, Peru, where neither D&amp;D nor any other game has ever had major distribution nor exposure. There are players yes, but nobody has edited D&amp;D nor any other tabletop RPG in my country. Boardgame design is in it's infancy here. So I suppose you could call it the 80's here in that sense. We're no model of what should be done nor have too much experience with an RPG industry, but it's like we're a special study case here.<br/><br/>I mean, we don't have all the negative stigma per se, and the recent positive publicity is barely catching on. Tabletop entertainment is slowly becoming a thing here with many small clubs appearing here and there. Most of them have groups playing D&amp;D and other games. It's a blank slate.<br/><br/>However the stigmas are still there, though they are more like the first negative reaction from the audience once they are exposed to it than a prejudice whenever they heard about tabletop RPGs. Whenever they heard of them their reaction is 99% of the time a "whaaaat?" and the rest come later, once they are faced with a somewhat complicated explanation that still doesn't click in their minds, until they dare to play the game.<br/><br/>So I can't help but wonder, what could happen if the first tabletop RPG the audience gets exposed to is an indie game, with distributed responsabilities, fast-paced action, more accesibility, well explained, etc.? If I had the money I would print and distribute it for free at schools and universities, then wait to see what happens. I'm ready to accept if 99% of that ends up in the garbage, but it may work. Maybe they will get interested in trying more complex games, made their own, who knows?<br/><br/>I've been around enough time (late Forge days) to realize that all games are different for a good reason, that you can't design "the best game ever that everyone would love and make them ditch all the others". I just like my games being efficient at particular tasks and I realize that you can't get there without sacrificing parts of the experience. But that's ok, there are other games that fill the spot I'm not filling. Still haven't found a game that scratches the itch I have, though many have gotten pretty close.<br/><br/>I like D&amp;D as it is. Without a DM it wouldn't be D&amp;D at all. No one is changing that... well maybe WotC on their next edition but then it would be another, different game and another edition war. We could try my plan with D&amp;D but why can't we try a different thing instead? <br/> </div>

I think I am just being realistic. We may just have to disagree on some of this. I believe lots of people have been exposed to the kinds of games you are pushing for, and that there probably isn't much more of an audience out there for them. I think it is a niche within a niche. <br/><br/>But what do you want specifically? What is it you would like to see happen and what do you think the result will be (and why)?

This isn't what I am saying. I am saying because D&amp;D is the biggest game, and needs to retain the largest customer base possible, it is unlikely you are going to see massive shifts toward one style or another. You are only going to see as much OSR, Story Game, Optimization, that will draw in enough people from those quadrants of the hobby without pushing away people from other quadrants. What I am saying is D&amp;D has an existing customer base. That base has certain expectations and is also made up of a wide variety of player types. If they put all their eggs in the Indie Game basket, as you are suggesting, they risk losing a substantial core of their audience. Is it possible they could bring in more non-gamers with the design philosophy you are advocating? Maybe. I don't think so personally. I think the desire for that kind of RPG isn't as large as you believe. And I think the risk for WOTC is just too big (particularly when you have the example of 4E trying to do something like that, and immediately splitting the customer base in half). <br/><br/>And to respond to the second point here: I do think these ideas have been tried. People have already mentioned countless examples on this thread of such games. Most RPG players have heard of them at this point. Many have played them. If there truly is an untapped market for them, and they are not connecting to the games because they simply haven't heard of them, well that is the fault of the people who make the games and haven't found a way tell them. If it is so new, and so great, and so innovative and brilliant, it should be easy. But ask yourself, is there really a large untapped segment of the population who wants to sit down and play this kind of game OR is it maybe just the kind of game that appeals to a narrow audience of like-minded nerdy-folk? <br/><br/>I just don't get the whole "It should be bigger than D&amp;D but for D&amp;D" argument. It doesn't make sense to me.                         </div>

The pursuit of victory is both simple and highly random, and the bulk of play consists of navigating to the next vignette to read out to the group.

Seeking a new audience makes sense to me. My only quibble with that idea, and it is really more an opinion than a quibble, is I believe there probably isn't a very large new audience to be found at the present moment. I think the part I don't understand is the fixation with D&amp;D being the key to attaining a new audience. I am not saying you were making this argument. But if Airk's idea is, we need D&amp;D to adopt our approach, because D&amp;D has the name recognition, so that our approach can be introduced to a mainstream audience (even if that means existing D&amp;D players and GMs are effectively given an edition they don't want and won't play)...it should be no surprise to people if there is conflict in the gaming community because it is being treated as a zero sum game. Now I am not saying this is the argument the poster was necessarily making (the reason I asked for specifics was because I thought this seemed to be the argument but I wasn't sure).                         </div>

                            I'm just catching up on this discussion, and I find it to be a very interesting one. I largely agree with both sides, and don't see their positions as mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>I also used to think that lighter, more focused design would easily sway people from older, more traditional design. I still don't know if this is true, because it has had exactly that effect for many gamers (and non-gamers) I know, but there also many people for whom its features are not appealing (and, I suspect, the reasons differ for each particular gamer).<br/><br/>I DO think that traditional roleplaying appeals to the people who like it on the basis of its particulars, and a GM who oversees the "reality" you interact with is a big part of that; simply designing more procedural or democratic games doesn't <i>improve</i> on that experience so much as it <i>changes</i> it.<br/><br/>At the same time, though, it's true that the design of "traditional" RPGs (I somewhat exclude old-school adventure gaming from this category) leans heavily on very specific and uncodified GM skills, and I have no doubt that this leads to some bad gaming and some bad experiences, and creates a high barrier to entry. In this sense, yes, "the concept of a GM is at the root of everything that is wrong with RPGs". Absolutely.<br/><br/>Density of rules, limited genre material (many/most people just aren't interested in dungeons and wizards), and an overly complex entry point (e.g. I'm an experienced gamer with a long attention span, and I struggled to make a D&amp;D5 character from the book - and that's seen as the simplest version of the game by many people!) limit the accessibility of D&amp;D further.<br/><br/>However, putting much/most of the required skills and knowledge in the hands of a single organizer (the GM) also dramatically <i>lowers</i> the barrier for entry for many people. All you need is one serious, committed person to organize and run games, and other people can join in with little knowledge and little commitment. This is powerful!<br/><br/>I know lots of gamers who enjoy something like D&amp;D (although I suspect they would prefer a more rules-light version, based on their lack of interest in specific rules and, often, an inability to use or remember them), but find a democratic story game to be too "difficult" in terms of demanding focus and skill.<br/><br/>The role of the GM allows one skilled and experienced person to help create a positive gaming experience for a whole group of people, as a leader, guide, and facilitator. (We've all seen groups where the GM is the only one who actually owns books and knows the rules, for instance!) A GMless game requires less from any one person but, in exchange, demands a fair bit of skill and commitment from each participant, so gathering a group which can have fun gaming together can be more of a challenge (i.e. since each participant is now more of a potential failure point for having fun at all).<br/><br/>I also agree that the "joy of roleplaying" is very opaque to a lot of people, and it's entirely possible that the appeal of such gaming is simply lost on most people. However, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d" rel="nofollow">the recent popularity of livestreamed D&amp;D</a> questions this somewhat. Perhaps RPG gaming is more accessible or widely appreciated, at least in theory, than we have been assuming? It's hard to say just yet, I think (and I'm also shocked at the people who now consume those shows passively but have no interest in actually playing!).<br/><br/>This is purely anecdotal, but in my experience D&amp;D <i>does</i> dominate the field of RPGs to the extent where most gamers (and even more so for <i>potential gamers</i>) are not aware of or haven't tried less traditional alternatives.<br/><br/>As a simple example, I recently played with a D&amp;D group. They invited me to join their campaign, and then I "guest ran" a few sessions of <i>Apocalypse World</i> for them. These were people who had played RPGs for several decades (including LARPs and other forms), and yet they had never heard of <i>Apocalypse World</i>, <i>Dungeon World</i>, <i>Fiasco</i>, or any other "major" indie titles. <br/><br/>Several design features of the game I ran for them floored them completely, like character playbooks, a smooth and fast pace of play, and dramatic focus. (Afterwards, they said, "That felt like a TV show! Wow!") <br/><br/>However, they also immediately went back to playing D&amp;D - they have a long-running campaign to continue, after all, and so much time and money invested in their particular characters, expectations for long-term play, and all the materials they've spent time and money on (books, miniatures, rules mastery, and so forth). <br/><br/>I also know many, many gamers who run and play D&amp;D not because it's their favourite game (many of them are quite vocal that it's not, in fact), but because it allows them to connect with a gaming community, find groups to play with, attract players, and share something familiar with others. <br/><br/>So, I think that there are a lot of different things at work here. <br/><br/>We've seen a number of game designs in recent times which reduce the social footprint for gaming and make it more accessible. I still don't have a game which I can reliably go to which produces traditional-RPG like fun, but there are a few out there which I think get certain elements of that right. <i>Fall of Magic</i> and <i>Fiasco</i> (both too loose/freeform, and therefore subject to social dynamics), <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> (needs a redesign in terms of mechanical procedures and better GM guidance), <i>Red Box Hack/Old School Hack</i> (has genre limitations and some GM-skill issues), and some of Vincent's prompt-based games, like <i>The King is Dead</i> all get very close. Perhaps <i>Danger Patrol</i> is another good candidate? I haven't played that one.<br/><br/>I look forward to the next generation of such games!<br/><br/>I use my own game, <i>Musette</i> a lot with gamers and non-gamers alike, and it's tremendously successful in this respect. However, it's a GMless storytelling game. It does not really create anything like a traditional RPG experience at all. It's also my experience that non-gamers, while taking to the game quickly, require a few playthroughs to really understand what's possible with the game, and don't intuitively grasp that right away. (Most people initially approach playing as a low-attention-span, goofy party game, and only later understand that the game can be more enjoyable if you actually try to make good stories with it.) This makes me wonder how many people have "tried" various roleplaying or story games and just didn't quite "get it" before they quit.<br/><br/> </div>

                            It's really hard to say. I got to chat with them about it a bit, but not enough to real dig in and get a clear sense of their preferences.<br/><br/>On one hand, I know that they love their D&amp;D game very much, and are very excited about this campaign. On the other hand, the players complain about the complexity of the rules and the frustratingly slow pace of play.<br/><br/>The GM also complains about the slow pace and about the "lack of roleplaying", unhappy that the players don't seem to take their characters seriously, as real people. He wants play to he "an immersive experience", but most table time consists of rules disputes and battle grid combat.<br/><br/>My sense is that the creative buy-in to the campaign, characters, rules, copious rulebooks and play aids, as well a short buy-in to the brand itself outweigh creative interests for them; at least at some level.<br/><br/>My impression was that they started backing out of the Apocalypse World game precisely <i>because</i> they started enjoying it so much. The more fun they had, the more they seemed concerned about it: my best guess is that they realized this was a thing they enjoyed, but were afraid that it would start to compete with the existing D&amp;D campaign, which they had committed so much to and didn't want to abandon or slow down (remember, they all already felt it was moving along way too slowly for their tastes).<br/><br/>Anyway, it's hard to say as an outsider.<br/><br/>The only relevant point of that anecdote here (from my pen, anyway) is that these were hardcore long-time gamers who were clearly entirely unfamiliar with PbtA gaming, focused character play, tightly framed drama, and "modern" game design (at least to some extent). This tells me that both the "indie" games themselves and the culture surrounding them hasn't penetrated the D&amp;D culture too deeply. I wouldn't assume that the contemporary gamer is familiar with these things - quite the contrary.<br/><br/>For non-gamers, in my experience, it's even less so; they've heard of D&amp;D and nothing else. To most non-gamers I know, D&amp;D is something they've heard of, but not necessarily "roleplaying", "tabletop gaming", "story gaming", or any other, broader concepts. When I tell them that D&amp;D is just the most popular of a whole group of related games, it's usually met with total surprise.                        </div>

Ive run D&amp;D for my kids and their friends (who loudly give an unfiltered opinion of what they like and dont like), played it myself and played D&amp;D online and neverwinter etc.. and its clear that the core of the experience is squad-based tactical combat, heavy progression mechanics, overlaid with the high fantasy heroic theme.   <br/><br/>So the main job for the GM is this situation is largely to usher the group from combat to combat and automate the combat rules on the monsters side.  This is a boring and largely thankless task - not something someone signs up for enthusiastically.  People who GM want to create worlds and plots and stories - players want to get XP and loot to progress their characters.  Its a recipe for disappointment.  Computers can do the job of a D&amp;D GM very well.  Games like neverwinter and WoW have more players than D&amp;D ever has and ever will, I think.<br/><br/>Personally, I bought Gloomhaven because it does exactly what my kids required of D&amp;D without me having to GM it, and the deck-building character progression and combat system works very well.  I still get to play with them, as a player, and its no prep.<br/><br/> </div>

Suppose someone is living in a big house, and griping about how much cleaning there is to do.<br/><br/>Maybe they would be happier in a smaller house, or even a flat - less cleaning, cheaper, and so on, and they just have never thought about it. But maybe they enjoy what they have, but the cleaning is the least enjoyable part for them. Their hobbies might require a lot of space, or maybe the status of owning a large house is important to them.<br/><br/>This might be cultural, but there seems to often be a socially expected thing to grip about for many activities. "Not enough roleplaying" seems to be, at least in some parts of roleplaying, the expected thing to gripe about when it comes to one's gaming group as a GM. I remember there being two pretty popular webcomics about this back when blogging was a new and exciting thing (based on Lord of the rings and Star wars).<br/><br/>For any given group, it might be a real issue, a minor point where improvement by slight adjustments would be welcome, or just a thing to gripe about with no consequence.                        </div>

                            That's an interesting view, Thanuir.<br/><br/>I'd agree in principle, but I don't think that was the case here. At least from the GM's side, there was a lot of frustration and constant attempts to "enforce" the desired dynamic through different fixes, incentives, and penalties. (E.g. "Ok, we're still not getting what we want, so this week I'm instituting a 100 XP penalty for anyone who addresses an NPC out of character.")<br/><br/>What's interesting, though, is that this plays into the question of this thread. <br/><br/>The reason these gripes I described weren't getting fixed weren't just consequences of the rules and procedures being used (e.g. the slow pace being exacerbated by complex rules, unnecessary battle grid combat, and an inability to "skip ahead", ever), but had a great deal to do with the GM-player dynamic.<br/><br/>In other words, the players had no interest in fixing the problems which were annoying the GM - "More role playing? We're already bored at crawling along here and just trying to keep the rules straight in our heads!" - and the GM, similarly, had no interest or incentive to address the players' gripes.

Those were fantastic; both a form of satire about who traditional campaigns can go off the rails - one was describing immature or silly players "ruining" the GM's plot, and the other about an overbearing railroading GM. Two extremes of a familiar spectrum. (Which only appears in traditional-style gaming, in my experience.)<br/><br/>None of this is to say that their gaming would be BETTER with a modern game or GMless play (though none of these particular problems came up in the Apocalypse World game which I ran!), but it would certainly be very, very different. <br/> </div>

This is in line with my experience 100%;  I don't see any basis for the idea that any sort of meaningful segment of the gaming population has been exposed to most of the ideas that have taken root in the indie game space.   Most people are doing what people do: Playing what they are familiar with.  With most groups, it's a huge battle to get any sort of buy in on actually PLAYING a different game than whatever they are used to.  They might not even think the game they are used to is especially great, but it's what they are used to, and they 'like' what they are used to.  This is further complicated by D&amp;D setting the expectation that learning a new game involves hundreds of pages of rules.<br/><br/>I just can't reconcile this behavior (which, frankly, seems like normal human nature to me. Most people are super wary of new food too) with the idea that a substantial proportion of existing roleplayers have been exposed to the ideas coming out of the indie space.<br/><br/>Also, yes, we need a new audience. Because the audience we have is being "gatekept" by D&amp;D.  If you go into roleplaying expecting something that isn't a huge pile of numbers and a tactical battle game with  a strong emphasis on power progression, you're probably going to be deeply disappointed, because the odds are overwhelmingly in favor of you starting with D&amp;D, and rather in favor of you starting with D&amp;D and a group of people who don't know anything else, so you have your first experience, decide the hobby isn't for you, and leave.  <br/><br/>How do you get around this?  I don't know.  If I did, I'd be a fabulously successful (hah) RPG marketer.  But not knowing how to fix a problem doesn't mean it's not a problem.                        </div>

                            (I've updated my post, above, with links to the webcomics. They're very clever and entertaining - and, in a way which satire often manages, actually do show some typical "trad play" dynamics, albeit in exaggerated form. The way Jar Jar Binks is explained, for instance, is brilliant and instantly relatable.)                        </div>
