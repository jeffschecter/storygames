Marketing is a tricky business, for sure. It's all about building connections to members of the community.<br/><br/>So, that being said: my advice is to put (in your signature) a line that has a link to your site, along with a mention that you're looking for reviewers for your game, and will give out free copies. Then become active in the community. Marketing requires an investment of your time and effort, and you don't get attention by going out to a random forum and starting a thread about your game. (Or, rather, you <i>do</i> get attention, but the wrong type. You look spammy, generally.)<br/><br/>If you've got a line in your sig about the game you've made, and you consistently give positive, strong contributions to the forum, you'll get your name around--and the game as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422645/#Comment_422645" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T11:29:05+00:00" title="October  9, 2013 11:29AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I miss a like or thank functionality here.

If it's a map, stock art, paper minis, or something I just can't imagine how I would use it given my typical gaming group and its needs, I don't download it. <br/><br/>These categories can shift. For example, I used to download OSRIC and Castles &amp; Crusades stuff, and even some OSR stuff when that started taking off. I don't now, because I can't figure out how to tell you if it's good or not because I don't have a clear idea of the goals of most OSR games and can't do a good evaluation for people who are after that. (Stars Without Number was the first exception to this in a long time.) I used to NOT download Shadowrun stuff because I was out of touch with it after rejecting it in my teenaged years. Recently I reconnected with it and it is now off my 'do not download' list. If we get a 4eD&amp;D game going at some point I imagine maps and minis may move into a situation where I would feel like I could review it because we're working with them more extensively. Basically I want to review things that I feel I have some relatively recent expertise in.<br/><br/>I look at your product page too: if you have major misspellings or a godawful description of the product ("for gamers, by gamers!"), or have copy/paste disabled or something that shows me you're not really aiming for being the best on the site, I don't download it unless you're new and I want to give you a chance. <br/><br/>A solid 60-70 percent of dtrpg products sent to me as a feature reviewer fall into one of these 'ain't even going to look' categories. Pathfinder feat collections, lists of 100 things, card games, OSR stuff, Battletech stuff...it's not that it's bad, it's that I'm not the right guy to tell you "yes this is good".<br/><br/>Next, I download it and give it a once over. If there are glaring problems that make it so that I would give it a 1-2 star review, it is drivethru policy that featured reviewers don't post such reviews. This is because they are supposed to be curating the products that are "solid to amazing". They even deleted my old 1-2 star reviews when I became a featured reviewer even though some of them were hilarious, trust me. But again, the purpose is not "these are trusted people and they will review everything on the site to tell you what sucks and what's great", it's instead "here's what this collection of people think the best stuff, and next-to-best stuff, on the site is."<br/><br/>If your product is graphics-intensive and when I hit 'page down' the PDF takes too long to comfortably load/read, or if it really requires cards to be printed out/manipulated to really get the experience, then I don't review it. It isn't fair to project my technical inadequacies onto your product.<br/><br/>If your product seems solid but unremarkable, I don't review it. A 3-star review saying 'yep it pretty much does what it says' is boring to write and read, and it's of questionable benefit to the publisher/creator. <br/><br/>If your product ends up being too technical for a game that I don't have sufficient expertise in to evaluate it, I don't review it. Some D&amp;D3/Pathfinder mass combat rules that I've downloaded fell into this category. I just have no idea if they're good, so I don't review it.<br/><br/>If for whatever reason I decide not to review something I downloaded, I delete it. Featured reviewers are not supposed to hang onto materials that we're downloading but not reviewing. <br/><br/>(Yes, it remains in our DTRPG library technically. And sometimes someone says 'dude, you missed something amazing, go back and look at this' and I am very surprised to find out what looked ordinary was awesome. But that's the only time I'll ever re-download something I passed on earlier.)<br/><br/>If your product happens to hit a topic I'm currently interested in or thinking about you may suddenly get a 5-screen long review while I ramble on about the subject and only tangentially connect it to your product. If your product is flawed but tries something really specific that I haven't seen other games/products do before, I'll go into insane detail about the unique piece of it. If for whatever reason I feel the product is significant in some way past its content (a groundbreaking game or a game that's important in the history of the hobby), I'm more likely to review it no matter where it ends up on the 3-5 star range. If your product is somehow topical (like it just got nominated for an ENnie or something) then I'll pursue reviewing it more aggressively.<br/><br/>The most unfair part of my review method is, if I'm absolutely over the moon for your product and think it's amazing, you won't see a review for months because I'll be playing your game and not writing about it, and then coming back and posting about my play experience as part of my way too long review.<br/><br/>Even despite this pickiness I do have way too many things to review still in my backlog, because, as you can tell, I tend to write way too many words about god darned everything.<br/><br/>Now, I can't speak for other featured reviewers or what they do or how they go about things. But that's how I've interpreted our instructions and most publishers have been happy with the reviews I've written so far.<br/><br/>Just thought I'd say how it looks from one featured reviewers end, where we get 20-odd products a day and do not have an editor. <br/><br/>If you are on drivethrurpg and you want me to do a featured review, perhaps with a "JD, look at what I did on page 3, don't just skim it, think about it OKAY?!?", PM me and I'll give what you've got a look-see (or a second look-see if your product fell into any of the various categories of 'do not review' that I described above.) I can't promise I'll love it but I'll at least look at the thing you wanted me to look at.<br/><br/>Don't just say "hey will you give me a review" because literally everyone is doing that constantly.  Say "here is the thing about my product that is great, go and look at it".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429300/#Comment_429300" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T02:14:41+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  2:14AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And you should update it: the last post was March 12th 2013!!!<br/><br/>You should also set up Grim Ogre community pages on FB and G+.</blockquote>\nHey there!

I really don't mind if people skip over my game, because it doesn't catch their interest. It is a niche product after all: being a small furry being, doing nice things to people and trying to save their forest. After one year of being so-so active on the forums, I've encountered other similar products. So it might not even be unique. I use to define the genre as mix of Shadowrun and Ewoks/MG. It has magic, technology, nature and the fight against ravaging corporations in it\u2026 but it also tries to be inclusive and a happy place to people.<br/><br/>Thank you for your contributions! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429301/#Comment_429301" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T03:10:21+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  3:10AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2014 3:12AM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>And you should update it: the last post was March 12th 2013!!!<br/><br/>You should also set up Grim Ogre community pages on FB and G+.</blockquote>\nHey there! I updated the blog just now. Thanks for pointing it out. Regarding the community pages: there's a G+ community for Michtim RPG, as well as a Facebook page. The page isn't really that helpful, so I might create a Facebook community as well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.grimogre.at/michtim/?p=279" rel="nofollow">Updated Michtim Blog</a><br/>Michtim Facebook Page<br/>Michtim G+ Community</blockquote>\nCool! The pc I'm currently on keeps saying 'can't display page' (my pc's problem not your web host, I'm sure) so I'll look at the blog later. Meanwhile:\n<blockquote>OTOH big purple seems to be pretty important. Mark Knight has posted his review there though. So far it nearly has received 1000 views, which is amazing IMO.</blockquote>\nTBP <i>is</i> important, but there's an annoyingly high churn, so if a comment is posted on a Monday chances are it'll be on p6 by Tuesday. Also, I don't want to harsh your buzz, but 1'000 views doesn't really mean very much unless they lead to sales. Have they done, do you think? I don't know how you would go about mapping spikes in sales onto periods when there's been a review, but there must be a programme out there somewhere that does that. Or good old slog I suppose...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
