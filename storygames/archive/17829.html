It\u2019s been a trying year: the caves took a lot of our energy without yielding much in return, and exposure to the elements took its toll. Still, there have been moments of beauty. A ship washed up on our shore, its hull lined with beautiful textiles. Ever since, we\u2019d been sleeping on persian rugs under tents of silk.<br/><br/>Our biggest problem is the headhunters. They live a couple hours walk from us. We know very little about them, save that their piercings are strange and that we\u2019d sometimes see heads mounted upon poles, in the space between our two encampments. One of our number goes missing, and later we see her head on display.<br/><br/>Weeks go by, and solutions are hotly contested. Some of the community members decide to poison a food offering, in the hopes of a swift decimation of their ranks. The plan fails, and its failure places us in an even more dangerous position. Others form a militia, and plan a midnight raid (a decision I regard with contempt). By stroke of uncanny happenstance, our midnight raiding party encounters one of theirs, and both parties lose a number of lives that night.<br/><br/>\u201cEnough with this violence,\u201d I say. I start a new project: we\u2019ll take some of our finest textiles, fashion them into bridal gowns, and send three of our fairest to their camp as a peace offering. It\u2019s not a decision made lightly, especially given the way that it lent shape to the community\u2019s burgeoning gender politics.<br/><br/>But a card is drawn that causes the project to fail. The wedding-offerings are thwarted. Others begin planning a second military endeavor, this time with explosives. I am heartbroken! We are becoming brutal and unconscionable as a people.<br/><br/>And so it\u2019s my turn again. I solemnly declare a project: some of the elders are going to scale the cliff-face, and as a demonstration of their anti-war stance, fall to their deaths. (Contempt is taken around the table, of course, but this is my final stand, my last effort to remind us of our collective values.) A die is placed on the map, over the cliffs, indicating \u201c1.\u201d It\u2019s going to take but a single week for this project to resolve.<br/><br/>The next player begins their turn. They draw a card and read from it: \u201cWinter elements leave everyone cold, tired, and miserable. Project dice are not reduced this week.\u201d The rain is so wretched that the elders delay their death protest. I feel a whole bunch of emotions about this, as a player. It suddenly feels really personal and real to me, their situation.<br/><br/>The week completes, and the next player beings their turn. Their card reads: \u201cThe Frost Shepherds arrive. The game is over.\u201d The siege is never carried out, and we never see the elders jump. Whatever tidy statements we had hoped to make, whatever final stands we had steadied ourselves for, the game had just responded: things aren\u2019t that simple, here.<br/><br/>I\u2019d known it before, but that was the moment that I really thought to myself, \u201cthis. This is a powerful game.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Quiet Year is Finished!</span></b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/13+-+1.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's yours to purchase, in three forms -<br/>The <b>PDF</b> costs $6.<br/>The <b>Print Version</b> which comes with a small book and deck of cards, PDF included, costs $25.<br/>The <b>Bag Set</b>, featured in the picture above, costs $40.<br/><br/>It's available at: <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/thequietyear/" rel="nofollow">The Quiet Year</a>.<br/><br/>Also of note is the fact that Tony Dowler helped me put together a little supplement/resource called <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Charted-Areas.pdf" rel="nofollow">Charted Areas</a>.<br/><br/>Hurray!
