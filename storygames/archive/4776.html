I spent weeks mulling it over, and the very real emotional effect it had on myself and the other players. Fun is fun, but when you actually start choking up while delivering a line like "To fight the monsters of the world sometimes you have to become a monster yourself." you know you've hit something deeper. (even when you've cribbed the line from a hardcore band)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided that I was going to run something heart-attack-serious this year as tribute. Now, in a stroke of utter irony the sequel to that game ran during the same slot. C'est la vie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I cooked up was Johann's Panzer. It was based off of a comic by Garth Ennis called Johann's Tiger. A tank commander breaks and runs from the eastern front during the last days of the war and heads west in the attempt to surrender to the Americans or the British to avoid unavoidable death or gulag.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the comic everyone but Johann ends up dead and He's captured by American troops while attempting to get them to kill him. It's a pretty grim story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided that I'd make some similar characters, start the story media in res, and let the characters drive it from there while I acted as a very reactive GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't go too heavily into the system as that's for another post. It's called the Two Die system and was initially designed by Chris Vermeers, and Jordan Block and I have been developing it for a couple of years now. It uses descriptors as stats and descriptors as negative effects like wounds and social damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this game I bolted on an psychological trauma mechanic that gave bonus points in a grief pool that, if used, could increase the pool in a number of dice that, when rolled during a "moment of introspection" are compared to a threshold. Passing the threshold means some sort of negative like depression, insomnia, suicidal impulses, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, I meant this to be grim. It didn't really turn out that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter list<br/>\nJohann, the veteran tank commander who felt himself damned by his actions in the war.<br/>\nJurgen, the big simpler loader who just wanted to go home.<br/>\nMax, the driver who was rapidly losing confidence in his considerable abilities.<br/>\nKarl, the gunner who had survivor's guilt from surviving four previous tanks and crews.<br/>\nWerner, the radioman who was a fiery Berlin intellectual prone to sulking and invective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to mention Joe Saul here. He truly drove the game. He stepped into the role of commander in and out of game, and never abused it for a second, if anything he made sure everyone got their share of spotlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey started in the midlle of a doomed holding action as smoke rounds came down and Johann decided that it was time to go. right like that without even contact with the actual enemy. It set a precedent of the crew making really good decisions. This led to the tone being lighter, but I refused to push ugliness on five people who were having such a good time getting around a bad situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a dead infantry Lt. propped up as sniper bait. A tense moment on a mined road, a firefight with the field police, and some really good explorations of the paternal nature of an intimate command structure like exists in a tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were two emotional breakdowns, one minor, that manifested as Karl biting his fingernails until they were raw and bleeding, and one more severe where Jurgen sort of shut down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end they surrendered to free French troops in the company of Ernest Hemmingway. A spur of the moment detail that amused me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, even though it didn't turn out like I'd planned (no plan survives contact with the... er... players) it was a total blast, and more importantly everyone got what they wanted out of it. I also got good reviews of the system which has motivated me greatly towards finishing the formal writing of the first draft.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also writing a short version of the rules for a few people. Let me know if you'd like a copy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
