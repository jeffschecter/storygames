Many are half-formed and untested, and I was hoping for some feedback about how to actually implement them. <br/>\n<br/>\n1) Civilsation-themed wandering monsters.<br/>\nThis is an idea I had quite a while ago, which has changed forms several times but I've finally settled on something which seems to work nicely. The idea is to populate the dungeon with some monsters that are a bit less random and fit in with their surroundings.<br/>\nEach civilisation gets its own special wandering monster table. After applying the effects of the Great Disaster, roll 1d6 for each special construction which was built. A roll of 5-6 means that a special monster lurks within the ruins - roll on the civilisation's special monster table, and place it in the ruins.<br/>\nFor particularly prolific civs, you might find that this generates a lot of wandering monsters. I suggest you stop adding monsters when you feel like you have enough - three should be plenty. Equally, if you don't have many special constructions (or the d6 rolls are against you), you might want to add one or two of these anyway, to add a spot of flavour.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an example table for the Dwarven civilisation:<br/>\n<br/>\n1d12 : Special Monster<br/>\n1 : Stone Golem. Once a faithful servant of the Dwarves, its original instructions have become corrupted over the years and it has become independent. Treat as if it were +1.<br/>\n2 : Malfunctioning Automaton. Instead of conflicting with groups of dwarves, they inspect the damage. Roll one die - on an even roll they can repair the malfunction and put it to work. On an odd roll, the damage is too great. They scrap it and instead gain one treasure.<br/>\n3 : Dire Badger. Feral descendants of the dwarves' trained digging animals. Treat as Ankheng.<br/>\n4 : Earth Elemental. Formerly enslaved, now wandering unfettered as the magic which bound it dissolves. May wander through solid rock without digging tunnels.<br/>\n5 : Piercers. These vermin are skulking animated stalactites which drop on you from above. Once cultivated by the Dwarves as a delicacy. Treat exactly as Green Slime.<br/>\n6 : Giant Crayfish. Formerly cultivated by the Dwarves as a food source. Place near water; roll again if there is no water on the map.<br/>\n7 : Iron Golem. As Stone Golem, but more dangerous - kills one additional unit of population. Nasty...<br/>\n8 : Grue. Shadowy remnants of the dark things released by the Dwarves' digging too deep. Likes dark places, so prefers to wander towards uninhabited areas.<br/>\n9 : Earth Weird. Elemental spirits said to be the unquiet spirits of Dwarf miners. Will wander toward the nearest source of gems, if any exist.<br/>\n10 : Fire Worms. Once used by Dwarves to dispose of garbage. They move toward and consume white beads, each one converting to 1 population.<br/>\n11 : Shrieking mushrooms. The Dwarves used these both as sentinels and a source of food. They do not wander. Whenever a same size or smaller group encounters them, their shrieking scares the group away instead of killing them. Move the group 1 thumb back the way it came, and add +1 to the mushroom patch. Groups larger than the shriekers will hack them to pieces and make a tasty risotto. Whether the mushrooms were destroyed or not, the shrieking attracts other monsters. Immediately move all other wandering monsters one half finger towards the source of the shrieking, whether or not they have already moved this turn.<br/>\n12 : Choose one of the above, or make up your own.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markpank" title="markpank"><img alt="markpank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/img/tn.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markpank">markpank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273997/#Comment_273997" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T07:39:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  7:39AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2) Civilisation-themed Minor Features.<br/>\nThe idea here is that you treat the random features table as having an extra column for each civilisation in the dungeon, and pick whichever feature you prefer.

The basic concepts I'm trying to get in here are as follows.<br/>\n<br/>\n* If there is no Great Wyrm on the map following setup, place one before you begin.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The kobolds start out in a central, large hearth chamber. Half the population stays here guarding the eggs and treasure, while the other half goes out doing kobold type things.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Kobold tunnels tend to radiate outwards from the hearth, not unlike veins or a spider's web.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Each turn, any kobold who isn't guarding the hearth will do something random, such as dig a new tunnel, expand an existing tunnel, connect two existing tunnels, or build a trap. Kobolds who are out working will dig themselves a small burrow at the end of the new tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\n* As soon as the kobolds hit any kind of ore or gems, they swarm. Swarming kobolds will do nothing other than mine the exposed ore until it is all gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The tunnels created by swarming are narrow and highly unstable. Any non-kobold digging here (or even just passing through) must make some sort of check to see whether it collapses upon them. This causes the afflicted group to lose one population and the route to be permanently blocked.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Kobolds are paranoid. Occasionally they will freak out and collapse a perfectly good tunnel for no obvious reason. This can cause kobold groups to get split up. If a single kobold unit is isolated in this way, it dies. If multiple kobolds are cut off in this way, they dig themselves a new hearth and form a rival civilisation - if they happen to meet the original group, they will conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Kobolds which meet up with a Great Wyrm do not get eaten; instead, they will worship it as a deity. The behaviour of enslaved kobolds changes completely - they spend their time building shrines to their new master, digging rooms to house its treasure and such. They must sacrifice treasure every turn - if they have no treasure, they must feed it population instead. Having the Wyrm onside gives them a +2 combat bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n* If the overall Kobold population reaches 10, there is a Great Collapse (the Kobolds blame the Gnomes for this, while the Gnomes laugh and blame shoddy tunnelcraft). <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving written this up now, it feels as if the Kobolds should have behaviour determined by their current status rather than the seasons. Default behaviour is to dig randomly, build traps and get paranoid. If ore is found, switch to swarming mode. If a Wyrm is found, switch to worship mode. Any thoughts on this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markpank" title="markpank"><img alt="markpank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/img/tn.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markpank">markpank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274010/#Comment_274010" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T08:50:31+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  8:50AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4) If we're having Kobolds, surely we need a Gnome Civilisation too.<br/>\n<br/>\n* To start off, make sure you have at least one cavern filled with gems.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The Gnome civilisation centres around the "Grand Geode", which is a massive gem-filled cavern. This place is deeply sacred to the gnomes, and they will never spoil its natural beauty by harvesting gems from it. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Each layer consists of two passages leading in opposite directions. As the two passages are extended, they will curve around the outside of the existing constructions. When placing new rooms and constructions, randomly determine which end of the passageway they will be built on. When the two ends of an encircling passage finally meet, draw a short passage radiating outwards from the meeting point, away from the Grand Geode. A guard room or trap is placed at the end of the passage. Start two more passages from the new trap room, which will encircle the Grand Geode and everything else that the Gnomes have built so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Gnomes breed, gather, build and mine like dwarves, but they prefer to mine gems above all else. If none are available, they will settle for gold and mithral.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Gnomes perform alchemy. This is a random roll which can increase or decrease population or treasure. Building labs adds to the roll, so there is less chance of bad things happening. Rolling too high means that Gnomish Alchemists discover the secret of turning base metals into gold! Unfortunately, there are side effects; a massive explosion wipes out the entire population and creates a massive crater. On the upside, the process creates a Gnomish Treasure. The Gnomish Age ends immediately, and the Great Disaster occurs (as if it hadn't already?)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Any group which manages to steal from the Grand Geode immediately becomes the target of a Gnomish vendetta. Each season the thief still lives, the Gnomes will do nothing but attack until one or the other is annihilated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markpank" title="markpank"><img alt="markpank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/img/tn.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markpank">markpank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274013/#Comment_274013" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T09:07:08+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  9:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the Gnomish Alchemy table...

A Dark Elf favoured by Dame Chaos. Treat as Giant Spider, but kills two population instead of one.<br/>\n2 : Abomination! A hideous, malformed hybrid of spider and elf, cursed by Dame Chaos. Shuns civilisation - prefers to wander towards abandoned areas, if possible.<br/>\n3 : Spider Swarm. Leaves a trail of webs not unlike a Giant Slug's slime trail.<br/>\n4 : Giant Spider. As the standard monster, but starts with 2 treasures.<br/>\n5 : Ghouls - cannibal undead which crawled out of the reanimation tanks. Just like skeletons, except that ghouls also multiply like green slime...<br/>\n6 : If there's one thing worse than Ghouls, it's a Wight. Treat as skeletons, but they kill two population instead of one and team up with any other undead they encounter.<br/>\n7 : Giant Scorpion. Gets +1 in conflicts, due to its armoured carapace and deadly venom.<br/>\n8 : Skeletons. Just like the standard monster, but starts with a treasure.<br/>\n9 : Brooding Exiled Dark Elf Ranger. Surprisingly common. Joins up with lawful groups instead of conflicting.<br/>\n10 : Quagorths -  descendants of the Dark Elves' slave beasts. Start somewhere near an old slave pit if possible.<br/>\n11 : Demon! Roll again on the Demons table...<br/>\n12 : Choose from the above, or create your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I had an idea for a rather more complex monster - the Death Spider.<br/>\nThis is a huge spider with the leering visage of a dark elf. The Death Spider teams up with all spider-related creatures. <br/>\nWhenever it defeats a group, the fallen are reanimated as spider-infested zombies under the Death Spider's command. <br/>\nThe Death Spider builds webs just like a Giant Spider and leaves web-trails like a Spider Swarm. It can only be slain by adventurers, and gets +1 in conflicts.<br/>\nIf there is a Dark Shrine or Great Temple of Dame Chaos on the map, the Death Spider always wanders directly towards it. If a shrine or temple is actually reached, the Death Spider is touched by Dame Chaos there, and undergoes a dark transformation. It claims the room as its lair and immediately cocoons all its minions impenetrably in silk, turning them to white beads. <br/>\nAny group encountering the Death Spider here automatically loses 1 population, which is immediately cocooned. Any survivors are driven away.<br/>\nIf the Death Spider ever collects six cocoons, it becomes an Alpha Villain with the Temple or Shrine as its inner sanctum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markpank" title="markpank"><img alt="markpank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://markpank.0sites.net/img/tn.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markpank">markpank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274437/#Comment_274437" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T05:55:17+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  5:55AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dark Elf themed minor features:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Spider Shrine<br/>\n2 - Hatchery<br/>\n3 - Gauntlet<br/>\n4 - Stalactite Towers<br/>\n5 - Shadow Gallery<br/>\n6 - Evil Purple Glow<br/>\n7 - Venom Distillery<br/>\n8 - Blade Academy<br/>\n9 - Exile's Waste<br/>\n10 - Theatre of Cruelty<br/>\n11 - Noble's Folly<br/>\n12 - Grand Ballroom<br/>\n13 - Gallery of Failed Experiments<br/>\n14 - Wizard's Retreat<br/>\n15 - Impenetrable Webs<br/>\n16 - Handmaiden<br/>\n17 - The Eightfold Eye<br/>\n18 - Iron Maiden<br/>\n19 - Broken Chains of Iron<br/>\n20 - Living Stalagmites                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
