The pitch is a boy is about to burned at a stake for practicing witchcraft and a mage guild has come to put a stop to this madness. A king who cares about himself and greed. A wizard who threatens the balance of the kingdom if he should turn rogue.<br/><br/>Character concepts change as the characters are fleshed out more and more. A knight lord, an apprentice mage and a ex-slave pickpocket are brought into the spotlight. Three fates bound to each other with only darkness approaching.
