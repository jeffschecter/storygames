I tend to describe them by genre and play style as a way for the other players to talk about the game they want to play while we choose. Naturally I don't bring any playsets I wouldn't be happy to play :-)<br/><br/>I have the playsets created as double sided laminated print outs and have a second copy of the relationships options as it's the one everyone is going to have to choose from. That way people can be looking over options while others are picking which speeds up the setup phase a bit.<br/><br/>Having the 'playmat' out with the process of play is valuable, I make sure to take some breaks but talk about the game a bit during them too.<br/><br/>Don't know if any of that will help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403661/#Comment_403661" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T09:56:53+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  9:56AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 9:57AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I've started to do in convention games lately is to skip the formal Aftermath montage and just talk it out.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403711/#Comment_403711" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T22:12:40+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 10:12PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Something I've started to do in convention games lately is to skip the formal Aftermath montage and just talk it out. </blockquote>\nCan you give us an example of this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403712/#Comment_403712" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T22:32:59+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 10:32PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 11:31PM by Graham.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More than other games, I think Fiasco requires a group of players who are on board with each other. They needn't be experienced - in fact, a bunch of new people works beautifully - but they must be willing to play off each other. When I've had a below-average Fiasco experience, it's because one player has been doing funny things (either throwing stupid stuff in or playing defensively) and everyone else needed to control him.<br/><br/>Pick an easy playset. The first time I tried to facilitate Fiasco, I let the players pick the playset. They went for the Cthulhu one, which was <i>really</i> hard, and the game didn't really work. (Never trust players, is what I'm saying.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403720/#Comment_403720" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T03:41:50+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  3:41AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Lisa, instead of contributing one die and making a statement about your character's future in sequence as per the rules, just have a group discussion where you lay out the days, months and years ahead. <br/><br/>I also agree with Graham - when you facilitate, strongly model the behavior you want to see in others. Make sure you are clear about the game's play style and your expectations. It absolutely can have all the fun sucked out of it by players who are defensive and want to win, or players who view the lack of a GM as an excuse to try to break it.<br/><br/>I always choose three playsets and let them pick from among those options, which saves you from analysis paralysis and handily omits more complicated or difficult playsets. Pick ones you like that are easy to relate to and straightforward, not the ones that are set in obscure times and places or have special rules. The Ice is a good choice because it is neutral ground, imaginatively. Any of the more mundane ones (Flyover, Main Street) are good,at least for an American table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403721/#Comment_403721" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T04:32:16+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  4:32AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The good playsets are the simple petty crime ones. Try letting them choose from from Main Street (American small town), Gangster London (London gangsters) and Boomtown (Western). All the ones in the main book are good. <br/><br/>But don't give them Alpha Complex and Unaussprechlichen Klutzen. Players might latch on to them (Paranoia! Cthulhu!), but they're not good for a first outing.<br/><br/>Here is a thing! In the first round, I suggest that people should simply focus on playing the relationship between them and another character.<br/><br/>So, if our characters are Alfie (my character), Bob, Charlie and Dan, I begin by playing the relationship with Alfie and Bob. They're father and son, so we play a scene at home. Next comes a scene about Bob and Charlie. They're former convicts, so let's see Bob meeting Charlie when he's released from prison. And so on. There's no pressure to do anything other than play the relationship.*<br/><br/>This does a few things. Firstly, it gives players who like traditional games some structure. Secondly, it defuses story gamers who want to INTRODUCE BURNING PLOT into the first scene: "Let's go and find your long-lost brother!". Thirdly, it protects against solo scenes, which require a lot of inventiveness and can fizzle easily in the first round.<br/><br/>The problem with Fiasco is that it's wide open. You can do <i>anything</i> in a scene and that can be paralysing. So it's okay to explicitly explain expectations, whether that's to D&amp;D Players, indie gamers or completely new players.<br/><br/>For example! In one game, we had a guy who had <i>never played a roleplaying game</i> before. His character was a cat burglar, whom he narrated having Spiderman-style sucker pads and a jetpack. We didn't want to say no. So he became a sort of crazy inventor figure, who genuinely had a jetpack in his van: we were never sure whether he was brilliant or a fantasist. And we explicitly explained what we were doing there: "How about if we make you a sort of crazy inventor and we're not sure whether the jetpack works or not?". He loved that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403726/#Comment_403726" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T08:27:38+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  8:27AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The american ones work well for central european players too.

But I also saw another game (one I was almost part of) go not-so-well because the players didn't quite have a sense of what they were in for; one of them remained disengaged through Act 1 and then left during the break. So, it's in your own best interest to make sure people know a little bit about what they are in for so that they can determine for themselves if the game is right for them. <br/><br/>I always work with the assumption (perhaps incorrect!) that potential new players know nothing about story games and it's my job to give them a quick briefing before they decide if they want to sit down and play the game. I might say something like this: "Fiasco is one of my favorite games, and it's something that you'd have no problem convincing me to play virtually any day of the week. But it's very different than a lot of other games, and I realize it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It's much less structured than other RPGs, and there really isn't a "win" condition like you might have in a board or card game. Have you ever seen a comedy improv show? Think of it like that, only more violent and a few dice thrown in. The game lasts between two and three hours with a short break about halfway through. It really works best if everyone participates and takes an active role in the fun. If you don't like talking, it's probably not going to be a game you'll like much. But if you are willing to commit to your character and you enjoy being entertained,  particularly by dark humor, I think you will really like this. So, if it's not your thing, no hard feelings -- there's a D&amp;D table right over there, and they'd love to have you."<br/><br/>If it sounds like that is designed to politely scare people off... well, in a way it is <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Study their body language and facial expressions to see if they are into the idea or not. If they seem like people who would really enjoy this, for God's sake, don't scare them off! But if they are just joining your table because they happened to stumble upon you and don't seem willing to be active participants, then they (and you) will probably have a more enjoyable con experience at another table.<br/><br/>And once you've found your right mix of players, I agree with everything said by everyone else, particularly about sticking with a simpler playset.<br/><br/>Have fun, and please post Actual Play reports!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403731/#Comment_403731" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T10:06:49+00:00" title="January 15, 2013 10:06AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An addendum: <br/><br/>For those at the convention "on the fence" about whether the game is right of them, be sure to share the several positives:<br/>* Easy to learn<br/>* "One and done" (does not require additional sessions to complete your story)<br/>* Character creation is quick and fun<br/>* Very newbie-friendly                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jkl620" title="jkl620"><img alt="jkl620" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jkl620">jkl620</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403848/#Comment_403848" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-16T19:51:40+00:00" title="January 16, 2013  7:51PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the ideas everyone, very helpful suggestions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404151/#Comment_404151" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T15:22:06+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  3:22PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two other things I have found: Constrain choices in the setup: Go around and do relationships first, then go to location/object/need, and decide in advance which extras you'll lay down for extra players.
