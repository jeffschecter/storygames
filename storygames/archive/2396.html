                    In my first playtest of PEQ, which I wrote about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22918.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I mentioned that the number one snag was what to do. I wrote in that post:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Snag number one occurred in Infiltration &amp; Engagement and On the Roof with the Rogue player: What to do? Where to go? We ran into problems on where things were going. All the players were unfamiliar with the genre of this game, so they didnâ€™t know that sneaking around, meeting informants, planting explosives, etcâ€¦ are all cool things that Special Forces do on missions. Ideally, I think that a general outline of what must happen on each Threat Level would go a long way to solving this. The solutions that occur to me are: 1. Random situation creation tables, 2. A little pre-game planning by the GM, or 3. During Recon, each Threat Level is reconnoitered and decided on by the players. With failed rolls, the GM makes it up or uses random situations creation tables.</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
These are the new rules for Recon, which I hope will help eliminate the problems:<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Recon<br/>
<br/>
The first step of play is recon.  This is where the players run reconnaissance, study satellite and aerial photos to determine the base layout, terrain features, enemy locations, where the base is located and any other information that may be useful during Insertion and Infiltration &amp; Engagement.<br/>
The GM should provide satellite or aerial photos of a military base or a location that looks like a military base in this stage of the game. Samples are included for quick pick-up play. Alternatively, the players can draw a map during this stage.<br/>
Using the map, players can run recon on the individual features on the map and develop an attack plan on the facility. This is the Operativeâ€™s home base, so they should be familiar with the functions of the buildings, but they are reconnoitering the terrorist emplacements and the GM should make sure to remind the players of this. On a successful recon roll, the player determines what has been reconnoitered in that location. They should describe the feature. When a recon roll fails, that location can no longer be reconnoitered and the GM can either decide what is in that location now or later. The reconnoitering ends when the players have successfully or not reconnoitered six locations. The GM places Threat Level seven onto the map.<br/>
To develop an attack plan, the players should determine what they plan to do, when they want to move into reconnoitered location, and even what they intend to accomplish in each location. The next step is to label the steps of the plan on the map. These steps of action should correspond closely to the Threat Levels the players want to be at when they move into a new location. During play, everything may not go according to plan and the players may find that they have to have their Operatives improvise. Sometimes, the mission wonâ€™t move as quickly as they hoped, and sometimes, the team will be at Threat Level Two when they hit the ground. The players can decide which parts of their plans they can skip or what they need to add to make their plan work.<br/>
Each player may gain one Threat Level during recon.<br/>
<br/>
<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Area_51_28_August_1968_6.jpg" rel="nofollow">EXAMPLE MAP HERE</a><br/>
<br/>
For example, on the shown map of the Groom Lake Facility (Area 51), the players have decided that their Operators will insert to the west of the main groups of buildings where they have determined an outpost of terrorist guards have set up a monitoring station. This will be location one. Here the Operatives will disable the main alarm connections to the main set of buildings. After, disabling the security, they will head down the hill into a secure location to set up a SATCOM and computer uplink system that will allow them to remain in contact with their ODB via their TACcom Radio<br/>
systems (Threat Level 2). After the SATCOM is set up, they will stealthy move into the main set of building, split into two in order to take out both of the Bradley M6 Linebackers at the perimeter of the base. This will be a fall back plan for the team. If they fail, it will allow unhindered air strikes on the base (Threat Level 3). After the team destroys the M6s, they will move into a location that they were unable to get any info on (Threat Level 4). They will either regroup here, or in the hanger facility, which is at Threat Level Five. Here is the back-up security system for the base. They plan to utilize the security system to find the terrorists and gain a current view of the enemy situation. After gaining new knowledge, theyâ€™ll move into locations to attack the main terrorist hold-out in an attempt to gain advantageous locations in the sewer system and from above (Threat Level 6).</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
So, how about it? Using these rules could you come up with an attack plan for a raid on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Area_51_28_August_1968_6.jpg" rel="nofollow">Groom Lake</a>. To reconnoiter each of the six locations roll a 4 or under. It would be helpful to see what you come up with. If you can't what more do you need to make this work?                </div>

                            I'm finding this extraordinarily hard. What do I do again? I decide on a location, then roll a dice, and that decides whether I know what's there? And then I do an attack plan? Could you take me through it slowly?<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></div>

                            The prose is a bit dense, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
I guess the way that I'm imagining it is like this:<br/>
<br/>
-The GM hands the players a map with a base on it.<br/>
-The players then decide which locations look cool, and roll their recon skill to see if they successfully reconnoiter each location. (Maybe, the GM needs to circle six locations.)
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
If successful, the player gets to describe what challenge in that location needs to be overcome.
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
If the player fails the roll, then the GM decides and keeps it secret.<br/>
-After that, the players label the locations 1 to 6, which will correspond to the Threat Level of the game.<br/>
<br/>
So, like this:<br/>
<br/>
GM: Your ODB commander leans over the desk and looks you in the eyes and say, "I can't make anything out of this terrorist deployment. All I know is that they are holding the hostages here and the suitcase nuke is likely to be there also." He points at Threat Level Seven on the map.<br/>
P1: "Well, the perimeter might be a problem depending on if the terrorists modified our systems. I'm going to roll to see what's going on with our fence system." Rolls successfully "It looks like they managed to override the safety protocols and they've activated the electric fence system."<br/>
P2: "That means that they're probably into the computer system, so we'll need to check the IT building." P2 points at a building on the map. Roll fails. "Crap, the intel just isn't good enough for us to know what's going on in there."<br/>
P3: Points at the runway with a C-130 cargo plane parked on it. "That plane is awfully close to the terrorists hold out. If it's flyable, then they have a way out unless we destroy it." Rolls successfully. "Just as I expected. We're going to have to blow that plane up before they can move the nuke and hostages."<br/>
...and on until all six locations have been reconnoitered...<br/>
GM: Okay. The commander says, "What's your action plan?"<br/>
P2: "Well, we have to take out the fence system first to gain access to the main ground, so that'll be Threat Level one."<br/>
P3: "And that plane needs to be taken out ASAP, so let's make that Threat Level two."<br/>
P1: "I don't want to get ambushed too late in the game, so lets move into the IT building and see what's going on in there. So, that will be Threat Level three."<br/>
<br/>
Am I idealizing this too much for actual play? Maybe the map needs to be less detailed than the Groom Lake map and have the building labeled?                        </div>

                            To be honest, I'm having trouble being inspired by the map. It all just looks like buildings.<br><br>Let me try. So let's say those six things near the bottom are fuel tanks. I fail my roll, so I don't know anything about them.<br><br>The large dark rectangular building, just up from there, is a garage. Another failed roll.<br><br>Um, four white buildings in a row, just to the left of the garage, are storage things. Roll succeeds, so let's say we've seen them shipping crates of Russian arms in and out of those buildings.<br><br>Lots of little buildings, they're barracks. Another failed roll! Man.<br><br>One of the funny buildings to the right of the barracks is the generator. Roll succeeds: it's a diesel-driven generator, supplied by a bloody great tanker.<br><br>Three rectangular buildings near the top: they're some big secure storage buildings. Another success: that's where the hostages are held. It's guarded with motion sensors and snipers.<br><br>So action plan is: move in from the bottom, sabotage the fuel tanks (1), then the vehicles (2) and the arms (3), search the barracks (4), take down the generator (5) and finally storm the building (6).<br><br>Is that what you expected? I'm finding it hard to do: to me, everything just looks like a building, so I have to keep thinking of different sorts of buildings. And the map is so small-scale it doesn't really spark my imagination.<br><br>By the way, it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/Recruitment4.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!</a>: the two games aren't a million miles away from each other. <br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Thanks for the help, Graham. That's close to what I'm trying to get at. I'm trying to get at a plan that can generate the situation and challenges instead of a random system. <br><br>Is it just that map? Do these maps do anything else for you (Balad Air Force Base, Iraq. It's just north of Baghdad)? Do you think it would help to have the buildings labeled? So, like in the first one, the white building at the bottom would be Aircraft Hanger. The buildings in the top left Administration. The buildings inside the concrete walls: Officers Command Post. <br><br>Both pictures can click through to larger images. It's pretty cool to see the helicopters on the second one.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41226415@N00/389925160/" rel="nofollow" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="balad-angle" height="363" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/389925160_0327bc71ca.jpg" width="500"/></a><br><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41226415@N00/389925159/" rel="nofollow" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="balad3 copy" height="310" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/389925159_de60a55b46.jpg" width="500"/></a><br><br>Thanks, Graham.

                            Hey Bryan,<br><br>Your hypothetical example of play sounds pretty cool to me. But I'm into that kind of color already. Maybe that's just a requirement for playing PEQ? And Graham's example (even though he said he wasn't that inspired) was still pretty good. I think this method is definitely worth playtesting.<br/><br/>The second set of maps are way better.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'm going to give it a go in the next playtest, but with a little change: Each player is trying to succeed at recon, so he will be able to gear the challenge in that Threat Level towards his skill set. In other words, each Threat Level can be geared to a specific character specialty -- a good reason to stay a team until the last moment.<br/><br/>I agree, the second set of maps are way better. They're from Google Earth, and they couldn't be used in the final version of the game, but a hand drawn simplified map will work better for the game, I think.                        </div>
