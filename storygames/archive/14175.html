What games have interesting systems for adjudicating that?</p>\n<p>I'm thinking, for example, of <em>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</em>, where there are a number of scenes for each of a fixed number of Events, which take place over the course of a semester. So, this system links scene-framing to passage of time in the world of the narrative.</p>\n<p>Another, much less interesting example, is "one round takes 3 seconds", and all the variations on that. I am particularly interested in macro-level time systems.</p>\n<p>(I ask particularly because I'm working on a game set in the Regency era. I want to make a system to encourage time passing at a period-appropriate rate, which I think <em>The Roach</em> does very well, but I want something more open-ended. I'm brainstorming currently, and wondered if anyone here had input or interest in the subject.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321686/#Comment_321686" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T04:47:14+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  4:47AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Advancing time could be a mechanical reward or penalty.

I need to play it to confirm it is in fact as awesome as it feels upon reading, but the entire game is a system for roleplaying the passage of time, albeit mostly over entire Eras of history (rather than say days/weeks/months, although you could probably play it that way with no modification).<br/><br/>There's nothing like "time countdown dice" or anything, but the entire structured layout of cards (which represent eras and later scenes) is laser-focused on capital-T Time.<br/><br/>I avoided looking into Microscope because I've kinda immunized myself to waves of intense explosive hype (not "bad hype: Hype that exists to promote something not worth promoting", but you know what I mean; "Everyone talking about something Big a lot for a week before moving on to the next thing), but eventually got it based on the awesomeness of the author and its premise. Again, I need to play it (and will soon), but it's quite inspiring, a real gem of system and execution (in explaining the rules), and it can do what you're looking at...<br/><br/>...however, not in a passage where you go chronologically from period to period. You might start in the Middle, play out the End, then see the Beginning, etc. That bit might not work for you, and trying to use Microscope to shoehorn it that way would be kinda playing the game not as intended.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321694/#Comment_321694" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T07:29:52+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  7:29AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I liked about Houses of the Blooded is that when you meet for a traditional session, that's the one thing your characters can afford to do for that season.  Other than that, they manage their lands and play politics and tacticians.  So time marches steadily on to the backdrop of a turn based strategy game, punctuated by role-play.<br/><br/>Ganakagok has one of the coolest pacing mechanisms ever.  You exist in a culture that has never seen the sun, living under starlight forever.  As the game progresses, mechanically, through the moves the players make, stars dissapear from the sky, as their light is overcome by the inevitable first dawn (which ends the game).<br/><br/>Puppetland enforces time passing in a different way.  You only get an hour in real time to play a session.  Period.  So you may narrate that the puppets spend three days climbing the wintery mountainside in search of the hut of the long forgotten sage of the icicle cliffs, but if you start playing at 3:27, the puppets will go to sleep at 4:27 no matter what they have accomplished in the fiction.  That session is over.<br/><br/>Many games have travel times, and then place interesting locations far apart from one another, but that seems to irritate players more than anything else.<br/><br/>I have noticed that often, when you give the players the ability to advance the clock, they will.  In Zombie Cinema or or Kagematsu for instance, once players understand that they can move the clock up as far as they want to suit their purpose, people will frame a scene that happens weeks, even years after the previous one because of the power that has on the narrative.  Those are short-term games, though, not meant to be played for more than a session.<br/><br/>I hope some of this helps?  Maybe?  I can never tell, and I'm prone to ramble....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321700/#Comment_321700" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-25T08:34:59+00:00" title="April 25, 2011  8:34AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also the potential for real-time resolution.

Setting it to different values can make drastically different games - a yearly harvest cycles, or a monthly business cycle, for example.<br/><br/>I'm imagning each of those timelines, or cycles, ticks at different rates.
