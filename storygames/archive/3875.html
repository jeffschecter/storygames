I had this idea for a way that a player could play in an RPG, and the idea was this:  Maybe that player would NOT play the role of any speaking character whatsoever.  Instead, they would be in complete and uncontested control of describing anything and everything inanimate, non-sentient, etc.  The hallways, the sky, the books, the cows, the freshmen.  Things without any personality or self-awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving had the idea, I expanded upon it and then last night I played it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor ways to draw cards, I chose the "Spooky" Mood:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">DRAW A CARD WHEN YOU DESCRIBE:<br/>\n- Noises of unknown origin<br/>\n- Inadequate lighting<br/>\n- Overly elaborate growth or construction</div>\n</blockquote>\n... and the "Mystery" genre ...\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">DRAW A CARD WHEN YOU INTRODUCE:<br/>\n- The truth, obviously concealed<br/>\n- A new truth that seemingly contradicts an old one<br/>\n- One of these things just doesn't belong</div>\n</blockquote>\nNow I'll freely admit that I <i>missed</i> playing NPCs (Sydney played most of them, with Jen and Eric having occasional rights if their character wasn't in the scene).  I felt like my hands were tied behind my back ...  I really could have pushed the "Mystery" angle much harder with just a LITTLE time handling some NPCs ... urrrghh!<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT ....<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, I found myself <i>really</i> excited by the focus on describing the scenery.  Really, really, excited.  Like, unholy glee.  I knew in advance that there was some fun to be had there, but once I started doing <i><b>only</b></i> that thing, I suddenly realized what a huge and spectacular gold-mine of fun is to be had there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with my control over the inanimate, I also got to tell people where each scene was set.  So Eric decided that the three students were studying together for a trigonometry test coming up.  I then set the scene in the crypt library of the school, and dwelt upon the 40 watt bulbs danging on extension cords from the ceiling (inadequate lighting, take a card!) and the vaulting columns with roccocco patterns carved into them (overly elaborate constructiion, take a card!) in which books were jammed seemingly at random.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey eventually went looking for some sort of trig quick-guide, and I switched over to setting the Mystery.  Amidst the heavy books was wedged a trapper-keeper folder (one of these things just doesn't belong, take a card!).  It was filled with notes, but of obviously different eras ... some of them were on yellowed paper, some much newer.  Each of them had a place marked off on the paper for a name, and on each page someone had blacked out the name with a big, solid block of sharpie-ink (the truth, obviously concealed, take a card).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm sitting here telling people this, and they're like ... "Uh ... damn.  That's creepy.  Is there any way we can see what the name was?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd naturally I say "Well, it looks like if you looked at the paper against a really bright light you might be able to read it, but it's so <i>dim</i> down here."  And I take a card.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt.  Was.  So.  Easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite moment:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Jen is describing something (in her temporary role as school nurse) and she says to Eric "Okay, Ms. Mercury sits Aidan down at her desk ... 'You just stay here a moment, and ... ' "<br/>\n<br/>\n"What does the desk look like?" Eric asks Jen.<br/>\n<br/>\n"It's a plain metal ... whoops!" Jen replies, "Not my job, I forgot.  Tony, what does the desk look like?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oooh!" I say, suddenly coming on point.  "Hrm ... it's a heavy, metal-frame desk, but instead of the clean lines of the 1950s, this is all carved pewter-work with some sort of wierd, damscened linoleum for the top.  There are big heavy drawers and each of them has a great big skull carving with cadeuceus snakes twining around it for both handle and keyhole.  Oh, and in the corner of the desk-top, someone years ago clearly used a pencil to meticulously carve 'J.K. + R. R.' with a big black heart around it."</div>\n</blockquote>\nI can't remember the last time I spouted descriptions like that.  It's not that I don't enjoy it, it's just ... with Flags and Bangs and R-Maps and playing the NPCs and challenging the PCs and balancing this that and the other thing, who has time to think about graffitti on a school desk?<br/>\n<br/>\nI did feel like I got more traction from the Mood than I did from the Genre.  Following the formula for the mood very quickly ... well, set the mood.  Following the formula for the genre really required a <i>reason</i> to get the players pushing against that pattern, trying to solve the mystery.  Not quite sure what to do about that ... if I had NPCs I could have pushed, but if I had NPCs then I'd have more stuff competing for my attention :-(  Maybe the keys on the genre just aren't written correctly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87044/#Comment_87044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T13:21:28+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  1:21PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realize this is not your intention here, but what would be the possibility of using this method to formalize scene setting for a GM?
