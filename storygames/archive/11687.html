Boo. Hiss. If you've run a trad game recently, and you tried it without prep, how did it go? Any pointers? Here's what I learned...<br/><br/><b>How did it go?</b><br/>Mostly okay. Started off making characters. Hooked them up nicely, plopped them into an interesting starting point\u2026 (One fellow had just beaten and robbed a con artist only to find a Dwarf suspended from a tree in a sack).<br/><br/><b>What would you have done better?</b><br/>I didn't play the NPCs very well. They had no barbs. By trying to paint the world, I forgot about painting the game. Characters that are introduced on the fly are like brush-strokes, colourful and intentional. It's important to give greater importance to the latter. That is, what can I <em>do</em> with this character?<br/><br/>More problematically, I curbed player interaction, for example, the rain thing. One of the players asked me if it was raining. I said no. Very. Bad. Form. Do you know why? Leave a comment if you do.<br/><br/><b>Favourite bits?</b><br/>From my point of view, I particularly liked playing Penny, the pregnant mother who wouldn't be escorted to the church (fearing for her baby). She had intentions beyond herself which contrasted with the short term goals of the PCs. She was the only character that mattered, and that was because she could cause problems.<br/><br/>I also liked the character creation, and my part in it: Finding out what made the characters tick, asking probing questions, putting players on the spot, enjoying the feedback.<br/><br/><b>What about the trad style made it bad?</b><br/>When I said zero-prep, I lied. I spent a few minutes devising a tiny plot for the players after we'd generated characters. But instead of hooking them into it, it just hooked me. By trying to create an interesting story vector which the PCs could steer and alter, I narrowed the bandwidth of creativity, and not in a good way, and only for me. That is, I had an expectation of what would happen and rather than let something novel blossom, I kept regressing to that expectation.<br/><br/>Plus, the zero to hero style of the game rules meant that the PCs couldn't succeed at <em>anything</em>. It was a lesson in emasculation.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Notes for next time (in the second person for instructive effect):</b></span><br/><br/><b>Peel the story.</b><br/>Start in the middle of the action and let the meeting point of the story tell itself. It's not always interesting to detail character intersection. But it is always interesting to see how new characters cope under stress.<br/><br/>For example, in our game what if I started the session with a night-time chase through the woods? What if the player characters are being chased by a mob? And they reach a palisaded hamlet? <em> </em>How do they escape the mob? Why are they being chased? Why are they together? These things can be worked out on the fly.<br/><br/><b>Players set scenes.</b><br/>You don't know what the players want. So ask them. Where are you now? What time is it? What are you trying to achieve? Who is there? This is all fairly standard stuff if you're used to indie gaming, but it's easy to forget when you break out your (proverbial) GM's screen.<br/><br/><b>Dangle carrots.</b><br/>Now you know <em>what </em>they want, drop in the <em>who</em>. If one player sets the scene in a tavern, and he's looking for <em>glory</em>, it's time to drop in the <em>wealthy, handsome, wench laden adventurer</em>. If another player sets the scene in a market square and he's looking for <em>riches</em>, drop in a <em>fancy looking agent with an enormous to-do list</em>. Provide!<br/><br/><b>Antagonise.</b><br/>He giveth and he taketh away. Whatever the player wants, they gotta earn it. It's the "<em>Not soooo fast!</em>" rule of thumb. Either the player gets it the hard way (=consequence) or he gets it easy but has to make a difficult choice (=consequence).<br/><br/><b>Time out.</b><br/>And every hour and a half ask for a time out so you can piece some of the characters together. Maybe this sailor knows that wagon driver? Wouldn't that be interesting! Could the wagon driver be a spy? What happens if that thug wants to betray the barman? Etcetera.<br/><br/><strong>If you've run some indie games, nothing here will be new.</strong> If you're like me, though, you may have forgotten to burn your old uniform before you visited the old school.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260644/#Comment_260644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T06:47:05+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  6:47AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are  number of "Trad" (ugh, pthui, that <b>word</b>) that are meant to be run with just the tiniest sliver of prep.

If the players can't even expect the GM to come up with the most minor of details about what the hell is going on, it's bound to create problems with direction and momentum.  If the player said "can it be raining?  I've got this thing I wanna do in the rain . . ." <i>that's</i> when you'd wanna say "Sure!"\n<blockquote>Players set scenes.<br/>You don't know what the players want. So ask them. Where are you now?

You:  "Where are you now?"  Player:  "Strapping on the full plate armor, magical sword, and Hochland Long Rifle that I just looted from the bandits I killed . . .  you know . . . on the road."  The economy system in this type of game is a big part of the "carrot" that incentivizes player actions.  Giving the players high levels of authorial control is going to muck with that.  "What do you want to do?" offers similar interest-based freedom, but doesn't threaten the underlying meta-game as much.  <br/><br/>I don't know, it feels to me like you're dealing with a lot of indie/trad identity politics ("am I playing 'indie' enough?").  Just relax.  You don't have to turn a hoary classic into a cutting edge hipster story poem thing.  It's better to play to your system's strengths.  In this case the system's strength is "oh-shit-we-can't-hit-anything-gritty-fantasy/horror"<br/><br/>edit:  HTML clean-up and a couple of sentence fixes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260751/#Comment_260751" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T13:21:29+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  1:21PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I've run WFRP I've found character and situation to be the king: story concerns have no place in play.

I've got this thing I wanna do in the rain . . ." that's when you'd wanna say "Sure!"</blockquote> Yes, you're right. I retract the "scene setting" requirement.<blockquote>The economy system in this type of game is a big part of the "carrot" that incentivizes player actions.</blockquote>Interesting. This was never an important issue in my games, even in the old days. Games were always about gaining respect, doing the right thing, and getting blamed for crimes you didn't commit. So I don't think it would be so problematic to my table.\n<blockquote>When I've run WFRP I've found character and situation to be the king: story concerns have no place in play.

Prepared narrative has no place.<br/><br/>Also, John, if the Action -&gt; Consequences rule is the only tool I bury in my head after this, I'll have done myself a kindness.
