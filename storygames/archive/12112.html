I didn't love it -- some parts bugged me more than others -- but mainly, yep, good movie.<br/><br/>In the broadest sense, I'm not sure I really agree with the underlying premise of the movie:  People can't have kids and they FREAK THE HELL OUT.  I mean, yeah, it's the conceit of the movie, so I'm going to just give it to them.  But in my heart, I don't think it would play out like that.<br/><br/>I think it would play out like this:  PARRRR-TAAYYYY!  There's no rainy day futures to save up for, so let's screw the planet as hard and fast as we can before we burn out.  Let's dine upon condor eggs while we nuke Everest just for the view.  But that's just my take on it.<br/><br/>I liked the way the government was portrayed.  I feel like they started off with a question:  What would it take to make a crazy militarized hardcore government response justified?  How about the end of the world and everyone freaking the hell out?  Yeah, that works for me.<br/><br/>I kinda wonder what the movie would be like if it was set farther out in the timeline.  Like, what if the youngest known person was 50, and most of the population in their 70s?  It's not the movie they made, and I'm okay with that, but still I wonder.<br/><br/>The only part I really especially didn't like was the really cliche apocalyptic thing of, alright guys, here we are just driving down a country road in the middle of nowhere, and then suddenly HOLY CRAP all these pissed-off guys are just jumping out of the trees and attacking us for some reason.  I mean, what are they doing out there?  Having a picnic?  Why are they so pissed off for some reason?  What the heck is their deal?  And what are they going to do after the car drives off?  Go back to their picnic?<br/><br/>Is there ever a time when beating the hell out of someone with a car battery is not awesome?  I do not believe so.<br/><br/>As far as stealing lessons for RPGs from it, I think there's some to be had here.  It does a good job of telling the most interesting story that exists in the fiction.  It does a fine job of keeping NPCs as NPCs (by which I mean: the payload of the Escort Mission of the movie is just cargo.)  It handles a basic Mission structure (or Quest, if that's better) without feeling too terribly railroady.<br/><br/><br/>What does everyone else think of it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271200/#Comment_271200" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T14:49:29+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  2:49PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The extended scene where the government goons assault the housing estate was harrowing.

So in that respect, I think they <i>did</i> address at least some of the "PARRRR-TAAYYYY!" reaction.<br/><br/>Also:<blockquote>The only part I really especially didn't like was the really cliche apocalyptic thing of, alright guys, here we are just driving down a country road in the middle of nowhere, and then suddenly HOLY CRAP all these pissed-off guys are just jumping out of the trees and attacking us for some reason.

And all you and your buddies want to do is PARRRR-TAAYYYY, you want to fuckin' break some shit, because why the fuck not?  It doesn't matter what you do, there's no tomorrow for the human race, so we should all be doin' it in the streets and burning plastic and whatever else we want to do, but The Man says, "No, you can't do that, we're in charge, you will be good citizens and obey the laws."  And if you try to do your crazy end-of-the-world antics in the middle of London, they're going to put a stop to it.<br/><br/>But the flip side of that is that they're so busy trying to keep the cities from becoming an anarchic stew of craziness and apocalyptic terror, they can't possibly stop you from hanging out in the forest with your pals and going apeshit on anyone and anything that passes through.  Plus, anyone without papers, anyone who'd be dead meat if the authorities got a hold of them...well, they're probably willing to join you out there, and have a vested interest in making sure that the rule of law and common decency don't ever extend out that far.<br/><br/><br/>Or at least, that's what I was getting out of that.  The movie just happened to focus on the hopeless despair of it all, because, well, ENGLAND.  I'm sure that in Dubai or Las Vegas, it was all mountains of cocaine and piles of underage hookers and setting polar bears on fire just to light their cigars.  But that's a different movie, and probably wouldn't be all that interesting to watch, even if it was NC-17.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271291/#Comment_271291" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T19:52:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  7:52PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The joy of Children of Men is the beautiful direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271295/#Comment_271295" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T20:32:46+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  8:32PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The extended scene where the government goons assault the housing estate was harrowing.

The acting is excellent, too: not because you look at any actor and think "That's really good acting", but because you don't do that. It's seamless and naturalistic. It feels as though you're watching real people.<br/><br/>The satirical element is good, too. It's heavily influenced by British attitudes to immigration and post-9/11 security measures. It's beautifully done, especially since the original book was written in the 1990s.<br/><br/>It feels like a very British postapocalyptic film, closer to <i>28 Days Later</i> and <i>The Day of the Triffids</i> than, say, <i>I Am Legend</i>. It's all grimy and despairing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I was literally too busy finishing writing to go to a movie at the time. So it's only in the mediography of 1.1 and later. If I were to put it in Shock: terms, the Issues are Reproductive Rights and Immigration, while the Shock is obviously "The impending end of humanity". Praxes are Cowering vs. Running and For Me vs. For You. Theo's the Protag and his Antag is ... shit, there are a lot of them. It probably starts with Julian, then spreads out to the various factions. Links are to Julian and Jasper. In the end, Jasper is replaced by Kee.</p>\n<p>... it just occurred to me how similar the ending is to The Graduate's.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271405/#Comment_271405" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T10:42:54+00:00" title="May 15, 2010 10:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbgrwNP_gYE" rel="nofollow">Zizek on Children of Men</a><br/><br/>It's a great commentary on the film.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271463/#Comment_271463" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T17:40:54+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  5:40PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Joshua.

There aren't really any women in the movie at all, just a pregnant black girl (I wonder if they were going for cradle of the earth or only young black girls get pregnant), the "midwife" caretaker, the mute mother who is the wife of the pothead, and one of the bravest female roles in the film portrayed by Julian Moore who doesn't last too long. So while there are women, they aren't really characters that you care about or characters that are allowed to make much of a difference. Alas, this is true of most good sci-fi films, the women are rarely the focus, and when they are, they are rarely given a voice. And when the are given a voice, its "yay sexytimes!"<br/><br/>Despite how it treats the womenfolk, I still find Children of Men a really riveting movie. I guess the action saves the real lack of heavy confrontation with social issues, and real strong character building. Actually, I just had the thought that the protagonist is pretty similar to the protagonist in Brazil. Maybe that's the trope you guys are talking about, of the middle-class white guy in sci-fi.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271697/#Comment_271697" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T13:13:21+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  1:13PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2010 1:16PM by Luke_Wheel.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite>I doubt it would be better if it confronted the issues it presented any more than it did.

I've no problem with that. It's building a world as much or more than it's building its story, and I found that compelling in its way. I mean, its quest-story is pretty complete and effective, but its world-building is really wonderful. It does a lot of showing, a lot of implying, a lot of evoking \u2014\xa0and while I can agree that the conceit that the world becomes ultra-violent without kids is an assertion that's open for debate, I don't think the film has any need to explore the alternative. It's making an assertion \u2014\xa0that the lack of a future for humanity can make people violent and unruly, just as a lack of individual futures (be they economic, political, or other) can do the same \u2014 and building on that. It's a fair argument, I think.<br/><br/>This film is a major influence on my forthcoming apocalyptic game, <i>Razed</i>, in which the apocalypse is here, it's just not evenly distributed.

It's an excellent film, with no easy answers. Luke points out some flaws in the film, which are important, although I don't think they're fatal.<br/><br/>It's also worth pointing out that it's a film by a Mexican director, adapted from a British book. It's not surprising that people from different backgrounds see different things in it. For me, it's a <i>superb</i> satire on the British police state, especially the attitude to immigration.<br/><br/>Early in the film, the guy goes about his life, trying to ignore the cages of people, armed guards and security procedures. He can't ignore them, but he carries on anyway, looking uncomfortable. It's a perfect vision of dystopian Britain.

While this runs against the grain of Althussarian 'symptomatic' readings of texts, I think it's fair to say that speculation on the absences and gaps in a text is just that, speculation. Often, this kind of speculation is of the variety that is irreflexive. If you look at what the text is not, you can find whatever it is that you are looking for because you are no longer looking at the text itself. <br/><br/>The world in Children of Men is not saved. Humanity might be, after a fashion, but only if they shed that which is hegemonic: patriarchy, state terror, Middle Class White Guys, the choosing of security over liberty, etc. Only Kee makes it to the boat, as Caron himself says: "The fact that this child will be the child of an African woman has to do with the fact that humanity started in Africa. We're putting the future of humanity in the hands of the dispossessed and creating a new humanity to spring out of that." Clive Owen character is necessarily a middle class white guy, it is he occupies a liminal structural position, neither dispossessed nor ruling elite. Thus, he acts as the vessel and threshold by which Claire-Hope Ashitey's Kee is able to cross over. He is able to move (and move Kee) between the two worlds of the hegemonic and the subaltern. Still, he has no place in Caron's utopia for the same reasons. He is a narrative reagent that get used up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272137/#Comment_272137" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T22:05:54+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 10:05PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2010 10:06PM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in love with this sentence, Nathan:<br/>\n<br/>\n"He is a narrative reagent that gets used up."<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you invent it or steal it?

I found the way that it addressed Clive Owen's fatherhood issues to be utterly striking. His evolution through the film hit me very hard. The film was not about the issues of immigration, a fucked up future, the lack of fertility, or woman giving a messianic birth. It was about a father's bond with his child and what happens when that bond is severed by tragedy.  The title Children of Men makes perfect sense to me, as does the lack of strong female characters, because like The Road, it is about fatherhood. All the rest is window dressing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272339/#Comment_272339" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T08:19:14+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  8:19AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Keith.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272373/#Comment_272373" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T11:29:39+00:00" title="May 21, 2010 11:29AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite><br/>Mostly I just get bummed when good sci-fi doesn't prominently feature women.
