                    There's a particular genre of fantastic fiction that is usually given short shrift: the kind where people, usually kids, discover a secret world and go there and have adventures. <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> is the classic example, although I particularly like Pamela Dean's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Country-Trilogy-Vol/dp/0142501530/ref=ed_oe_p/103-0504806-0672658" rel="nofollow">The Secret Country</a>, in which some kids find out that their imaginary world they made up in their play-stories (replete with character ownership, and an RPG in all but name) is real. <br/><br/>This sub-genre seems perfect for RPGs: you take yourself into a fantasy world and explore. Yet, outside of <em>Multiverser</em>, this hasn't been explored to my knowledge. In Googling for research on this post, I found this essay: "<a href="http://www.endicott-studio.com/wtrm/wrSecretCountry.html" rel="nofollow">Pamela Dean's The Secret Country and Authorial Creation</a>" and it's well-applicable to game design.<br/><br/>My point for discussion: why is this such an unexplored area of fictional content in role-playing games? A follow-up: when we talk about making some sort of cross-over game (or if we're Ryan Dancey, "<a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/C44E7E19-26A7-4C05-89B8-15803410A740.html" rel="nofollow">the emergence of a new game platform</a>"), why are we not exploring this popular, if not critically acclaimed, natural fit to the entire concept of role-playing?                </div>

                            Real or imagined links to badwrongfun, perhaps? It seems easy enough to go from saying "Let's stat ourselves up as D&amp;D characters (and get sidetracked by arguing about the improbably number of maxed out intelligence scores)" to having those same characters being sucked through a time portal or into a magic book.<br/><br/>I do recall an old paperback that followed this plot pretty closely. A bunch of off-brand D&amp;D players became their characters and had to deal with tapping into their characters' skills without having them overwhelm the original personalities. <br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that anime has explored this genre in depth, but the only shows that come to mind right now are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Hazard" rel="nofollow">El Hazard</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Kingdoms" rel="nofollow">Twleve Kingdoms</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushigi_Y%C5%ABgi" rel="nofollow">Fushigi Yugi</a>.                        </div>

                            Maybe this hasn't been represented in games because of the juvenile aspect - I think there are plenty of games and settings that explicitly allow Edgar Rice Burroughs sorts of stories (John Carter and Tarzan are both fish out of water, but supremely capable, grown up ones).  I can't think of any that encourage you to play a child or young adult, and I think that is an artifact of gamer culture.  EDIT:  The Prince's Kingdom, but I know you're going for something different here.<br/>
<br/>
As a note, this genre includes Land of the Lost and The Last Starfighter, too, right?  David Bellairs, Susan Cooper, L. Frank Baum, even Lewis Carroll (a counter-example).  The young adult/first person/fish out of water power fantasy crosses narrow genre boundaries, and if you expand the definition to include stories where children are extraordinary heroes operating outside their expected or normal surroundings, there's a ton of literature to draw from.                        </div>

It is?<br/><br/>I've played lots of games like this, and never seem to have any trouble getting the game running.<br/><br/>The thing is, do you need a new game to do it?  Many games are entirely capable of producing this kind of play.                        </div>

                            Zach,<br/><br/>I was thinking the same thing: I find the idea of "statting myself up," as we all probably did in GURPS or D&amp;D at some point, repellent. Yet I find the idea of playing a kid that discovers a magical world totally awesome. Here's the rub: what I'd really like to see, more than a game where kids make up themselves as a character and imagine that there is some device (wardrobe, spaceship, whatever) that takes them to another place is a game <em>as that actual device</em>. And I'd like it to work for adults. That's why I mentioned Ryan Dancey's blog post: a game that tells stories that is not an RPG, at least in name, is what I'm looking for - a game where you might say afterwards to a friend, "This weekend? I went to Jaipur and was Prince Monan."<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>I have some reading to do! You're right about that fish out of water fantasy - Garth Nix's <em>Sabriel</em> is the sort of story that I'm thinking of.                        </div>

<p>This sort of sounds like TSR's The Amazing Engine system. The player core, however, wasn't fleshed out much; it was just a ranking of four ability areas.</p>
<p>I bought *For Faerie, Queen and Counrty" and I think another worldbook, but loaned it to someone before I studied it in detail and never got it back. Because of that, I can't give more detail on how usable the system really was for what you have in mind.</p>

                            Just riffing off Jason's post; thinking of more examples that might fit the bill:<br/><br/>-<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/" rel="nofollow">Back to the Future</a><br/>-<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478942/" rel="nofollow">Life on Mars</a> (British TV)<br/>-<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406375/" rel="nofollow">Zathura</a>/<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113497/" rel="nofollow">Jumanji</a><br/>-<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091059/" rel="nofollow">Flight of the Navigator</a><br/>-<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102057/" rel="nofollow">Hook</a><br/><br/>So, yeah, agreed - theres lots of it going around in the film and literary mediums to be sure. In fact, come to think of it, even the old <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085011/" rel="nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> cartoon had this as a premise. <br/><br/>Its tricky to think on, because in many ways that's exactly what lots of roleplayers (myself included) have done with some characters. Sure, you're playing some burly fighter who doesn't get pushed around gym class like you do, but you're making choices that you would make much of the time, right?   I'm not shying away from the idea, but I can see where some people who are already gamers would turn up their noses at such a game, since one possible purpose of other RPGs is to eventually be able to separate character from self. But on the gateway side, that concern oughta be minimal at best. <br/><br/>As a side-note, I wonder how many LARPers essentially are doing this - just pretending that they themselves have been transported into an imaginary setting. There's much to think about here but I'm late for my date with the dishes, so I'd best be going.<br/><br/>Dave                        </div>

                            Joe,<br/><br/>I'm doing preliminary research for a game, really. As you may have read on various South American websites, I hate RPGs and so I wanted to make something that isn't one. I had a vision of a wooden box with a talking stick, 100 glass beads and a few strange colored balls (which, of course, you've seen in my Princes' Kingdom game at GenCon last year) and a pamphlet that told you how to use them to go to a fantastic land, and which had a back-story that this box is how children get to a magical land, a la the book and movie Jumanji and the board game you can buy in stores called Jumanji, which is supposed to be the board game seen in the movie.                        </div>

                            Hmmm. Yeah, IIRC there was an article in Dragon magazine way back when that discussed the idea of doing the "Modern Folk (or You Yourself) get whisked to a fantasy world" thing.  But yeah, I don't recall there ever being a game about it (there was the backstory of Castle Falkenstein which was 100% that, but never suggested that OTHER people could be play kinds of characters). As Fred suggested, you can always do it with another system, but I guess it might be interesting to explore what More could be done in a system or whatever to enhance that feel.<br/><br/>There are some other central themes to a lot of those kinds of stories: That the main character, or one of them anyway, is the Chosen One: They were brought from far away by God or Province, and they were destined to save the world somehow. Twelve Kingdoms, the above Castle Falkenstein, etc.  For this kind of thing, it might behoove the GM to set up a lot of stuff in advance: How the world works, which PC(s) is the Chosen One; How they discover this; possible repurcussions; Why they were chosen, etc. It's a lot of work, but maybe it can be distilled into a quick template or formula.  I'm really interested in this, because in the next 1-2 years I want to run a long Twelve Kingdoms game, complete with one of the PCs being a Chosen One (and even the players not knowing which one it is). I'm really interested in hearing more thoughts on this tangent, because the Chosen One thing is a big sub-category of this "Normal People, Fantasy World" thing.<br/><br/>As for your idea where you work on a game that itself proposes to be a device to travel between fantasy worlds, that's an interesting idea and I'm interested in seeing where you take it.  Might want to give Castle Falkenstein a quick read, as it does kind of a similar thing: It professes to be the diary of the person who went to another world, and maybe you'll find cool tips or tricks with which to build what you're writing.<br/><br/>If anything, though, I would actually go ahead and create a fantasy world for it.  Maybe not do the "You can go anywhere and do anything" thing... or leave that option open, but yet still build a well-defined starting setting as the Default World.  This will help you with having people jump right into the game with little trouble, which may be one of your goals (and also make suggestions that they can jump into LOTR, Harry Potter, Eragon, Neverending Story, Game of Thrones, etc if the players are familiar with those settings).  But if you leave it at "go to whichever world you want to", it might be hard for some folks to start it up; that's a lot of work for the GM to do and the players to buy into (unless again they use an already developed fantasy world).<br/><br/>Some things to consider when building such a fantasy world:<br/>* Make places for the PCs to fit in and do cool things.  Make a few "Orders/Cults/Etc" like a Knight Order, or a Mage's Guild, so that PCs have a place to plug themselves in and go on wonderous adventures or do cool things quickly.<br/>* Write well how to play up the First Journey to the fantasy world, and define clearly (even if it's using random charts) how NPCs in that world will react to the PCs, like when they see them for the first time, and when they realize they come from another world. Also how the PCs can interact quickly with the Bigwigs of that setting and get set up into doing Big Things (and not spend 4 adventures simply sulking, living out of gutters, afraid to interact with anyone for fear of being locked up, etc).<br/>* "Chosen One(s)" Option: Y / N  . If yes, figure out how the whole Chosen One thing works (maybe like CoS's Conspiracy Creation templates), how the PCs get picked, how the PCs find out about their fate, what to do to make the PCs disbelieve their Chosen One status (hey, it always happens), etc.<br/>* Imminent threats to get involved with. The world always seems in danger from without and within.<br/><br/>BTW, Twelve Kingdoms the Anime has the most awesome Chosen One scenario: As Ben puts it, there's a Chosen One, and the Chosen One's companion. The companion is pretty much "one of us" (a fantasy geek) and FLIPS THE FUCK OUT when that person realizes that they are NOT the Chosen One. It's an awesome, humanistic take on that genre.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some stuff to think about.  I'm particularly interested in pursuing more how to do this now (before such a specifically-focused game gets developed in the next 1-2 years).  Like, practical tips, templates and ideas, or side-rules (like inserting new abilities and meta-rules that can be added to ANY game) so that we could do it now, with any game system, but without leaving all the work with the GM (cause it would be a lot of work to do without simple templates, especially if there's the Chosen One stuff).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Sorry, Andy. I just hadn't seen an adult-version example yet, so I tossed out Stargate. As for doing this well at the table, Primetime Adventures seems built for this. Without any rules for special powers and whatnot, it handles Smallville (superpowered) as well as Buffy (somewhat special-powered) as well as Moose in the City (no special powers). That seems to be an important ingredient for gaming that requires normal protagonists bumping into the supernatural or otherworld.                        </div>

                            I don't think PTA addresses this question very acutely. It'd be adequate, but once you're modeling a TV show, you're already modeling another world, so you'd just be modeling taking special people from one special world and putting them in another. It might take on the problem of "normal people suddenly find that they're in a TV show" particularly interestingly, though.                        </div>

                            Clinton,<br/><br/>I don't think that it's a matter of lack of games being out there that could generate that sort of theme, but that people simply don't make an active choice to play it, or groups don't run that sort of game and so therefore, there are just less people talkinga bout it.<br/><br/>I used to play games all the time with my friends when I was growing up of "Us kids" discovering magical worlds, etc.   There are hundreds and hundreds of books that call upon that theme, and it's a fun one to dig into.  But, it's also fun to be super-heroes or have super abilities and that's why we see so many games that edge towards that instead.    In my current Beta-Test, I specifically made a point to only allow "Ordinary" protagonists.<br/><br/>Personally, I would love to play a child who steps into a magical world.   But as was stated a few posts up, most people don't want anything to do with playing children.   I do agree though that in gaming, people don't just jump to say 'normal' people.<br/><br/>It's really a player/GM thing versus a lack of games that could allow it thing though, in my eyes.                        </div>

                            I feel like this came up in part in that awesome-fy Changeling thread, where one of the suggestions/points was that most traditional fairy stories involve a normal human crossing over into the faerie world.<br/><br/>I think a game like Conquer the Horizon has legs for a particular take on the genre, where the players are inventing the world as their characters discover it. I certainly get the feeling in a world like Narnia that places practically do not exist until they come up in the narrative -- that the world of Narnia starts out being nothing more than this lamppost in a snowy woods. <br/><br/>I feel like Lacuna has something like this going on too, albeit a fair bit off to the side. Or how about a game of Don't Rest Your Head where everyone plays children?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>My point for discussion: why is this such an unexplored area of fictional content in role-playing games? A follow-up: when we talk about making some sort of cross-over game (or if we're Ryan Dancey, "<a href="http://web.mac.com/rsdancey/iWeb/RSDanceyBlog/Blog/C44E7E19-26A7-4C05-89B8-15803410A740.html" rel="nofollow">the emergence of a new game platform</a>"), why are we not exploring this popular, if not critically acclaimed, natural fit to the entire concept of role-playing?</blockquote>
I could think several reasons; first, it seems to be a taboo of a sort to play a yourself or something that could be considered to be your "avatar" instead of character. Most roleplaying games seem to advocate a certain separation of player and the character (of which I'm not fond of). Another taboo is child characters; I'm aware of few games that advocate child characters and most of them are approaching things from adult point of view - childhood fears and the stuff. I haven't checked out <i>The Zorcerer of Zo</i> yet, but I'm wondering if it has any ties for We're Not in Kansas Anymore -approach.<br/><br/>Breaking both taboos would be a wonderfull experiment. I faintly recall that we had a short <i>The Famous Five</i> -roleplaying game in a local magazine, which quite wonderfully adapted the series and gave good advice on playing in the setting.<br/><br/>Also, the subject reminds me of <i>Fionavar Tapestry</i> -series by Guy Gavriel Kay and the computer RPG series <i>Ultima</i>.                        </div>

                            Little Fears. None of the one-shots that I have been in have dealt with Closet Land in any great detail, but it sounds like Evil Narnia where kids do not want to go. This is a place of nightmare that isn't supposed to be explored so much as avoided at all costs, however.<br/><br/>The complaint about playing as children never really came up, as that's the major sell of the game. I have heard more stories of people being burned out quicker than other horror games because they were unused to the style, but I think that comes from the "playing as myself" phenomenon.<br/><br/>Reimagining this place through the lens of Clinton's idea, would the players start the game by communicating with the children (perhaps through a ouija board or other fortune telling device, since the kids are in Closet Land) and recieving information to set the scene. Then the player is sucked into the children's plot (a la Jumanji), replacing the fortune-telling device with any other resolution gimmicks.                        </div>

                            There are a few concepts that are potentially getting confused here.<br/>
<br/>
1. The "I" game. That's a game where you stat up and play yourself. The first I can think of is "Villains &amp; Vigilantes." And, yeah, it's an uncomfortable enough subject that in most play we did of the game, players made their characters using the rules for generating NPCs and did not play themselves in an alternate earth backdrop. Some few did, however, and often we'd have some of each in the same game.<br/>
<br/>
2. Playing "mundanes" thrown into a non-mundane world.<br/>
<br/>
Multiverser combines both of these ideas. But it's very possible to do either on their own, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, why don't we see more of these? Well, let's take the segments individually. For "I" games, the uncomfortableness comes, I think, from the intimacy of it. First you have to stat up your character and try to be accurate about it. The problem here is that you can be easily accused of false modesty or of self-inflation. How does a GM step in and say, "Hmmm. 15 Int? I dunno, I think you're more like a 13 or so" (and he's actually thinking 12).<br/>
<br/>
Worse, once you start playing, you're going to basically be asked questions that come down to, "If you encountered a burning building with a child in the window, and the villain is getting away, which is more important to you?" To be playing "accurately" you have to give the truthful answer about yourself. Depending on where the GM goes with this stuff, you may have to reveal some deep things about yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Further, there's the fact that there's this oddity about the character not really being you. For example, does your character play RPGs like you do? Wouldn't that lead to a lot of self-referentiality like PCs saying, "Wow, this is just like as if we were in a RPG" (see the relevant section of Over the Edge). When does the game start in your timeline? I mean for you to be you, you'd have to have gone to the same school, met the same people, had the same experiences. In V&amp;V, the problem is that you then say, "Oh, and it's all the same, except that superheroes and villains exist." Well, how would your life be the same in a world that different?<br/>
<br/>
Now, in an "Alice in Wonderland" situation you could say it's like Jumanji, or something, and that you all enter the game as you start playing the real world game. In which case, however, the self-referentiality becomes the centerpiece of the game, "Oh, wow, we started playing a RPG where we're ourselves, and now here we are in this other world. But how do we know we're real...I mean we could just be the characters in question." See Robert Heinlein's series of books on this subject (can't recall all the titles, but I think that "The Cat Who Walks Through Walls" is one of them).<br/>
<br/>
Not saying this can't be done, or couldn't be entertaining. Simply that it's all nothing like the source literature of Narnia.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and then there's the "fictional fantasy" factor. That is, if you make up something about somebody else that none of you have met, well, it could be real, right? I mean as much as Santa could be real. If you say, "I did this" as the basis of your story, you know with as much certitude as possible that you did not. As much as RPGs are mythmaking, telling them about yourself is not as effective as telling them about fictional people, because the lie is more apparent. If you will.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of point 2, why not play a normie thrown into an other world...well, simply, it's the power trip. When the main character in Gor comes to the world of Gor he comes not as himself, but as this super-powerful dude. Thomas Covenant comes across and becomes central to the entire fantasy world.<br/>
<br/>
I think that most players looking to play fantasy - possibly because they were first introduced to D&amp;D - think of it as a chance to play a character who can do things that they, themselves can't. That doesn't just mean playing an alternate mundane character, but playing somebody who can employ magic, or be a great warrior, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Not kids from London.<br/>
<br/>
From a "simmy" POV, too, it's simply interesting to explore the idea of what it would be like to be from that other place. Sure, it's easier to do the transposition with a character, because player knowledge will match character knowledge about the world. But then you don't get to ask "What's it like being from a village in the Empire of the Petal Throne?" I had one player tell me that his entire reason for playing RPGs was to do precisely this sort of exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Which, again, is not to say that you couldn't have fun doing this. Little Fears shows, I think, that "mundane" avatarism can be fun. But it's a departure from what RPGs have been thought of as being for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these are good objections, particularly, but they explain, I think, why we haven't seen more of this.<br/>

                            1. The hint of narcissism in rpgs is all the more apparent, when a player overtly chooses to<br>dwell on 'myself' as the character-focus of the game.<br><br>2. The wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue" rel="nofollow">Mary Sue</a> is enlightening,<br>and points to countless ersatz examples of 'normal people in a fantasy world' fiction; namely<br>the-author-in-a-fantasy-world.<br><br>3. Several of Jeff Freeman's old "Ack!" columns, like <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/ackjun98.html" rel="nofollow">this one,</a> drew their humor from the tiny figleaf<br>of 'character' over the huge naked personality of the players.<br><br>4. In games systems which quantitize task proficiency ability levels [In games with "stats"], playing any pre-existing character (yourself, Narnia kids) highlights the clash between minmaxing the stats for high Gamist success, vs. adhereing to Simulationist veracity, vs. cartooning the characters toward maximum Narr emo fireworks.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Mundanes into a faery-tale world, though ... isn't the advancing empowerment of the mundane usually the same story as his or her acceptance and understanding of the world that they've been thrown into?<br/>
<br/>
I mean ... it's fundamentally a coming-of-age story, paralleling the idea of juveniles being thrown into the arcane and baffling world of adult interaction.  The development of the characters may be outwardly flagged by getting the magic sword or drinking the Entish brew, but what's really happening is that the character is maturing into the type of person for whom this strange new world is natural.<br/>
<br/>
That's hard to do in RPGs, for one simple reason:  it's hard for us, as players, to remember what it's like to fear and resist the fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
As a GM I've introduced mundane characters into fantastic situations in RPGs many times, and what I have seen the <b>vast</b> majority of the time is that the players bend their character to the utmost conceivable limit in the interest of them becoming comfortable with the fantasy <i>as soon as possible</i>.  They take any sensible (and quite a few stupid) short-cuts in order to skip over that journey and get to "the good stuff."<br/>
<br/>
It is a very rare player who, even with prompting, is able to see that journey itself as the good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
How do we encourage that?  I don't really know.                        </div>

                            The WoD does help throw the theme of this kind of game into sharp relief, though: going into a new world = personal change, which can be scary and horrific in a very fundamental sense. Even if the world is Narnia. Learning is pain, right?<br><br>I think that's the biggest and best reason not to design "players play themselves" into this sort of game, as Mike said: much too threatening and intimate.

                            think along the urban fantasy segment perhaps more so. I started work on a urban fantasy setting once, that might be an idea. I love the War of the Flowers also so that is a great book to just read anyway.                        </div>

                            Ok, so I'm back from the job interview and have time to talk now.<br><br>The Undying Lands was more of an adults-in-fantasyland than the children-in-fantasyland that one finds in, say, Narnia. There was no growing-up story to be found, mostly just trying to get out and get home. This is primarily because of the different source material. I was working primarily from The War of the Flowers, Three Hearts and Three Lions, and other works that feature adults. The themes are very different even if the basic premise is the same.<br><br>As an aside, one of my big goals in that game was to make the magic of that place actually seem magical - unpredictable, arbitrary, almost incomprehensible, full of sacrifice and power - and still be playable. Very tough to do.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ben,<br><br><em>Maybe.</em> That game is a challenge and a half to even think about. I love the idea, but I think it's like asking the average person to lick a nine-volt battery because it feels really neat.<br><br>I came to this idea through packaging. I was trying to think of a use for a system I'd made, and the idea of a cooperative story-telling game with a player-created world and no GM came to me. And I thought, since the system had no normal dice or anything too RPG-looking, that it should be packaged like one of the really nice wooden-box games I keep seeing, like Dread Pirate. And then I thought of Jumanji and thought, <em>what if this was about you going from the real world to a fantasy one?</em> Again, that last connection is a scary and weird one, and we'll see.<br><br>- Clinton                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Clinton, are you talking about a game that's meant to appeal to a wider market than the folks who already play RPG's?                        </div>

                            A data point:<br>There was a game <i>almost </i>like this that was published in the mid-eighties in Germany: "Der Geheimbund des Schwarzen Auges", better known as "DSA Junior".<br><br>It was a (very short-lived) spin-off of the regular "Das Schwarze Auge/The Dark Eye" fantasy RPG aimed at younger players. It took place in the same setting, Aventuria (though whatever was established in DSA Junior was never considered canon of Aventurian history and metaplot), and used a dumbed-down version of the rules.<br>The players did not play themselves in a fantasy world, though. The characters (choice of three archetypes/classes: warrior, wizard, or rogue) were part of a secret society of "Book Guards". In that function they had to enter the worlds of books whose villains were trying to taking over the plot. As book guards they had to make sure that Tom Sawyer found his way out of the cave, if that was the adventure of the week.<br>The first adventure module (that came inside of the rules box) was called "John Silver's sinister plan - Adventures on the Treasure Island".<br/><br/>I don't know who was more vocal in criticising the game - the more earnest DSA players who felt ridiculed by having to share their fictional-but-quite-believable fantasy setting with (anachronistic) kids books, or players of all the other RPGs for whom DSA Junior was the perfect proof that DSA as a whole was an infantile game (that could never match the sincerity of, say, D&amp;D).<br/><br/>It <i>was </i>a strange set-up, having characters from a fully realized fantasy world full of adventure (which would be "real" to those characters) enter fictional worlds that were not even part of the setting.<br/><br/>Dirk                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I have some notes here on a game in which mundane people seek refuge in a world of wonder and magic, but their real-world fears manifest in that world as well, and even follow them into their normal life. There is also a chance to lose contact with one of the worlds. It turned out to be too pervy and formalized and I dropped it in favor of other projects. The working title was: "In the Unicorn's Kingdom".<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to second the suggestion that Grimm d20 from the Horizon's series by Fantasy Flight Games is a very good adaption of this very genre. I played it <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19946.0" rel="nofollow">once</a>, and it was really fun.<br/>
<br/>
As for source literature, there are also excellent novels that have grown-up people enter a phantasy world. Fionavar, anyone?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Frank T</cite>there are also excellent novels that have grown-up people enter a phantasy world</blockquote>
Like George MacDonald's <i>Phantastes</i> and <i>Lilith</i>?<br><br>Christopher Booker in <i>The Seven Basic Plots</i> has the voyage-and-return as one of his seven, using Alice in Wonderland, Orpheus, The Time Machine, Peter Rabbit and Brideshead Revisited among his examples. The book as a whole is quite flawed, like most attempts at a Unified Theory of Anything, but he has some interesting comments about the tendency of the form to involve an absolute necessity for the protagonist to leave behind something in the other world that they have come to love and return to their "real life".                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>why is this such an unexplored area of fictional content in role-playing games?</blockquote>
Unexplored in what sense?<br><br>OTE has the self-reference plot, but I suppose that doesn't really count. IIRC the original GURPS Fantasy had a suggestion of having everyone play themselves. I also seem to recall some White Wolf book suggesting basing a Vampire game in your own town and having fictionalized versions of players embraced -- but maybe I misremember. In any case, it seems to me that almost all games are open to treatment like this, but it is tricky to make a commercial game that is all about it, since the content and theme will then depend greatly on the group: you lose the ability to say "Characters in this game are X" without limiting the player population.<br/><br/>As for non-commercial stuff, I have both played in and run games like this (including a LARP), and except for the LARP I never had the sense of doing something  out of the ordinary. The games I'm talking about had various levels of "the player" injected into the the character, ranging from attempting to remain true to life to fictionalized/idealized versions ("If I were a character in a movie, what would I be like?").<br/><br/>The setup of games like this is pretty strange actually: identification with the character becomes almost automatic, since... it is you. At the same time, THE thing about immersion (being someone else) is totally missing.<br/><br/>At any rate, there is something to be said for these games as improvised one-shots: no need to spend any time at all in character generation or world building exposition.                        </br></br></div>
