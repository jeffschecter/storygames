Telling people to put 3-6 aspects on their sheet and only giving room for 4 on the character sheet is terrible in every possible way. Especially since you're meant to line them up underneath the aspect of the Struggle that is the theme of the issue. Everyone had at least 3 aspects under one side of the Struggle - not a giant surprise because obviously the Struggle was something that jumped out at them after they had just created the character. So we were piling up character sheets and lining them up and the markers for the aspects were tipping over and bumping into each other and such. Bleah!  Double-bleah on the villain sheet which requires you to use tiny markers to remind you of where the heroes' Aspects are in the plan or use pencil marks and erase them and move them up and back. Triple super bleah on the "panel-by-panel" sheet that doesn't have any clear way to remind people of which suit is punching and which suit is gloating this page. I shake my fist at the sheets for this game. <br/><br/>Second of all, and completely invalidating everything I just said forever, the thought bubble. I have used thought bubbles in comic games for yeeears. I didn't ever think to use a prop for it. And do you know why that is? It must be because <b>I am one of the dumbest creatures on God's earth.</b>  As soon as I put the thought balloon physically down, people intuitively and directly understood how they could put their Motivations at stake or in danger. It was perfect in every possible way.  <br/><br/>They were all first-time players. One had made a character who had been wrongfully convicted of a crime. Her desire to see justice done in that case was her strife aspect. Naturally the villain had framed someone for it. So the news reaches her that the case has been re-opened. She picks up the thought balloon, holds it over her head, in the most plaintive voice imaginable says, "Does this mean I might get my life back?!" I melted into a little puddle of happy GM-ness with little hearts in my eyes and stars whirling around my head. Everyone else did too.<br/><br/>I misread a card-playing rule that let conflicts drag on too much - if I had read it right, I think the Plan would have succeeded in the first few pages because nobody, NOBODY ever wanted to let the villains win and they would have thrown their aspects out the window to beat those bastards. Because they were evil villains. I was happy. Anyway, even with the misreading things were great fun and we enjoyed ourselves greatly.<br/><br/>One other set of optional rules that might be fun is to reduce the hand size for everyone and instead of play-by-plays, do everything in the same manner as the enrichment scene single-card plays where the loser gets the cards. This would make it more give-and-take individually, a little less like a glorious Silver Age donnybrook and more a broody "lots of little vignettes" modern comic.<br/><br/>All in all, a great success.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177191/#Comment_177191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T12:54:47+00:00" title="November  3, 2008 12:54PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thought bubble is gold!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177200/#Comment_177200" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T13:53:27+00:00" title="November  3, 2008  1:53PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we used the thought bubble once in our Night Watch game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177237/#Comment_177237" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-03T22:36:06+00:00" title="November  3, 2008 10:36PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Triple super bleah on the "panel-by-panel" sheet that doesn't have any clear way to remind people of which suit is punching and which suit is gloating this page.</blockquote>\nYou don't really need to remember.  The only thing that matters is the last card.  So, if it's on "Manuerving" and Hearts are the active suit, then Hearts are manuervering. If the other player plays a Diamond and throws a punch, and you play a Heart, you can make the Heart be anything else, manuevering, power use, gloating, whatever just not punching (because that's what diamond is).  Actually, since there's two settings (I don't remember the other one, but something like offense and defense?) you can just change the second setting.  But the suits are not set in stone for the whole page.<br/><br/>I agree some things are tricky to get a handle on (mine felt like a disaster compared to how smoothly Kat Miller runs it), but over all a good game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177255/#Comment_177255" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T06:37:33+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  6:37AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really?
