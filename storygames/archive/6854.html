Players dive right in, get to the meat of what their characters want and develop the game around those themes. <br/><br/>If you're playing D&amp;D, you know what you character wants too, but it's deferred by encounters that are designed to make you tough enough to overcome the final challenge in which you get what you want, and find that there's something else you want.<br/><br/>In Story Games, the delivery is much more immediate. In IAWA, octaNe or Polaris, Dogs even, you can just narrate yourself straight into a situation in which you deal with the issue and resolve it. Some Story Games have built in mechisms for deferring the final resolution. Inspectres (which I finally got to play, albeit in an Edwardian Little Marple on the Wold Style) has franchise points, the Roach has a set number of scenes as has Mountain Witch. But in my experience it can be a real problem if players just shoot off and resolve everything because it destroys the development that is necessary to make the story satisfactory. It's all start and end with no middle.<br/><br/>Is this because the middle is a dull area of moral ambiguity and little in the way of excitement? Is it because the mechanics don't reward players for dallying (indeed most mechanics just slow things down rather than giving importance to the development). GUMSHOE does give a reason to pay attention to things other than the core clues by surrounding the mystery with supplementary information and bonuses which aren't necessary to understand the mystery but are usually needed if the characters are going to triumph.<br/><br/>What else do you see as a good way of slowing down the rush to the goal, to making it a proper story?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152519/#Comment_152519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T16:18:15+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  4:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "This never happens to me."<br/><br/>Well, there's a solution.<br/><br/>It's possible to overcome premature narration, but communication between partners is crucial. A high level of trust must be established, and it's important to try to reduce pressure and tension by reducing expectations, at least initially.<br/><br/>In clinical cases, various medications are being tested to help slow down the speed of the narrative response. However, premature narration can be prevented without pharmaceuticals by using exercises that concentrate on reconditioning the story reflex and the patient's ability to deal with dramatic stimulation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152520/#Comment_152520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T16:20:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  4:20PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>What else do you see as a good way of slowing down the rush to the goal, to making it a proper story?</blockquote>\nMore characters, more problems, a tolerance for tangents...<br/><br/>Plenty of people don't want this, though.

It's the GM who do it. So the GM control much of the pacing of the game (and both games are multi-episode, so even if a single episode is short, the story isn't over). <br/><br/>So, if the problem isn't about the framing of the scenes, I am not sure what it is about: the players resolve whole chunks of backstory with a single conflict?

Then you have to make sure everyone's on board with how much foreplay is enough, and that's tough. Definitely a case of system mattering.<br/><br/>There are some interesting takes on "required" pre-conflict buildup already out there. The more I play <i>Dust Devils</i>, for example, the more I've come to appreciate the pacing mechanism built into Harm, as well as the opportunity to Fold before you pop the cork. We've ended up with some very, very tense buildups but we had a clever, nuanced system to help get us there. Same thing with the scene economy in <i>Burning Empires</i>, as well as the conflict-setting advice in both BE and BW. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152536/#Comment_152536" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T16:43:22+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  4:43PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Or speed it up, depending on the system.<br/>\n(Usually, just making characters is the set-up for most games, anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for getting into a sitation and resolving it, that's what it's about whether you're talking D&amp;D, Vampire or Dogs. Any RPG-type-game, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for slowing down the rush to the goal... any problem the players have to deal with is going to do that.

Like a clock based on hero points or re-rolls or hand size or whatever mechanic you prefer that automatically switches the game into high gear when X resource runs out or gets too large.

Like <br/><br/>"I convince her to marry me."<br/><br/>*clatter*<br/><br/>"Ok, we're married."<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>"I save the kingdom"<br/><br/>*clatter*<br/><br/>"Hooray! Now I'm a hero!"<br/><br/>In both situations, I think the solution is the same, and it's what's been suggested to a lot of IaWA players: ask "how?"<br/><br/>I've found that a lot of my games have been really improved by burrowing into the nitty-gritty of scenes - making the stakes and the conflicts really specific - we don't know whether or not she'll marry you yet, we only know whether you bought a nice wedding ring, or some tacky piece of crap.  This fulfills exactly the funtion that the "middle" of the story should - when we eventually find out if the two get married or not, knowing details like how he stuggled over buying the ring - that she turned him down even though it was a great ring, or that she married him despite (or because of) the crappy ring he bought, gives the story much more resonance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152563/#Comment_152563" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T18:24:48+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  6:24PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Or rather, look at it this way, what is it that makes those fast resolutions interesting that you don't think you'd get by going slower.

Do the emotions have to be high to make it interesting? Does everything have to be on the line?</blockquote>\nWell, let me ask another question, what happens when the hero seems to have solved his problems in chapter 1 or the first 20 minutes of a movie?  It means there's bigger stuff down the pipe - probably as a direct result of those (hasty?) "solutions"!  So, the first stake might be something about getting to work on time for a meeting, or it might be taking over control of the company. It doesn't finish the story, but instead sets the scope.  When it comes up, it might be the player simply wanting a bigger scope.  But it might also be the player just pushing the boundries too far.  And if it's Dogs or IAWA, where you as GM have scene framing authority, that's when you go, "Whoa, whoa, slow down sparky. How are you going to take control over the company? You work in the mail room!" Maybe they have a kick ass idea that sells you on doing it in a conflict, probably not, and they explain and explain and finally you end up with a scene appropriate conflict.  If it's a game like PTA or Capes, where players share scene framing authority, then you can veto or reframe it until everyone is happy, but it's more important to make sure that there's no big resolution, because you might not have the power to raise the follow up stakes.<br/><br/>In short, you have to slow them down. Frame scenes that come at a small part of their big goal. Reign them back when they can frame the conflict.<br/><br/>The tricky thing about it, is that you have to move with the system.  Something might seem too small, or too big, but depending on if they succeed or fail, the conflict can turn around and make the story interesting. Although it can be a gamble, sometimes the system gives you give players enough rope to hang themselves (PTA budget, Dogs demon influece, Capes debt/story tokens). The middle of the story shouldn't be dull ambiguitiy. But a series of small victories mixed in with defeats (and in compelling written media, the defeats are usually much larger in scope). So, when they fail those small conflicts, make it hurt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152588/#Comment_152588" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T20:46:47+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  8:46PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey GB Steve:<br/>\n<br/>\n"But in my experience it can be a real problem if players just shoot off and resolve everything because it destroys the development that is necessary to make the story satisfactory.

In practice my GMing role has often been concerned with either affirming details so the game proceeds fluidly, or requiring players to split material into concretely imaginable bits that are actually dealt with procedurally and separately in-game. Then again, when the group gets actually invested in the fictional contents, this process flows instinctively and naturally - everybody realizes that the interesting thing is <i>here and now</i>, in the process, not in jumping ahead or fiddling with secondary details. When the game clicks like that, it's extremely easy to flow from one scene to another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152639/#Comment_152639" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T04:12:41+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  4:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd agree about the detail problem, and it has been discussed here before I think.<br/><br/>Sometimes people get so focussed on the what (defeating the bad guy, winning power, saving the world, confronting their nemesis) that they totally forget the How. You can see it just as much in a task-resolution game like GURPS, e.g. in combat where it all degrades into a succession of hit and damage rolls without any notion of what is actually happening in the SIS, and you can see it in a Narrative game where people skip the story to get to the resolution (or do the type of dysfunctional stakes setting where you skip the actual conflict entirely).<br/><br/>Doing this now and again is fine, usually people are just carried away with the story or the mechanics and forget about the actual imaginary action that's going on, but when it happens too often in a game it is, to me, dysfunctional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152643/#Comment_152643" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T05:00:11+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  5:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a similar discussion over at the <a href="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/node/1211" rel="nofollow">Collective Endeavour</a> a while back, which touched on skipping to the high points, amongst other things.
