To each d6, add your relevant stat. Every 6 or higher is a success. A roll of 1 is always a miss. <br/><br/>If you get: <br/>No successes = GM makes a hard move ("Your sword strike is deflected by the goblin's buckler and it swipes its claws at your face, take damage.")<br/>1 success = GM makes a soft move ("Your sword strike is deflected by the goblin's buckler and it swipes its claws at your face, what do you do?")<br/>2 successes = GM chooses between a hard bargain, a worse outcome, or a terrible choice ("You can strike the goblin with your sword, but if you do then the goblin will get a swipe at you before it expires. What do you do?")<br/>3 successes = GM offers full success ("You strike the goblin's head off its shoulders with your sword, huzzah!")<br/><br/>By default, PCs will be rolling 3d6. Additional dice come from Assets, each of which has a number of six-sided dice on it. An Asset can be used to add its full number of additional dice to the roll, but then the Asset's die pool will be reduced by 1, after the roll. <br/><br/>Every player can remove a die from the die pool that he or she would roll to add +1 to all remaining dice. This must be done before the roll. <br/><br/>Out of 10 verbs to describe possible actions, characters will have +2 on 2 verbs, +1 on 3 verbs, and 0 on the rest. <br/><br/>I'd love to hear any feedback on this system.

It's not exactly for a hack, as it is for a whole new system-y game-y thing I'm dabbling around with.<br/><br/>Setting: A giant sentient city has come to a pristine, untamed, vicious, beautiful wilderness and has started to eat that wilderness. One player plays the city, one player plays the land, and the other players play Pawns, the people caught in the struggle who will ultimately decide which half of the fight wins. So both the city and the land are attempting to woo the Pawns over to their side of the fight.<br/><br/>Mechanically: So, things are hard for the Pawns to do. Not impossible, but not easy. They've got their own assets, from when they started the game, but assets dwindle in utility as you use them, so that's just a temporary solution. If the Pawns want to get anything done, they're probably going to have to start working with the city or the land. The players of the city and the land each have big ole piles of dice that they can assign into assets, on the fly, and then grant to the Pawns. So the city might say, "Here you go! It's a corps of our steam-powered police force, come to help you kill that monster!" The land might say, "Here you go! It's a giant monster, come to help you smash those steam-powered clanky bastards!" The Pawns get to keep the assets until they're used up. But as the Pawns use assets from either the city or the land, they actually sway themselves towards those sides, making it more and more likely that they will gain permanent Scars or permanent Brass, with Scars connecting them to the land, and Brass connecting them to the city. <br/><br/>I can get into more granular detail, but hopefully that's enough to explain what the general game is like.<br/><br/>What I'm hoping to get out of this system is what I described above. Something easy, without too much math or fiddliness; something where the Pawns will likely need the help of one of the two god-beings, the city or the land, to succeed; and something where the city and the land can easily and quickly create the assets they want to give to the Pawns.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397362/#Comment_397362" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T13:22:39+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  1:22PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2012 1:23PM by David Artman.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far, it's fairly straight-forward, but I think you'll find individual die math and handling of pools of more than about five dice to be slow.<br/><br/>Also, why not rephrase it where a Verb reduces the target number (-2/-1) rather than adds to the dice? Seems faster to realize in play, to me. Further, one could note the actual success target on a character sheet, rather than the -2/-1, and eliminate almost all dice math (except the bonus, below).<br/><br/>Example:<br/><b>Gandalf</b><br/>Blasting: 4<br/>Smoking: 4<br/>Researching: 5<br/>Pontificating: 5<br/>Riding: 5<br/><br/>...Hmmm... and trying to make that example shows me how hard it is to characterize "abilities" as Verbs rather than Nouns (note that all my "verbs" are actually gerunds, which are nouns). I'd expand to allow for Nouns and even Adjectives, in true trait-y fashion. But I see how you might want to heavily emphasize action elements over more hippy-gaming soft/interpretive elements\n<blockquote>Every player can remove a die from the die pool that he or she would roll to add +1 to all remaining dice. This must be done before the roll.</blockquote>\nWow, this seems SUPER powerful, to me, but I'd have to play it out over time to be sure.<br/><br/>Also, as above, I'd say "Every player can remove a die from the die pool that he or she would roll <b>to reduce the target value for success by 1 (i.e., from 6 to 5, from 5 to 4, or from 4 to 3, depending on the Verb being used). Limit one die removal for this reduction in target value per test</b>."<br/><br/>But, yeah... looking pretty AW-ish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397365/#Comment_397365" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T13:40:54+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  1:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks David! <br/><br/>Yeah, having it so the target number is reduced, and you just list the target number for each verb, makes an enormous amount of sense. Much simpler. <br/><br/>As for the verbs themselves, I have a specific list of verbs selected. 5 verbs are associated with the city, 5 with the land. On the city's end, you've got: Bribe, Break, Charge, Command, and Scour. On the land's end, you've got: Kill, Hide, Sense, Endure, and Threaten. These aren't finalized at all, and I'm not envisioning them as being too restrictive, at least at the moment. So, Hide might cover sneaking, as well as hiding. It might cover legerdemain, too. <br/><br/>I'm envisioning everybody having these same 10 verbs. When you get more Brass, you get better at all of the city's verbs. When you get more Scars, you get better at all of the land's verbs. <br/><br/>The super powerful bit is something I'm still thinking about. If you react that strongly to it, then I'll definitely be wary of it, and make sure to test it.<br/><br/>I'm actually fine with it being AW-ish (I mean, I love that game, and personally I'm content to emulate the shit out of it), as long as it also does what I want it to do. <br/><br/>My question for you, David: I can absolutely see what you mean when you say pools of more than 5 dice might be slow. Do you think that's an easily solved problem? Do you think that undermines and ruins the whole kit 'n' kaboodle? Or do you think it's just one of those, "Welp, we do what we have to" issues? I understand that ultimately, play is what will determine the actual answer, but I'm curious from a theoretical design perspective what your thoughts might be. <br/><br/>Thanks again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397368/#Comment_397368" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T13:58:13+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  1:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2012 2:01PM by David Artman.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the math is front-loaded (except for the "remove a die" bit during play) then you're just checking against a target. That is not slow at all, which is why I suggested reduction of target rather than addition to die values per roll.<br/><br/>I can sort ten d6s by over/under value X in maybe five seconds, so it's not an issue in that mode. <br/>Frankly, were I playing, I'd flip to that mode anyway: "I'm using Endure at +1 so my target is 5."

Then, I'm thinking that it worked okay with just 7 basic moves for AW -- which, admittedly, were well-defined while highly versatile, and therefore not exactly like these verbs, but I'm hoping to ultimately appeal to a similar style. Finally -- and this is more me trying to achieve some level of psychological manipulation on the players -- I'm counting on the old "every problem looks like a nail when all you've got is a hammer" to help me out. This list of verbs might not cover all actions possible in the world, ever. But they inform what the game is like, its style, and the actions that might be the first resort. <br/><br/>This is something I think would only come out in play. <br/><br/>Thanks again for your help!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397380/#Comment_397380" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T14:40:14+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  2:40PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>This is something I think would only come out in play. </blockquote>\nTrue, as with all games.

It's certainly inspired by AW, so it makes sense that it's not too different. <br/><br/>"Non-linear improvement in odds as you increase the number of dice rolled for a system like this..." I apologize for being thick, but I'm not sure I quite understand what you mean here. You want an exponential progression, in terms of greater likelihood of success? Where it's not just like, "One die gives me a 1/6 chance at success, two dice gives me a 2/6 chance, three dice gives me a 3/6 chance," but something where more dice are significantly better than fewer? Would you be so kind as to provide me with an example of what you mean, so I can try to wrap my head around it? Thanks!<br/><br/>As for how easy it is to get dice, well, they're always there, but you've got to ask the land or the city to help you out if you want some. What's more, they have limited supplies to hand out, so they might choose not to give you more, if you've already gotten a bunch. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm thinking interaction between the players will more determine the availability of additional dice to you than will pure mechanics or supply. <br/><br/>The "drop one die to decrease the difficulty" mechanic is in there as an alternative means of increasing your chance of success. My thinking was basically that by default, you get only 3 dice, and each will only succeed on a 6. If you've got your verb improved, then you can have a difficulty of only 4, so that's much better, but for most verbs, you'll actually have a difficulty of 6. Then, let's say you use your 3 Asset, so now you're rolling 6 dice. But you still only hit on a difficulty of 6, and you really want to get at least 2 successes, right? So maybe instead of rolling all 6 dice, you drop 2, and now you're rolling 4 dice but your difficulty is 4. That gives you a much better shot of getting those 2 successes you wanted, but at the risk of having fewer chances to succeed (fewer dice).<br/><br/>I'm not attached to it, really; I'm hearing a lot of concern over it, so I'm thinking that maybe I should drop it. I guess I was providing another means to help mitigate difficulty for the Pawns (the PCs), but only if they have plenty of dice already, which means that more than likely they've already made a deal with the city or the land, which is what I want to encourage.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397496/#Comment_397496" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T12:17:45+00:00" title="November 14, 2012 12:17PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2012 12:24PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see. So it's basically a way to help a player who is rolling lots of dice but doesn't have a good Verb? That makes sense, if it works as desired. (It might be one of those options that you might as well always choose, because it's so beneficial.)<br/><br/>For instance, with six dice and a difficulty of 6, your odds aren't that great. You have a decent chance of failing altogether (about 34%), and little chance of a "strong hit" (about 6%).<br/><br/>With four dice and a difficulty of 4, your odds are dramatically better: only a 6% chance of a miss, and good odds of a strong hit (about 31%). <br/><br/>I'm going to guess that under this system you should ALWAYS roll no more than three dice. So I think the effect is too large, or it should just be the rule (for dice over 3, just subtract 1 from your difficulty instead).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397498/#Comment_397498" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T12:23:55+00:00" title="November 14, 2012 12:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for the "linear" comment, what I mean is this:<br/><br/>If each die has an equal chance of scoring a "hit", then adding one more die always has the same value to the player. Roll enough dice, and you're guaranteed to succeed.<br/><br/>In a non-linear system, though, each subsequent die you add is less effective. Add enough dice, and it's hardly worth it anymore: it barely increases your odds.<br/><br/>One example would be like this:<br/><br/>Instead of your verb reducing the difficulty number, it changes one of the dice you roll. For your "zero" verbs, just roll your 3d6. For a "+1" verb, change one of the dice to a d8. For a "+2" verb, change one die to a d10, instead.<br/><br/>So now you can have a "+5" verb (giving you a d30 or something), which is nice--almost a guaranteed "hit"--but still doesn't mean you're going to get what you want if the other dice roll poorly. <br/><br/>If assets "stack" the same way, you have a similar effect for additional assets: they help, sure, but only to a certain point.<br/><br/>(That's just one example, there are many other ways to do this without changing die types.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397509/#Comment_397509" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T14:02:24+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  2:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2012 2:07PM by Brendan_Conway.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The effect seems too strong -- yeah, that makes a lot of sense, thanks very much for the tip! I'll try it without that, at all, but what if you could drop the difficulty on all dice by 1 for every 2 dice you ditch? So, you have a dice pool of 6 and a difficulty of 6. To get it down to a difficulty of 4, you'd only have 2 dice left. So it's there as an option, if you want to take advantage, but not terribly useful. Would that solve the problem? Does it seem unnecessary? <br/><br/>The linear system -- AH! Okay, yes, I get it now! Thanks very much! <br/><br/>The die changing idea is very interesting. Reminds me of Cortex a bit. Grab your 3d6, except you're using your Bribe verb, which you have at +2, so that turns a d6 into a d10. And then you're throwing in a 4 point asset, which gives you a d12. So you're rolling 2d6, a d10, and a d12. And maybe no asset can go over 5 points, which is a d20. Static difficulty of 6. <br/><br/>I think I'd want to think about that system, and try out the one I initially proposed, before I went for a switch. But this one is definitely very interesting to me. Thanks for the idea!<br/><br/>I wonder...tell me if this changes some of your opinions about the system as it exists. <br/><br/>Okay, so, you've got this thing you want to do, let's say you want to Kill a guard. You've got your base 3d6, and you've got your Kill difficulty at 5. But you really want to make sure this gets done. So you're thinking of bringing in that asset the land gave you, the razor sharp stone knife that you found in the cave. It's a 4 Asset right now, so now you've got 7d6. That's actually not too shabby, and you're willing to go ahead with that, thinking those additional dice are all pretty sweet.<br/><br/>But! Every single die you use from an asset of the land or the city comes back to haunt you. At the end of the session, you tally up all the asset dice you've rolled from both sides, total. So if you've rolled 10 dice that've come from the land's assets, then you'd roll that, and you'd also roll the 8 dice you've rolled from the city's assets. And now you're looking at which total is higher, and the difference. <br/><br/>If the difference is over 10 (number subject to change), then that's (sort of) a good thing! You're now going to get either a Scars or a Brass, depending upon which side was higher, but its representation is going to be something positive maybe. So, for instance, your positive 6 Brass might mean that you have a hand replaced with a gleaming, perfect brass hand. It feels like flesh, though, and you haven't even lost sensation. How's that for craftsmanship! And that hand is your new point of Brass. Of course, the side effect is that this means that the city owns you, just a little bit more. <br/><br/>If the difference is over 5, then you're still getting the Scars or the Brass, but neither you nor the affiliated god-power gets to decide what form it takes. Instead, the opposed god-power gets to decide what form it takes. So, your positive 3 Brass means that the land gets to tell you the form of your new Brass point. This might mean that the Denizens of the city went to replace your hand with that wonder hand from above, but it got all botched up. Instead, there's this ugly clamp sticking out of the end of your wrist, heavy, powerful, and frightening. The metal is dulled, and your skin is stretched out across the metal where the meet, and it oozes. You still get the point of Brass, and the city still owns you a bit more, but...man is that horrible. <br/><br/>If the difference is 5 or less, then you're still you. You kept yourself separate from the two god-powers. You're your own person. No Brass, no Scars for you. Instead, your base pool, called Self, that 3d6 you normally start with, gets increased. Now you have 4d6, to represent how you asserted yourself and kept your independence. Probably at great cost, but still. Bully for you. <br/><br/>The reason why I mention all of this vis a vis your concern about the linear dice system is to say that simply rolling more dice isn't always better. The more dice you roll, the more likely you are to be forcibly given a point of Brass or a point of Scars, as appropriate. So it's not that they're not effective; it's that they come with a cost.<br/><br/>Also, just to be clear, the land and the city can totally fuck with you by using your own Brass or Scars against you, if you're not doing stuff they like.

Especially the one about the soft move, which also jumped out at me as being a little odd. In particular, if the MC makes a soft move, then you roll to try to avoid the danger... and the result is another soft move... what happens now? Do you just roll again?<br/><br/>As for your most recent post:<br/><br/>I really like what you're describing in regards to gaining various possible character changes, it sounds like a really cool balance. That sounds like a really fun dynamic, and will push your character in different directions if it's set up right.<br/><br/>However, I do NOT think that the system you've described gives you the odds you (probably) want. So, I suggest you do some serious math/testing before you worry about how to tinker with this mechanic. One of the reasons is that, if dropping dice gives you such a huge advantage, people will always tend to do that: it removes the choice you're trying to build.<br/><br/><br/>(Why do I think you haven't done the math? That example of the 7d6 being "not too shabby". Let's look at the odds. Approximately:<br/><br/>Total miss: 28%<br/>Soft miss: 39%<br/>Partial success: 23%<br/>Full success: Just under 10%<br/><br/>That means on a 7d6 roll, you will only succeed about 1/3 of the time, and most of those will be partial successes (e.g. "a worse outcome or an ugly choice"). That seems pretty grim to me. It's barely any better than rolling at -2 in Apocalypse World.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397550/#Comment_397550" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T19:03:06+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  7:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: \n<blockquote>For example, how do you know when to roll? Does it derrive from the fiction?</blockquote>\nI was pretty much going for an AW thing here, too. I have the ten verbs I mentioned (Bribe, Break, Charge, Command, Scour, Kill, Hide, Sense, Endure, and Threaten). When you Endure something, roll. When you Kill something, roll. When you Break something, roll. Of course, there is the possibility here of "over-rolling," of these verbs being too openly defined, not as specific as AW moves. I'm sort of hoping that basic *World principles would help to explain that, but I probably need to put in the work to specifically explain the conditions in which I want there to be rolling in this game. But yes, I was planning on it deriving from the fiction. \n<blockquote>Also, I'm a bit wary of codifying soft moves in the mechanics, because in most AW hacks (though maybe not all), the GM is making soft moves all the time, just based on the normal demands of the fiction. </blockquote>\nSo, the soft moves thing was me saying, "Okay, now there are 4 different levels of success, clearly codified, with two of them being misses and two of them being hits." I don't think I wanted to imply that this is the only case in which you'd have soft moves; just that, specifically, when rolls are made, this is when you make a soft move. I wanted to include another form of miss, because I wanted to emphasize that it's tough for Pawns (PCs) to do stuff. <br/><br/>Is the wariness of codifying soft moves the fear that by codifying them, I'm making it so they won't otherwise be enacted? <br/><br/>Also, this game will not have a single GM, which is another reason why I felt that codifying them would help. This game has 2 GMs. Part of the screwiness of what I'm doing may be my attempts to deal with that fundamental issue. I would hope that this would actually help with the 2 GMs, but I could totally be wrong! \n<blockquote>In terms of straight up mechanics, it seems much more mechanically complicated (more dice, more math, counting successes, etc.) and I'm not sure what depth it offers in return. Am I missing something?</blockquote>\nYou're missing my GENIUS! GENIUS I SAY! <br/><br/>*Ahem* Excuse me. Seriously: <br/><br/>It is much more mechanically complicated, that's for damn sure. The depth it offers is something that's hard for me to articulate, but here goes. <br/><br/>A lot of this game is the feeling on the part of the Pawns that they need either the city or the land to help them overcome the odds. I wanted that to psychologically exist somewhere. Plus one, minus one, that stuff generally is boring to me, not evocative one way or another. But seeing that I've got 3 dice, and only 3 dice? That's meaningful. It's physical, tangible. And then, seeing that the city and the land have these massive piles of dice in front of them? Similarly, it communicates something. And then, when the city hands me an asset, with a big ole pile of dice on it, and suddenly I feel empowered, because those dice are mine? That's an instantaneous good feeling.<br/><br/>So what do I get, what's the depth from this system? I think it's in that exchange of dice, and the nature of the dice themselves. AW puts the focus on the results of the roll. This system might put the focus on the roll itself, on that feeling of "Am I gonna make it?" <br/><br/>Or at least, that's what I want to believe, what I really want to believe. This might also be bullshit to people who haven't drunk my particular brand of Kool-Aid.\n<blockquote>If you want something that's "like AW, but simpler" there are several of those options available.

I don't want "AW but simpler," necessarily. I want "AW style resolution" with 2 GMs offering power and dice to the PCs and tempting them into corruption. World of Dungeons and World of Warhammer might be more successful at being pure 1-core-move AW hacks, but that's not really what I'm after, not least because I don't really think this is an AW hack, or if it is, it's a pretty extreme hack.<br/><br/>Or at least, again, this is my belief. But I'd love to hear more about why I'm wrong! It's really interesting, seriously! Thanks for the thoughts!

You struck at the goblin with your sword, now it's leaping at your throat. What do you do? It's a move snowball, isn't it? It's just that whereas in most *World games, it's left up to the MC whether she goes straight for the hard move ("You take damage!") or stops at the soft ("It's at your throat, what do you do?"). I'm just codifying it as to when, specifically, it goes to soft. If it goes to hard, it's still left up to GM judgment, how hard the move is, but when it's that 1 success, it's always soft, and it just leads to what happens next. <br/><br/>And just because it's soft doesn't mean it can't affect multiple people. "The goblin tackles him and is at his throat! You're his buddy, what do you do?" That should help moves snowball, too. I'd think. I'd hope. \n<blockquote>As for your most recent post:<br/><br/>I really like what you're describing in regards to gaining various possible character changes, it sounds like a really cool balance. That sounds like a really fun dynamic, and will push your character in different directions if it's set up right.<br/><br/>However, I do NOT think that the system you've described gives you the odds you (probably) want. So, I suggest you do some serious math/testing before you worry about how to tinker with this mechanic. One of the reasons is that, if dropping dice gives you such a huge advantage, people will always tend to do that: it removes the choice you're trying to build.<br/><br/><br/>(Why do I think you haven't done the math? That example of the 7d6 being "not too shabby". Let's look at the odds. Approximately:<br/><br/>Total miss: 28%<br/>Soft miss: 39%<br/>Partial success: 23%<br/>Full success: Just under 10%<br/><br/>That means on a 7d6 roll, you will only succeed about 1/3 of the time, and most of those will be partial successes (e.g. "a worse outcome or an ugly choice"). That seems pretty grim to me. It's barely any better than rolling at -2 in Apocalypse World.)</blockquote>\nNailed me. Sorry about that; I may have jumped the gun, posting about this (especially after reading Mr. Morningstar's thoughts in that other thread about the new game that was whipped up without as much thought as it might have needed). I definitely need to get this math hammered out, and because I'm a dimwit, that's probably only going to come out through lots of playtesting. But thanks so much for your analysis and thoughts on the probabilities, because it's very, very helpful for me!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397558/#Comment_397558" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T22:38:03+00:00" title="November 14, 2012 10:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still pretty in love with your basic idea here, Brendan.

Thanks so much for offering to help!<br/><br/>Okay. I'm trying to be as useful as I can with this description. <br/><br/>Fundamentally, I want the PCs to have some chance of success on their own, but I want it to be relatively low. Closer to hitting 1/3 or 1/4 of the time, instead of 1/2. For instance, giving each PC 3 dice by default, where 2 successes is a basic hit, and you get a success if you roll a 4 or higher on a d6, seemed like it would give the Pawns slightly too much independent success than I wanted. In AW, interpreted through my incredibly limited understanding, if you have a +0, you should be hitting more often than not, as you hit on a 7 or higher, which is too much for what I wanted. So the key principle I had in mind here is, "Success is possible! But really chancy." <br/><br/>(Arguably, this is already where the issue lies -- maybe success 1/2 of the time already gets what I wanted, with that "possible but unlikely" element.) <br/><br/>Right now, I have ever Pawn starting the game with their 3 base dice, and then 3 additional assets, ranked 3, 2, and 1. I wanted those to give enough of a boost that they might tide you over in the beginning, but they dwindle quick. And then, you really  need those other assets from the city and the land. So, here, I'm looking for a situation where an asset with a number that will dwindle relatively quickly will actually significantly increase odds of success. <br/><br/>And then, finally, when the land or the city chucks an asset your way, I want it to really matter. I'm imagining that those two players aren't going to be doling out assets ranked lower than 3 very often, and might more often be doling out 5 or 6 ranked assets. So, the idea would be that the base 3d6 of the player, coupled with the additional 5d6 of one of the land or city's assets, should put you at a place where getting a hit (2 successes) is pretty likely, and getting a full hit (3 successes) has decent chances. <br/><br/>The base "success number" was 6 partly because I was inspired by the board game Eclipse and how it does combat (I'm just stealing from EVERYONE up in here), partly because it seemed pretty easy to remember as a default, and partly because anything lower seemed like it would significantly shift odds in favor of success, but that number is certainly changeable. Furthermore, I went with d6s because everybody has them (though maybe not in the ridiculous quantities I'm suggesting), but the die size is easily changeable.<br/><br/>I hope that this explains some of my reasoning and thinking in a clear fashion, and thank you so, so much for your help, Matt! Thank you thank you thank you!<br/><br/>(And I'd love to hear your answers to Paul's question, too!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397596/#Comment_397596" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-15T10:45:05+00:00" title="November 15, 2012 10:45AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How important is it to you to keep the distinction between "partial success" and "partial miss" ("MC makes a soft move")?<br/><br/>Would a three-tiered outcome (as in Apocalypse World) do the trick for you?<br/><br/>Here's 3d6 with a target of 6:<br/><br/>0: 150/216, 69%<br/>1: 55/216, 25%<br/>2: 10/216, 5%<br/>3: 1/216, 0.5%<br/><br/>That's a 84% chance of total failure, 5% partial success, 0.5% full success.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that's far more grim than you're going for. (5% chance is like having to roll a 20 on a d20... and that's just for a partial success.)<br/><br/>If you treat 0 is a miss, 1 as a partial hit, and 2 as a full success, it's a little more reasonable, but still very grim.<br/><br/>Now what if you got to roll an extra die for your verb, and it could be a d6, d8, or d10? I'm short on time so I'll just do a d10 to see how the odds look. (Approximate percentages here again.)<br/><br/>0: 150/432, 35%<br/>1: 205/432, 47%<br/>2: 65/432, 15%<br/>3+: 12/432, 2.8%<br/><br/>That still really sucks if you're using the four-tiered system, but is pretty good if you're using three tiers:<br/><br/>Miss: 35%<br/>Partial hit: 47%<br/>Full success: 18%<br/><br/>So maybe that's too strong for you. On the other hand, this is the player's main strength, their best Verb. <br/><br/>What about if the Verb die replaces one of the original 3d6? So this PC would roll 2d6+1d10, counting 6+. Then it's like this:<br/><br/>0: 30/72, 42%<br/>1: 35/72, 49%<br/>2: 6/72, 8%<br/>3: 1/72, ~1%<br/> <br/>With your four tiers, that's really rough. <br/><br/>With three tiers:<br/><br/>Miss: 42%<br/>Partial hit: 49%<br/>Full success: 9%<br/><br/>That's not bad, to my eyes. It's still really rough odds, but it's close to your 50/50 success/failure, if that's what you want for your game.<br/><br/>If this same character is rolling in +5d6 from an Asset, their odds look like this (approximately):<br/><br/>0: 17%<br/>1: 36%<br/>2: 32%<br/>3+: 15%<br/><br/>With three tiers:<br/><br/>Miss: 17%<br/>Partial hit: 36%<br/>Full success: 47%<br/><br/>Well, that gives you some tough choices. What do you want the odds to look like in your game? How often do you expect people to roll without calling in any Assets at all?<br/><br/>More importantly, perhaps: I did all of these probabilities in a rush, and I may have screwed up some. So consider this a back-of-the-envelope estimate, just to get a vague sense of what the odds might be like. Someone will come along and do this more carefully, if you like the look of the probabilities (maybe Matt?), and correct my mistakes. But I think I'm in the general ballpark, hopefully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397725/#Comment_397725" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T09:17:54+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  9:17AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 12:00PM by J_Walton.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. My main concern is that soft moves already happen following a player move.<br/><br/>Like: example situation -- an assassin has a knife to your throat and is about to cut you. You roll dice for this not to happen! And you get the result: "soft move." What happens? You failed the roll, kinda, right? Does that mean you suffer the consequences? Maybe not death but "you suffer serious harm, bleeding from a gash on your neck that you've got to keep pressure on; what do you do?" Is that soft enough, given the circumstances? With Act Under Fire and Defy Danger, when you miss your roll you suffer the Fire/Danger. Does this work similarly?<br/><br/>But even if you succeed with flying colors, the GM still makes soft moves, right? Like: "You flip the guy over and have him pinned to the floor, with the knife now at his throat. But [here comes the soft move] the assassin cackles and says: 'No matter. We're coming for you and there's nothing you can do about it.' He spits in your eye; what do you do?"<br/><br/>Two GMs sounds great. Offering power and corruption sounds great too.

The only thing I haven't found is a way to get it to tell me the probability of rolling over a 6 with 2d6 and 1d8 (different die types, basically). But it seems pretty useful for probability purposes, and just playing around with it and looking at graphs, I see what you're talking about. <br/><br/>I think I originally put in 4 tiers of result (Miss, Partial Miss, Partial Success, and Success) because I was reacting (without conscious decision) to that feeling of, "But why would I want more successes than 1 or 2?" What do multiple successes do, here? Perhaps that speaks more to an inherent flaw in the system itself, and I should listen to that annoying voice in me more often. But I won't! Because I'm obstinate!<br/><br/>Anyway, from a more pragmatic standpoint, yeah, there's actually a lot of persuasive arguments here in favor of switching to the 3 tiers of result, with just Miss, Partial Success, and Success. Your probabilistic argument, and Jonathan's arguments above, are all pretty convincing.<br/><br/>Maybe I should think about adding a 3+ "Awesome Success" tier, a la 12+ successes. Hard to get, sure, but if you've sold out your soul to get the resources necessary to achieve one of those, then, by golly, you deserve to be awesome. Before your soul gets eaten.<br/><br/>To answer your questions:\n<blockquote>What do you want the odds to look like in your game?</blockquote>\nI think I like the base grimness of the 3d6 odds with the 3 tiers, as you present them. (3 tiers meaning that the results of significance are No Successes, 1 Success, and 2+ Successes). <br/><br/>Then, I like how things look in terms of the Verb replacing one of the base 3 dice, and then adding in an asset on top. <br/><br/>So that's what I'm leaning towards, maybe: Each verb is a die rating, starting at d6. You roll 2d6 + the verb. Better verbs have higher dice. \n<blockquote>How often do you expect people to roll without calling in any Assets at all?</blockquote>\nNot often. It's there; it's an option, if you're desperate, don't have any assets, or aren't willing to negotiate for a new one. But it's so undesirable, I don't imagine you'd want to do it often.<br/><br/>Of course, as things progress, you're going to get more Brass and Scars. The way I'm currently thinking it is that Brass and Scars are permanent assets for those verbs -- you can add your Brass or Scars score in d6s to any roll that uses a corresponding verb. So after you've beefed up with Brass or Scars, assets might not be necessary anymore, and you might be rolling without them more often.<br/><br/>Of course, by that point, you've sold your soul, but whatever. <br/><br/>Okay, one final point for you, then, Paul. Let me know how this sounds:<br/><br/>"On any roll, you can drop a d6 from the dice pool in order to raise any other die in the pool by one step. D12 is the maximum die size." <br/><br/>Thanks again for all the help, Paul!

Alright, I'ma try to tackle this.\n<blockquote>Like: example situation -- an assassin has a knife to your throat and is about to cut you. You roll dice for this not to happen! And you get the result: "soft move." What happens? You failed the roll, kinda, right? Does that mean you suffer the consequences?

With Act Under Fire and Defy Danger, when you miss your roll you suffer the Fire/Danger. Does this work similarly?</blockquote>\nSo, apologies for being annoying and pedantic, but of course my first question is going to be, "What exactly do you do?" As in, that part where you say " You roll dice for this not to happen!" doesn't tell me much. Are you throwing your head back into the assassin's face? Are you grabbing his wrist and wrenching it away from you? Are you trying to talk the assassin down? All of those are "roll dice for this not to happen," I think. But they're all really, really different in actual play.<br/><br/>Alright, so we'll go with "I throw my head back into the assassin's face, trying to crush his nose with the back of my skull!" Yeah, that's almost certainly the "Break" verb. Roll dice! Soft move. <br/><br/>And in this situation, I am totally seeing some of the disfunctionality you're calling out. In *World, it's a miss, and I'm like, "Yeah, he jerks her head out of the way, and draws the knife across your throat. Take damage!" And then I'm moving on from there, seeing if the PC is still standing, maybe saying, "He then dances back, warily holding his knife at the ready, thinking that someone with a slit throat is going to be an easy target to finish off. What do you do?"<br/><br/>But in my categorization, what I just described is probably a hard move. So, when you rolled soft move, well, that's not appropriate, is it.<br/><br/>Maybe in this case, then, soft move needs to be informed by the verb, "Break". So that's what you were doing, so that's what doesn't happen. So maybe the soft move is, "You jerk your head back, and she moves hers out of the way, but in the process, he loses her hold on you, and his knife slips away from your neck. He's unharmed, but you've got a chance to pull yourself away from him now, without his blade at your throat, if you want. What do you do?" Does that sound okay? Does that work? <br/><br/>Maybe there should be the difference that you suggest: "Soft move" as I use it is, "Suffer the Fire/Danger," where "hard move" as I use it is, "Suffer the Fire/Danger and worse". Maybe. <br/><br/>I can see what you're getting at, and like I said above, it's pretty convincing. I am leaning towards taking out the soft move result. But I'm curious, Jonathan: Does my example above, with the "You're not safe, but you're not harmed; you didn't harm him, but you have a chance for further action" seem satisfactory to you? \n<blockquote>But even if you succeed with flying colors, the GM still makes soft moves, right? Like: "You flip the guy over and have him pinned to the floor, with the knife now at his throat. But [here comes the soft move] the assassin cackles and says: 'No matter. We're coming for you and there's nothing you can do about it.' He spits in your eye; what do you do?"</blockquote>\nYep, you're totally right. I guess the thing is that the soft move in this case, as I'm thinking about it, is flowing from the fiction. No die roll spurred on that soft move, no matter what. The GM is just making that soft move because it's appropriate. Which is fine! Good! That's exactly what I want. That's not gone from what I'm envisioning for this game.<br/><br/>I'm just saying that, as a result of a die roll, the GM might need to make a specifically soft move. This was not me trying to say that this is the ONLY time that there will be soft moves.<br/><br/>I guess another part of the above example that I'm assuming is correct is that the immediate response to the die roll, the success, is the part where you flip the assassin over and have him pinned. And that's a move, too, that represents the successful die roll. Again, the soft move in this example doesn't seem to "follow" the die roll in a causal fashion; the die roll didn't directly cause the soft move. The effects of the die roll (the flip and pin), which <i>were</i> caused by the die roll, then caused the soft move.<br/><br/>So I guess my bottom line is that I actually never even perceived that the above example you provided would even slightly be a problem for my system. But that's easily due to my own ignorance!<br/><br/>Am I not thinking about this correctly, or am I misunderstanding what you're saying? I'd love to hear more! This is really, really interesting for thinking about how to use the *World system to do what I want, so I'm grateful for your comments. \n<blockquote>Two GMs sounds great. Offering power and corruption sounds great too. There are already good precendents for that in the way that Hold and Strings (in MH) work (i.e. spendable resources that can put you in someone else's debt).</blockquote>\nThat's a very interesting point, one that I'll have to put more thought into. Hold, and Strings, and how those touch on what I want to do. Hmmm. Thanks for the idea!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397741/#Comment_397741" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T11:09:04+00:00" title="November 16, 2012 11:09AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan,<br/><br/>I agree with Jonathan about the soft move. That's what I was talking about, too, when I said:\n<blockquote>I think Jonathan's concerns are very valid. Especially the one about the soft move, which also jumped out at me as being a little odd. In particular, if the MC makes a soft move, then you roll to try to avoid the danger... and the result is another soft move... what happens now? Do you just roll again?</blockquote>\n<br/>It sounds like your "one success" result is, basically: the conflict stalls, not progressing one way or the other.<br/><br/>That could work, maybe, but I'm not sure how. It's difficult!<br/><br/>You said:\n<blockquote>Does my example above, with the "You're not safe, but you're not harmed; you didn't harm him, but you have a chance for further action" seem satisfactory to you?</blockquote>\nWell, that's not really a miss, is it? Exactly nothing has changed about the conflict. It's basically, "Ok, you can try again!" Like when you whiff on an attack roll in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be a miss, right? So how does it result in something bad for the character?<br/><br/>The only way I could see it working is if the MC introduced *another* danger. So now you have the guy trying to cut your throat or whatever, but *also* something else bad is happening. <br/><br/>Now you have to choose which thing you're trying to prevent with your next move.<br/><br/>However, that might be *worse* than a hard move. <br/><br/>For instance, let's say the soft move is: "While you're struggling with the assassin, the second assassin runs for the Self-Destruct button. Your left foot is next to a gas canister, you could kick it, rolling it forward to crush the second assassin. What do you do?"<br/><br/>Now you can choose: do I let the assassin slit my throat, and try to prevent the second assassin from reaching the Self-Destruct? Or do I save my own skin first, and let the other guy push the Self-Destruct?<br/><br/>However, now we're looking at, either way:<br/><br/>* A guaranteed bad thing happening (whichever one you choose not to prevent), and<br/>* A chance of a second bad thing happening if you blow your next roll.<br/><br/>That's even worse than a hard move, isn't it? It's like a hard move + a soft move.<br/><br/>So, I'm really not sure how the "soft move on a miss" thing can be handled in play. <br/><br/>Can you try explaining it again?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397746/#Comment_397746" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T11:30:00+00:00" title="November 16, 2012 11:30AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 11:31AM by Paul_T.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm familiar with Anydice, it's a great resource!<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure you can do this:\n<blockquote><br/>output [count 6 in 3d6]<br/>output [count 6 in 2d6] + [count {6,7,8} in 1d8]<br/>output [count 6 in 2d6] + [count {6,7,8,9,10} in 1d10]<br/>output [count 6 in 2d6] + [count {6,7,8,9,10,11,12} in 1d12]<br/></blockquote>\nThere's probably a better way, but I don't know Anydice all that well.<br/><br/>Now, what do you do with the extra successes, if you have them (they'll be pretty rare, as you can see)?<br/><br/>Ideally something connected to the price of using those Assets. Maybe they give one of those GMs some kind of resource they can use to further bribe you. Or they cause you to mutate (gain Brass) right there, on the spot. <br/><br/>Ignoring them isn't that terrible, either.<br/><br/>Finally, your option of upgrading a die size:<br/><br/>What's the goal here? If you tell me what the goal is (other than forcing players to crunch some numbers to figure what to roll), I can try to tell you whether it's a good idea or not.<br/><br/>It's fairly "balanced". (It improves your odds just a tiny bit.) But that begs the question: why bother? If it doesn't change the odds a whole lot (which is what "balanced" would mean), why bother including this option?<br/><br/>If how many dice you're rolling is a really important decision for some reason, then it could be a good thing to include. But it sounds to me like fiddling with a variable that doesn't really change anything.<br/><br/>It's kind of like letting your AW players choose to roll 2d6... or 2d8-2. Well, ok. But is the slight difference worth it? What makes it meaningful? What does it mean for the fiction, what does it means for the player?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397755/#Comment_397755" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T12:10:38+00:00" title="November 16, 2012 12:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brendan, the "soft move" result you narrated is fine, but I agree with Paul that it's not especially interesting. If you want to have results that are basically small shifts in the situation, that's cool, but I guess I tend to expect changes that are more dramatic than that after dice rolls (though in the CoC thread, JD is telling me about small incremental rolls). If not much happens after each roll, you could potentially have a bunch of rolls result in not much changing in the fiction, which leads to things feel more static and less dramatic.<br/><br/>The AW model is:<br/>* you do something significant<br/>* you do it, but there's a cost<br/>* you don't do it and/or suffer the consequences<br/><br/>So, in all cases, something dramatic almost always happens, which drives play forward. If you add a step where you do something, but it's not that significant, or you don't do it, but there's isn't any real cost, I think it waters down the punchiness of the system a bit. You could certainly add other results, but I think they still need to be pretty punchy if you want the game to be thrilling. Like, in Eye on the Door, the middle result gives you a choice: do you go and pay the price, or do you stay in order to not pay the price? Very dramatic! And a somewhat different result. There are other possibilities along those lines too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397762/#Comment_397762" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T13:12:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  1:12PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2012 1:14PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point, Jonathan!<br/><br/>Maybe including player choice into the mechanic would allow some kind of solution. For instance, you can allow the MC to make hard move... OR something else, which escalates the stakes of the situation.<br/><br/>It's not obvious to me how to handle this in an AW framework, though.<br/><br/>Edit: It could work if it interacts in an interesting way with the Assets (or a similar sub-system). So, you can suck up the hard move, OR you can try again, but you must accept some kind of help from one of the two GMs (and make it some kind of help you don't want!). So maybe you end up doubling your chances of losing your humanity right on the spot, and you get to roll again.<br/><br/>Something like that could work, perhaps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398208/#Comment_398208" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T12:11:40+00:00" title="November 20, 2012 12:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like others have basically done my work for me...
