It's a game inspired by the thematic dynamics of the video game Silent Hill 2.  This is my current introduction for the game.<br/><br/>"Silent Sound is a surreal horror game about confronting personal guilt.  The game is designed to produce stories about characters that harbor guilt for some key, life changing action they have taken in the past.  The characters are drawn to a surreal and frightening town named Silent Sound by a lure that offers them the promise of absolution,.  Through out their journey they will be confronted with the symbols, messages and demons of their own troubled mind given external frightening form.  In the end they will find either absolution or damnation."<br/><br/>I have recently completed a ground up rewrite of the game.  The previous form and idea of the game just wasn't working.  A big thanks goes to Christopher Kubasik for helping me realize that my game has more in common with lyric poetry than dramatic narrative.  The game is structured somewhat like a dungeon crawl through the character's emotional landscape and memories.  It's a little like Dante's Inferno meets Walden.<br/><br/>It can be found here: <a href="http://bloodthornpress.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/silent_sound.pdf" rel="nofollow">Silent Sound</a><br/><br/>The document is very bare bones.  I consider it procedurally complete in that it tells you everything you need to know to play the game but contains no advice or strategy beyond raw procedures.  As always I welcome feedback.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264147/#Comment_264147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T08:43:51+00:00" title="March 26, 2010  8:43AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this a lot. I found Silent Hill 2 a bit pokey and artificially elongated as a gameplay experience, but the fundamental conceit of the game is rich with possibilities that I'd never considered until I read your doc. Well done!<br/><br/>One thing that concerns me is that I think a lot of suspense that would naturally arise from gameplay would be deflated if the player already knew all of the rules you've published here. Usually (with the obvious exception of <i>Paranoia</i>) I have no time for games that actively attempt to keep players ignorant of the rules, but I think that your game is crying out for such a treatment. So when you re-write, I'd try to make it a bit clearter which of the rules the player should know and which should be kept hidden.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_264166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264166/#Comment_264166" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-26T11:26:08+00:00" title="March 26, 2010 11:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks for the encouragement.  The game's premise is a really hard sell.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure I would want to keep *rules* hidden from the players.  I'm actually totally okay if players want to game the little die trading system.<br/><br/>However, one idea I'm toying with is keeping the crimes hidden from the other Condemned.  Only The Shadow and The Voice of Reason would know the crimes.<br/><br/>One of my absolute favorite moments from the game is a moment about 3/4th of way through where I (don't know if others had the same experience) finally realized what the hell was going on.  And what was cool about it was that the game still hadn't actually told me.  It was the WAY James reacted to something that made me go, "OH MY GOD!" and then every bloody creepy symbol in the game all suddenly came into alignment at once.<br/><br/>I had long ago decided that trying to re-capture that experience would probably be too difficult in a live environment.  But I'm thinking that this setup MIGHT give me a shot at it.  I just don't want the other Condemned players to be bored.  I don't know if the weirdness would just be un-engaging if you didn't know what it was tied to.  The video game at least kept you busy with shooting monsters while you worked out what the hell this was all about.  But there MIGHT be fun in, "A soda can!?  What the hell does a Soda Can have to do with the graffiti he saw in the LAST room?"<br/><br/>I'm even toying with the idea of keeping the crime PARTIALLY hidden from The Voice of Reason.  In the first location The Voice of Reason would only know who the victim was.  In the second location The Voice of Reason would be told what the motive was.  Only in the third location would The Voice of Reason be told the whole crime.<br/><br/>But I think I want to play test it as is before adding those twists.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264611/#Comment_264611" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-31T00:46:05+00:00" title="March 31, 2010 12:46AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2010 12:57PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure I could run it from what you've got here, Jesse.
