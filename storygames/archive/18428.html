And though I would argue that the need to work at it a bit is actually what creates a good, proactive player, I realize that there may be other games that work better for different audiences. So what other games have you found are really good for teaching players how to drive (as opposed to just being along for the ride)?<br/><br/>(If the answer is: "That's every story game you idiot," feel free to just say that.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415120/#Comment_415120" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T08:16:02+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  8:16AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu - every moment of play is either riffing on your character, or listening to another player (including the GM) riff on theirs.

The Principle of Narrative Truth will do that. "Yes, just say it. Yes, you can do that before you roll. No, you don't need to ask."<br/><br/>In a similar vein, John Wick's Houses of the Blooded and Blood &amp; Honor have a neat "wagers" system that acts similarly. You earn "wagers" that give you the power to make things happen in the game. It's like a back-loaded Wushu. So when a player says "what clues do I find?" on a successful roll, you tell them "you get to tell me what clues you find...and what they mean".<br/><br/>The *World games are nice, in that they give the players concrete assurances for the actions they can take.

Separately, I love throwing this game at long-standing traditional GMs. It simultaneously reinforces and breaks their assumptions about games and it's really fun to watch that <i>Eureka!</i> moment happen sometime around the end of Spring/beginning of Summer.\n<blockquote>The *World games are nice, in that they give the players concrete assurances for the actions they can take. That makes them more comfortable with taking actions, I think.</blockquote>\nI get what you're saying, but I'll push back on that a little. It gives them concrete assurances for actions they can take, but if you don't use the moves that give you narrative control over the fiction, you don't get the feedback that you have it. For example, I've run AW about a half dozen times (which I realize is a very small sample, so YMMV), always with new players. I've never had anyone open their mind to the psychic maelstrom on a whim, which (imho) is probably the purest way to take creative control. When I'm playing in an AW game, whenever I'm a little stuck on what to do, I open my brain. Especially if there are new players. It's a technique I learned from Burning Wheel: if you don't know what to do, push forward and do something really dumb; there's almost always fun around that corner.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415136/#Comment_415136" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T09:58:42+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  9:58AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say Lady Blackbird, InSpectres, Bad Family and This Is Pulp.

I remember the first time I ran Apocalypse World. I was only familiar with running Burning Wheel at that point and without player Beliefs to drive the beats I was grasping at straws at first, but the First Session rules helped a lot. I asked a lot of pointed questions that were filled with ambiguity. I wrote down the answers (and tried to tie them to the things on that sheet, but fuck if I knew whether I was doing it right) and referenced them in questions to other players, sometimes going back to a previous player to ask clarifying questions. I did a lot wrong in that first run, but several players said they really liked the questions I asked. I realize now that the reason that they liked them wasn't because I'm awesome at coming up with questions, but because it gave them agency from the start. <br/><br/>So hey, maybe this is a GM-advice thing after all? That hurts my system-matters-oriented brain a lot, but I like the idea that you can teach player agency with nearly any game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415155/#Comment_415155" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T12:14:38+00:00" title="May 31, 2013 12:14PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll second Rickard. InSpetres is a game that subtly gives the player great agency/proactivity. The trick is that when the players (as opposed to the GM) are on the line for adding new narration to the narrative, there is a tone of context and some constraint (You did X, you rolled a 6 so describe how X is amazing for your franchise). When I want players to learn this skill without beating them over the head with it, this is my go-to game. Other games do this, but require more GM-type skills than most. For instance, Wushu is a great way to exercise this skill. but if you don't have the skill already, it is not great at helping develop it.

GMless games like Fiasco and 1001 Nights do work to put players into a role of throwing out challenges.  (It's possible to avoid GM-like actions in these, but you have to work to avoid it.)  This isn't exactly the same as proactivity in my mind, though.  <br/><br/>Some games do have the players make things up - but they aren't especially proactive.  For example, Dogs in the Vineyard or The Mountain Witch have the PCs being explicitly reactive to an external problem.  <br/><br/>For my mind, one of the best games for proactivity is Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks.  The key for that is that in the setting and situation.  In most setups, the characters want to reduce chaos and trouble.  Heroes usually fight crime and otherwise restore the status quo.  Villains want to gain for themselves, but they want their plans to go smoothly.  In H&amp;H, though, it's easy to get into the mindset of a character who genuinely wants <b>trouble</b>.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415191/#Comment_415191" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T15:32:08+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  3:32PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't understand why that's considered proactivity instead of bold, aggressive character action.</blockquote>\nWhat's the distinction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415199/#Comment_415199" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-31T17:07:51+00:00" title="May 31, 2013  5:07PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can be a reactive, cautious GM.

I would say better than FATE and Lady Blackbird (even though I would gladly play either of those games in a heart beat over D&amp;D). <br/><br/>1 - FATE and LB rely on players who want to jump into the story and are comfortable doing so. Seems to me, those would be players that don't need to be coached. D&amp;D emphasizes departmentalization: everyone has a role to play, and that role has a big impact on the game and the effectiveness of the group as a whole.<br/><br/>2 - FATE and LB are much more fluid, again, requiring familiarity with rpg's and a high comfort level in going with the flow. D&amp;D is segmented; now it's your turn, what is your action; now (X) happens, what do you do? It's like training wheels. This is part A, now move to part B, etc.<br/><br/>The thing that I see is that players get stuck there and don't move on to games that I think are more engaging. That's fine, if that's what they want.

I'll give you an example. In Burning Wheel, there is an attribute (and game mechanic) called Circles. Now, Burning Wheel has a lot of mechanisms for player to affect the narrative, but this is perhaps the most subtle and most powerful - you can invent an NPC based on your past to help you out. But even after I explain that... people don't think to use it. I have to wait until someone really gets in a bind and then say "Hey, wouldn't it be nice if a friend from your past came along and helped you out? Oh, yes. You can do that."

But I'm not actually a fan of fantasy as a genre: I've read some of the books, but swords and dragons and all that stuff doesn't really resonate with me, and consequently, I was never, ever going to <i>want</i> any level of authorship over those games. The fuck do I care, right? Hell, just coming up with names for fantasy characters sometimes seemed like too much of a chore.<br/><br/>It wasn't until I got to play non-fantasy RPGs that I started taking an interest in doing more than just answering "What do you do next?" I could get into science fiction settings, I could get into Westerns, I could get into modern settings, I could get into...well, lots of things that I was already into, when it comes right down to it. I had a deeper understanding of and interest in those kinds of settings already, and finding ways to use that knowledge and interest proactively just seemed to be a natural step to take, even though I don't think the systems we were using actually made any specific attempt to encourage that kind of thing.<br/><br/>So that's my advice on how to teach player agency/proactivity: whatever game you run, make sure it's set somewhere the players already know and like. Whether that's a specific setting like Star Wars or the Marvel superhero universe, or a genre like spy thrillers or epic fantasy: make sure the core elements of the story are already totally one of their areas of expertise. The confidence you get from knowing how things are done in a setting is a huge, huge part of what makes you actually <i>do things</i> there, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission" title="EndTransmission"><img alt="EndTransmission" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/428/nBVTR0D284U65.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EndTransmission">EndTransmission</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415639/#Comment_415639" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T19:19:57+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  7:19PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not sure if this is the kind of thing a game can necessarily teach...I've run tons of games of different groups for my group and they tend to be incredibly reactive, in spite of my encouragement to be proactive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415664/#Comment_415664" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T09:21:39+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  9:21AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this a group you've been playing with a long time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415681/#Comment_415681" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-07T13:43:54+00:00" title="June  7, 2013  1:43PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2013 1:44PM by Mcdaldno.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games can definitely teach agency and proactivity.<br/><br/>Jackson Tegu's game Temper reminds you that your emotions might be self-directed, but your response to them is chosen, and you can choose differently.<br/><br/>Dog Eat Dog raises consciousness around processes of colonialism and assimilation, and illuminates the different ways that resistance and self-protection can emerge.
