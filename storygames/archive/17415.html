If I don\u2019t have notes on what happens in a game I tend to lose things, characters names, the personalities of minor npcs, and most importantly, the decisions that characters make regarding each other and the situation at large. <br/><br/>So I take copious notes. When I\u2019m a player I can generally manage to take notes on what is going on and play, but when I\u2019m MC I cannot take notes and keep all the plates spinning. My solution for this has been to record my sessions and then go back and transcribe my notes from the recording. This works really well, but it takes a lot of time and energy, even when I\u2019m running only a single session a week. It often takes me as long to record my notes as it does to play the game. <br/><br/>I use these notes to do comprehensive recaps the next session, which my players (and my gm\u2019s when I do this in games I\u2019m playing) find very helpful, but it can get exhausting.  So how does everyone else handle this? Do you take notes? How many notes do you take? How do you take them while playing?<br/><br/>As a side note: this has only really become serious problem for me since I switched to playing a lot of games derived from Apocalypse World. The length of the sessions I play hasn\u2019t changed, the sessions I play still contain between 2.25h and 2.75h of game time spread out over 3.5h of chronological time, but the amount of note-worthy events per session has gone way up. <br/><br/>My notes from a Fate 3.0 game I was playing last year would be between 0.75 of a page and 1.5 pages per session. I found this amount of notes fairly easy to handle, but the session of Monsterhearts I just transcribed was 2.25h long and had seven and a half pages of notes.<br/><br/>Have you found that certain games require additional notes or produce more \u201cnote-worthy events\u201d per hour of play?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394328/#Comment_394328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T13:17:12+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  1:17PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really curious to hear what people have to say about this as my AW games starts on Friday.<br/><br/>When I play I always have note paper in front of me, but I'm kind of spotty about taking notes.  Some sessions I do well and get lots of relevant details which help me remember what's going on when we start up again.  Other times, I look back and I have a date and nothing else.<br/><br/>When I GM, it's worse, I think.  I guess I'm okay about at least noting names, but I don't naturally keep up notes during play and I find it difficult to go back after the session and make notes on what happened.  For AW, I may have to figure this out, I think.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394329/#Comment_394329" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T13:18:56+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  1:18PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good topic +1!

For the first season, I also used to record our sessions and transcribe them later. (I'd include a link to the write-ups, but my Web host and I are currently at war and my site isn't available right now.) <br/><br/>As JackFractal notes, the transcription process was a significant undertaking in time and effort. But there were huge pay-offs. The notes were complete enough to be a springboard for future adventures, which led to frequent reincorporation, which further led to making the game universe feel very much alive and organic. In my mind, the <i>piece de resistance</i> was when the Big Bad was defeated in the finale, Episode 13, with an item that had been found by the players way back in Episode 2, but which they'd practically forgotten. Without the recordings, I never would have remembered the thing found in Episode 2, and how it could be used to bring about the Big Bad's undoing.<br/><br/>By the second season, though, I had run out of steam. I still recorded the sessions, but I never got around to writing them up. The effect was profound. The second season was episodic rather than epic. Despite having a story arc, each session felt disjointed, like a monster-of-the-week episode, even though the monsters were recurring.<br/><br/>I've recently started a Monster of the Week campaign (Mike Sands' AW hack), and I just can't seem to keep my facts straight from session to session. Maybe I'm just getting old, but this game system really does seem to produce more to remember. And either I can't find my notes -- pathetic as they are -- when I need them, or I realize I forgot to jot something down in the first place.<br/><br/>I need a secretary. <br/><br/>I know a GM who used to award experience points to any of his players who kept an in-character journal. Cool idea, but it wouldn't work with my crew.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394388/#Comment_394388" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T19:59:22+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  7:59PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Dirty Secrets, the Investigator has a notebook, but there aren't any mechanics associated with it.

Mostly that's names: one minute after hearing a name, I've probably already forgotten it. Putting down the names of the characters I'm interacting with along with a short bit of context (like "coroner" or "wyvern hunter" or whatever) means that I'll be able to talk to or about that character later on without feeling like an inconsiderate dumbass. And I keep a little to-do list going that I update during the game and especially at the end, so that I'll be able to pick up where we left off next game and won't accidentally stop pursuing something interesting just because I got distracted by a shiny object.<br/><br/>And that's as much as I'll bother with these days, unless it's an investigation-heavy game. For those, I supplement the above with a bare-bones collection of phrases and arrows to sum up where we went and what we learned and where that took us next, including whatever conclusions we drew from it or theories we developed. It's insanely useful. (Even more so because a lot of my friends will lose track of what exactly we were trying to accomplish, and being able to explain to them exactly why and how we got where we are makes me feel helpful.)<br/><br/><br/>As a GM, most of the notes I take during the game are names, again. What's the name of the person they just talked to, and what did they talk about? I also make a note if the players do something that gives me an idea for what might happen next (or something that <i>should</i> give me an idea, even if I don't actually have one yet). At the end of the night I jot down what they're planning on doing next time, as well as making sure that I've got all the new names down and set apart with little stars or boxes, and seeing if any of those ideas I had are things I'd want to pull forward into the next session.<br/><br/>The big thing for me is to look over those in-game notes again within two days. That way, my memory is still fresh enough that I'll understand what I wrote, but I'll also have enough distance to be able to get a different perspective on what I thought was so important I needed to write it down. I don't need to do anything in particular with the notes, just read 'em and think about the game. It takes maybe five to fifteen minutes, if that much.<br/><br/>The serious note-taking happens when I'm prepping for running a game. That's when I start writing all kinds of stuff down. I'll update my character list and make sure I have enough random names on my list to be able to assign one to any NPC that shows up. I'll make a list of things I might want to have happen in the upcoming session, and brainstorm some details for each of them. I'll work out how some NPCs will react to what happened last time, how other NPCs will act this time, and what might be happening "off-screen" that the PCs might uncover. If it's a game with combat scenes and I think a fight might happen, I'll put all the necessary enemy stats and abilities in one place so I don't have to flip through books. Basically, my prep notes include anything that I might find myself wanting to have in the heat of the moment but I wouldn't want to have to actually MAKE in the heat of the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394408/#Comment_394408" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T02:48:24+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  2:48AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My notes are a name list and a relationship map like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.gnomestew.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/fish-3.png"/><br/><br/>I just add notes while we play if I have to improvise a NPC or if the players' ideas on how the factions are connected are more interesting than on my relationship map.

I tend to write while other players are taking the limelight. It's pretty much just a stream of what happened. I keep right hand pages of the journal for note taking and left hand pages for really important things that I'll want to get back to quickly (names, sketch maps, lists, that sort of thing.) In some games I'll do AP reports (in a Buffy game I turn the notes in to an in-character journal) but it's a how I feel from game to game thing. It's proved very useful for answering the 'who did what', 'who was that?', 'what did we do there?' type questions a number of sessions later on. With the Buffy I had an ongoing list of 'things we think are worth investigating but don't have answers to yet' I'd share that with the GM to give him a heads up on what directions we might be heading in next.<br/><br/>As a GM I have notes before the game, again the intensity varies, I'll try and have stats for anything that needs stats if it's that sort of game. I'll have a list of appropraite names so when an NPC appears I can name them, cross it off the list and add it to my notes. I try and jot down important things while the PC's are bickering among themselves but again it depends on how the session is running. It is very much sketchy notes and I'll do a lot more drawing links/arrows/circling or underlining as a shorthand when I'm in the GM seat. For me the act of writing something helps to lock it in my memory (it's my learning method) so I don't necessarily need to know why I wrote something to get the context of the time I wrote it. The one thing I make sure to do is have a list of who is where, doing what, and what the current plan is (if any) when it comes to session end. Both so I can plan for what to do next session and to start next session with something to remind the players what they were thinking of doing so it's not wasted. I almost never AP a game I've run unless doing so will directly help someone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394429/#Comment_394429" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T07:38:30+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  7:38AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am horrible about this as a GM, so I have tried to hand it off to the players for some in game rewards. <br/><br/>That did not go over well.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394432/#Comment_394432" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T08:04:18+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  8:04AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2012 8:05AM by Fuseboy.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For face-to-face sessions, I've made myself a form.  There are two columns for me to write bullet points of what happens in the session, and then there are a couple of other boxes: one has my planned bangs that I'm waiting for the right time to deploy, and the other is where I write down anything that demands reintroduction later.  (e.g. players shoot sheriff, that's where I write down that the deputy comes looking for them).<br/><br/>I have a separate sheet for the PCs' beliefs, which I've transformed into imperatives.  If a Skrab has, "Never let an insult go unanswered," for example, I write down, "Insult Skrab."<br/><br/>Another sheet (or three) contains my notes for specific NPCs.<br/><br/><br/>When I play on Skype, it's much the same, but I use a Tiddlywiki.  The session notes go into one tiddler, my upcoming bangs are in another, kept below it so they're close together, and each NPC or location of note gets its own tiddler.  I have a "Reintroduction" tiddler containing things I'd like to get to but aren't immediately urgent.<br/><br/>In either case, I find it extremely helpful to write up the session afterwards to share as an AP, that really crystallizes my memory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394433/#Comment_394433" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T08:07:07+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  8:07AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2012 8:08AM by w00hoo.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That did not go over well. </blockquote>\nOut of interest, why not?

A box might represent an abandoned warehouse, a weird stick figure could represent the cripple who lives on the roof, later when the whole thing burns down our scribbly flames and smoke remind us of what happened.<br/><br/>The purpose of note-taking, in my mind is not to have a verbatim record of what is happening in the story (that is what audio recording is for) but to serve as an at the table reminder for what has been established in the fiction. We want to remember these things so we can <b>reincorporate</b> them back into the fiction. With this in mind, I think that less is more.

Aside from anything else it shares the responsibility to create things around the table. Something happens that needs recording, draw it on the map.<br/><br/>How notes are taken, and if they are required at all, is very much a function of what game is being played. Some will survive happily with a small amount of note taking, others will need something a lot more complicated. AW strikes me as something (read it, not managed to play it yet) that doesn't have the huge amount of information that requires an in depth set of notes. The problems happen to a compact number of PC's and NPC's and they resolve to create new problems that are at the forefront of the players memories.

I certainly noticed that I was able to recall a lot more at the table, though, and my players commented that with the countdowns right there in my face, the game proceeded quicker and was more awesome, so at least some of it is working!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394619/#Comment_394619" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T10:52:11+00:00" title="October 24, 2012 10:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually (effectively) taking notes in my Dungeon Girls and Dungeon Kids games by taking some blogging time to recount the sessions.

But it occurs to me that it's not a bad benchmark for how to keep track of a campaign.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about using Evernote or Popplet as tools for tracking my Other Worlds 1492 game, which is going through a reboot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394652/#Comment_394652" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T13:04:29+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  1:04PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to favor one-shots or relatively short multi-session games such as <i>Grey Ranks</i> or <i>The Mountain Witch</i>.

Initially, I also had a separate sheet for a list of all NPCs in the game, but it soon enough fell into disuse, as maintenance of it became a distraction from actually MCing \u2014 most NPCs didn't stay around (or survive) long enough for me to forget about them, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394749/#Comment_394749" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-25T08:05:26+00:00" title="October 25, 2012  8:05AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>In either case, I find it extremely helpful to write up the session afterwards to share as an AP, that really crystallizes my memory.</blockquote>\nDoesn't that take a really long time?

I don't do it often for face-to-face games, but for Skype gaming, I find that once the session is over, I'm still wired and as I'm already at the computer, it's easy just to roll into an AP.
