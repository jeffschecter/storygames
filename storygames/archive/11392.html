Just personal accounts, aphorisms etc of what helps (works) for you in the internet, on gaming forums, on This Forum, and so on. Think of it as a Lifehacker/personal productivity suggestions thread. A buffet of advice might give folks some folks items to pick and choose from.<br/><br/>To get started, I'll pull some bits from the other thread to get the ball rolling:<br/><br/>Colin C says:<br/>I<b>consider the internet as a placeholder for face-to-face interaction, not a substitute...<br/>...If direct engagement doesn't work, ignore them. Either by choice (which is what I do), or by mechanical means (as Jason discussed).</b><br/><br/>Ryan Macklin tackles the psychological processes at work:<br/><b>That that taught me is that such asshattery is actually a necessary (or, at least, inseparable) component of internet community growth. That might require a longer post to unpack.<br/><br/>My gut tells me that it involves attempting to fulfill a reward cycle in our brains -- when we're in the midst of internet hate, we talk about it in order to achieve some form of closure. "Someone is wrong on the internet! I am compelled to close off this reward cycle by making them know!" And that can mean making a conversation more public, thus the linking private &amp; public.</b><br/><br/>Jesse really got the ball rolling with solid, pragmatic advice in his post:\n<blockquote>...Of course I tend to avoid the [FORUMS] that get boring for me, or are not relevant to my interests. I do think I simply get bored at a lot of back and forth sniping... Even the most savvy of us don't realize how we come across in print or in real life, and it's a cold splash of water when someone has the guts to let us know. <br/><br/>I think there are three things that anyone can do to make communication (here, and in real life) more pleasant.<br/><br/>1. If someone makes you feel bad, let them know.<br/>2. Be polite about it.<br/>3. Make amends whenever possible.<br/><br/>I would also say to avoid subjects that make you upset, but that's impossible to know. In light of that, I'd say avoid subjects that seem boring to you. I can only think of negative things when I'm dealing with stuff I don't care about.</blockquote>\nElizabeth talks about the idea of social currency as attention and good feeling, with the perhaps sub-assumption that it's better to seek it through being pleasant than not pleasant, but the not-pleasant route being the fastest way to get it (the classic Dark Jedi scenario)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>My friend Liam once said that the decline of forum etiquette is based on social currency. When a forum begins, you get social currency (attention OR good feelings) by posting thoughtful and insightful things. But the moment someone gains social currency by being unpleasant, it erodes the community. Because-- even if you try to only get social currency by being thoughtful and insightful-- everyone knows, deep down, the easier path to social currency is to be loud or unpleasant. That knowledge makes it more difficult to back down when someone else is a jerk, or resist being clever at someone else's expense. A community, as a whole, will always slowly gravitate towards the easiest way to get social currency. That's entropy at work.</blockquote>\nRyan M reminds us that the people that ARE here are not always the people who POST here:<br/><b>I do like what you have to say here. The only thing I would add to this thread overall is: Do not forget that [number of people reading an S-G thread] &gt; [number of people posting on it]. It's easy to look at a community and consider it based on its posters. Meeting forum lurkers at mini-con &amp; indie-con events tends to restore my faith in the community at large.</b><br/><br/>Bret posts a vignette that's really close to my heart for reasons I won't get into here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>My friend Liam once said that the decline of forum etiquette is based on social currency.

Concrete real world examples. "Actual play" or whatever.<br/><br/>There was a time when I got involved in discussions in Buddhist forums a lot. The same kind of stuff happened there that happens everywhere, dogpiling, name-calling, etc. So whenever someone tried to pick a fight with me or got aggressively disagreeable, I would just relate what I was talking about to a story about me. Back my stuff up with my experiences. That did wonders at making the conversations more human, defusing them, and often I would get back a story about why they felt the way they feel.</blockquote>\nWundergeek/Anna brings it back to reality, telling us that the ways we approach conflict resolution in real life don't match the internet:<br/><b>Okay, so the problem with using conflict resolution tactics from real life is that conversations on the internet do NOT function like those in real life. They just don't. People who are in real life very pleasant and agreeable people will behave deplorably on the internet</b><br/><br/>(cont)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253594/#Comment_253594" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T18:34:55+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  6:34PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2010 6:39PM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wordman (Lester) dropped a solid stretegy guide here which I would like to make the template for posting your own suggestions:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>About 10 years ago, I (mostly accidentally) started following a specific strategy when someone would disagree with a post I made in a forum. It's made using forums more pleasant, at least from my point of view. On the minus side, it can be hard to do. On the plus side, it is an approach that is entirely in your hands and doesn't rely on changing other people's behavior (which isn't your job). Works like this:<br/><br/>1) When confronted by a post that disagrees with what you are saying (regardless of the tone of that disagreement), make the assumption that the reason for the disagreement is that<i>your original post didn't actually say what you meant it to say</i>. That is, the person is disagreeing because they didn't understand what you are saying and this is not because they are stupid, but because your writing sucks.<br/><br/>2) Regardless if there is evidence to support the assumption that you are being misunderstood or not, or even if the idea of it doesn't even make any sense to you,<i>proceed as if this assumption is true</i>, even if you are sure it isn't. Clarify the point you are making, totally ignoring any inflammatory stuff that may or may not have been in the reply. Use an example if you can.<br/><br/>3) Repeat until any misunderstanding is cleared up or you are convinced that the person really does disagree with you. All the while, be just as polite as can be, even in the face of asshattery.<br/><br/>4) Once you reach this point, the other person has heard what you have to say. You've heard what he's had to say. You disagree. So, most important point: now you're done. There is no further need to pay attention to this person in this matter or belabor the point. You will not convince him. He will not convince you. Just move on, without any further explanation or comment at all. If you are continuing in the thread talking to<i>other</i>readers, feel free to read the disagreeing guy's posts, but make no response to them, or even recognition that they were made.<br/><br/>That's it. Now, when you read it said like that, it seems really stupid.<br/><br/>But damned if it doesn't work.<br/><br/>If enough people in a forum take this (or a similar) approach, the net effect usually turns out to prevent the "social currency from being a douchebag" from being gained, or even perceived. I'm not sure why this happens, but it's been the case more often than not.</blockquote>\nC Edwards had some similar thoughts:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C. Edwards</cite>Don't know if I would call this a strategy but here goes...<br/><br/>Since I know that it's impossible to punch somebody through the internet I know that engaging in any escalation of behavior that is out of line will ultimately be frustrating and unsatisfying. Maybe that's a crude way to look at it, but hey, it keeps me civil in online discourse.<br/><br/>Well, I generally hold politeness and manners in very high regard anyway, which makes my hot button not a particular topic but the actual manner of posting. So for the most part, the only thing that is going to make me want to punch somebody (or anything leading up to it) is blatant rudeness and basic disrespect.<br/><br/>The problem with that is anybody engaging in those behaviors is usually doing it with malicious purpose. They also know that nobody can punch them through the internet and are happy to take advantage of it. What was it R.E.H. had Conan say? Something about civilized men having the worst manners because they know they're not a second away from having their skulls split open.<br/><br/>It's all just a basic animal behavior issue for me cross-referenced with a simple cost/benefit analysis. You can't win an argument on the internet. If you're arguing you've already lost. The only thing anyone will remember without Googling the discussion is that you lost your head and acted like a jerk. And without the option of maximum escalation any vitriol exchanged will be ultimately fruitless and undecisive (plus frustrating and unsatisfying).<br/><br/>Issues of rudeness and disrespect are never defused by fighting fire with fire anyway (you either escalate, which we've noted isn't possible, or you maintain your copacetic). The person slinging them at you probably wants you to get riled and upset. That's sort of the point. So don't do it.</blockquote>\nBret drops a funny:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Concrete action: when confronted with ugly threads, press<a href="http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/" rel="nofollow">this button</a>.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I prefer <a href="http://khaaan.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>http://khaaan.com/</b></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253603/#Comment_253603" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T19:38:03+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  7:38PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2010 7:40PM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wordman's responses are pretty much identical to my own in terms of mitigating conflict with another person. Heck, I have friends on LJ where I "ignore" all their posts because I can't stand their political rants or somesuch, but still consider them friends in real life. <br/><br/>Here are some other strategies I've adopted, both as a poster and even a moderator:<br/><br/><b>* Treat correspondences like Workplace Communications</b>: I work somewhere between 45-60 hours a week with Fortune 100 companies, government agencies, and so on. It was only very recently that I realized my tone here over the past year or two (as my workload, and "integration" into work increased) has been moving closer to the way I communicate through work emails and forums: Pragmatic, direct, creating no friction... sure I drop more swears and jokes and stuff, but I guess work has poisoned me to that regard: It's very hard for me to break down these days into a total meltdown, or heap fire onto an oily problem without looking ahead and seeing that I'll just be causing more harm than good. And I try to never "air dirty laundry".<br/><br/>This causes me to not reply to some threads or topics, even when addressed directly, but hey: At the end of the day, constructive behavior just feels better than destructive. I often whisper further in private or email if I think the conversation should really continue.<br/><br/>So maybe "pretending you're at work" will help others as well, I dunno.<br/><br/><b>* <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TL4XZdyo3g" rel="nofollow">Just Walk Away</a> for a while</b>: If something here makes me "hurt" or emotional, instead of responding, I'll sometimes just say to myself, "I don't want to deal with this". So I walk away: I go to the gym for an hour or so. I dive back into work. I watch some J-Dramas or read a book or play a video game and totally ignore whatever was happening here.<br/><br/>When I return, the following usually happens:<br/>-- I forgot why I was so angry, and just get on with things.<br/>-- I am much more rational and can post without being all tied up inside.<br/>-- I realize that I didn't really care that much about what was happening anyway.<br/>-- I realize the ratio of "time it would take to carefully lay out my position so the other person gets it" is overshadowed by "amount I now give a shit", and just rant to a buddy over email or face to face or something.<br/><br/><b>* Utilize IM and email to hit up my friends to laugh at stupid shit I see:</b> Sometimes we Just Need a Stress Release moment, and doing so over IM or phone is so much more cathartic and constructive for me than dropping bombs publicly.<br/><br/><b>* If I have the time, I try to work out a pragmatic or constructive thread I've been milling on for a while:</b> I ask people "whatcha playing these days, and how's it going?" in order to get enthused about my hobby again. I ask folks about their recent fun/cool experiences. I ask to see what folks have been working on to make their games better. The kind of stuff that reminds me that this is fundamentally a site devoted to one hobby, and with the clear effect of making me enthused to be a part of that hobby. Judd has (or maybe Had, I think he kinda got tired of doing it, or maybe it's because others picked up the slack and made their own such threads) his "Githyanki Therapy Threads", as the Githyanki was his favorite monster/NPC race from classic D&amp;D, and would talk about them for a bit. Mine would be something like Dark Sun or TORG, but instead I like to go straight to the vein with game-play-centric threads.<br/><br/><b>* I don't hold grudges</b>, although it's hard sometimes. I've seen three flareups in about a year happen here because of some bad blood on another site that rhymes with Wife Light. Heck, I had a rivalry from there, too, that ended up poisoning me a bit inside until I let it go. Just gotta learn to leave your burdens and grudges at the door, or they really will mess you up. That's general advice, but man it works well.<br/><br/>* And heck, I sometimes <b>apply some good advice simply from being married</b> for so long: Learning to apologize or empathize even when you're damned sure you're in the right, keeping a door open to make amends, and so on. You will never meet half these people you talk to, but if you do it can be very embarrassing. And even if you don't ever meet them, this will help ease up those burdensome grudges. As I like to tell people, the first thing Clinton ever said to me, ever, on the Internet was "FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE!" Cut to 5 years later and he's living with me for a bit in NC and we're playing at the same table. Never would have happened if we were the kinds to hold grudges or refuse to give people the benefit of the doubt.<br/>But hey, the relationship thing helps. I was joking with Gaerik (Andrew C) when I met him for the first time that the stuff we learned through trial and error through marriage carried over to various internet forums: "You can <i>be right</i> all the time, or you can <i>be married</i>. Choose one." (we both have strong, fierce and honestly sometimes a little frightening asian wives). Applicable to being a member of a community.<br/><br/>* It was said above by Wordman, but <b>give people the benefit of the doubt</b>: If you're reading something in to something they didn't explicitly say, that means that you yourself put it there. Is that helpful, to you or to them? Sometimes (it's how the mind works), but it often just leads to more pain. I have to remind myself of that too when I read something and immediately think poorly of them for some reason or other, because they did something sometime in the past or whatever. I guess this bit is easier for me, because I'm kind of an optimist, but it did take practice, it's not as simple as Wishing I could see the world through rose-color glasses: I had to work at not immediately jumping to shitty conclusions about people.<br/><br/><b>* Jump into other threads</b>:This goes along with creating a new topic. A common phrase used here by folks I like is "Be the change you want to see". However, sometimes a flare-up happens when you're really tired and don't have the energy to post some new long topic. Then pop open a thread or two that you read and tell people what you thought of their idea in a sentence or two, even in private. It can't hurt, and it's easier than coming up with a new topic idea if you're strapped for ideas, or you lurk more than post, or you just don't feel that you have enough interest to create a new post.<br/>--These days, I also head over to Praxis or The Forge to read and comment on some threads over there to blow off some steam in a productive manner.<br/><br/><b>* Walk away from the forums entirely</b>: I'm the "moderator"* and I disappear for a day, a week, even two weeks when I get stressed, caught up in work, bored, jaded, and so on. It takes very little to catch up to threads with interesting titles on the first 1-2 pages when I return (this is why I'm thankful for the low user count and slow post/topic turnover: I can't ever do this at RPGNet, and that saddens me). The idea of "biorythm" is scientifically hokey, but holy shit from my side of the screen I've seen how people and even entire forums/communities have high points and low points that happen and flow regularly, just like the concept of biorythms. It's why we see community crisis of conscience threads, hugs/get-well threads every 3-4 months like clockwork, periods of slow or dull activity, periods of energetic rushes that don't necessarily correspond to Con Seasons, and so on. Knowing that These Things Happen has made it easy to walk away and come back fresh.<br/>(I use the quotes because active moderators on popular discussion sites would look at the amount of time I spend actually performing acts of public moderation and "LOL"; truth is I do very little moderation and the modding I do is 95% in the form of whispers and emails, suggestions and civility, and very little "public spectacle") <br/><br/><b>* Keep it in perspective</b>: In my Wednesday gaming group, there are four members. All of them at one point or other have or had an account here. Travis is a HUGE gaming freak, knowing and reading everything out there on his purchases, and he doesn't participate here *at all*. Matthew is pretty much the same way: Thinks about gaming even more than I do at times, is working on a design or two, loves reading articles and blogs, but has totally self-selected himself out of All Forum Communication, because he's just had too many bad experiences with it. So it's Me and Quintin. Got that? 1/2 of <i>my own gaming group</i> actually participates in the forum that I run. Humility is awesome for keeping it real and in perspective. <br/>--And on that note, I often stop myself from saying, "Shit, if this person thinks its bad HERE, then they should just go to [CAUSTIC RPG FORUM X] instead HAR HAR HAR". While it may be true that "it's nicer here than anywhere else" or whatever, that doesn't mean that that's a pass to Make It Shitty here, or go lax on being genuine and kind to people just because it doesn't happen anywhere else (so 'folks should be used to it").<br/><br/>Anyway, those are some of the rules I live by Here and on the Internet in general.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253607/#Comment_253607" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T20:05:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  8:05PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11316" rel="nofollow">recent thread I'd been afraid to start</a>, the discussion went very well and stayed respectful even though the issue was both very personal and highly controversial.<br/><br/>I did lay out some simple ground rules, and people seemed to respect them even though I didn't have any authority to enforce them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253615/#Comment_253615" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T21:44:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  9:44PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's a good point, Ryan!<br/><br/>About a year or more ago during a previous biorythm slump, the pain of the moment was "All these people aren't answering my thread the way I want them to!"

And the longer it takes to rationally address someone else's comments, the more likely I am to start seeing flaws in my own position. But more importantly, the longer it takes, the more likely I am to throw up my hands and declare that it's just not worth my time. <br/><br/>Be aware of how much time you spend writing posts. Then when someone pisses you off and you're ready to dive into a rant, stop and ask yourself how much time it will take. Is it worth spending all that time? Aren't there better things you could be doing? Take a break, let it go, come back later and see (a) whether you can still be bothered to reply, (b) whether someone else has already made an adequate response, (c) whether the time away has refreshed your perspective and lets you make a succinct calm response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253965/#Comment_253965" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T15:39:48+00:00" title="January 30, 2010  3:39PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell, let's sticky this for a little bit.

I'd post something, or post a reply, and then get some snarky, assholish reply. I'd reply once or twice, trying to explain my position, again, cause I've come to accept sometimes people have issues with my writing, or just to verify. Then, if we keep disagreeing, or if the person is truly being an asshole, I pop an ICQ message to one of my friends, and stop replying to them, and move on. I don't bother saying "We'll agree to disagree", and while it chaffs me that they may consider themselves "right" for having said the last word, I'm more and more moved to not care about that.<br/><br/>That gets me to my next point. There's ranting and there's ranting. Ranting in public, well, flame-wars. But I sometimes enjoy complaining like an old man. I complain, in a semi serious but also semi non-serious way. I usually do it in private, to friends. I do find it cathartic, but you need to be careful not to get all riled up and excited about your anger, working yourself up, especially if/when your friend agrees with you that the other side is Wrong/Douche. I let steam off, and that's enough, which touches on Christian's post.<br/><br/>Sadly, to me, with Christian's post, is that many a thoughtful post or blog post I wrote, and even an RPG or two, I wrote inside my head, and then I didn't write them down, because the important thing was done.<br/><br/>Also, there's one thing that bothers me: Being passive-aggressive is not a form of being civil, it's being <i>rude</i>, it's doubly-rude because when called on it, people often point to what was said above: Assume that the other side is being nice, that the other side is not looking for an argument.<br/>Don't be passive-aggressive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254373/#Comment_254373" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T18:13:23+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  6:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my big one, by the way: Don't Debate.

I can't add to the advice around feelings, so...cognition? <br/><br/> Manage your contributions. Both for others and for your own sanity!  This includes all the 'knowing when to walk away' stuff mentioned above. These are excellent <b>cures</b> - what to do when something flares up. Also, it's being sensible about what you can manage, and how much of you can be taken by others. This is <b>prevention</b>, ways to lower the load and reduce the likelihood that an issue will even reach the horizon. I'll unpack that a tad. <br/><br/>If you start contributing to a dozen threads at once, you may be in danger of over-extending yourself. Will you be able to give other people's contributions the attention they deserve, or steamroller through to keep 'on top' of every thread? There's more chance of points being missed and hackles being raised if you're trying to be everywhere, rather than be one place, well. <br/><br/>This holds particularly true for threads you start, which hold greater expectations of involvement.   I use a rule of thumb: simply count how many threads that you have started are on the first page. Your mileage will vary, but I find that beyond two it gets difficult to guarantee a full and generous attitude towards other contributions. If I see more, I realise my enthusiasm is outpacing my ability to be a generous contributor. <br/><br/>Moreover, taking the other side of the coin, if you are dominating the board this may foster resentment. Or worship! I'm really just getting at the fact that as you become more visible you are also developing a personal brand, intentionally or no. It's worth being mindful of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254842/#Comment_254842" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T14:55:33+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  2:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>if you are dominating the board this may foster resentment</blockquote>QFT.

I notice that those discussions I create that have even the slightest whiff of controversy about them attract <i>way</i> more attention than those that do not.  Which would lead me to the inevitable conclusion that the only way I can have an interaction with my fellow users is to potentially push their buttons, something I really <i>don't</i> want to be forced into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260943/#Comment_260943" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-09T09:51:04+00:00" title="March  9, 2010  9:51AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think conflict inevitably leads to interest.
