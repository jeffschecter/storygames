I wrote up some extensive <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/shemya/gr_5.6_examples.pdf" rel="nofollow">examples of play</a> for Grey Ranks and I'd love some feedback.  I want these to convey both mechanical reinforcement (hitting on things you actually do with dice and so forth) but also a feeling of tone and interaction that I'm hoping for.  To that end the dialog is a little sloppy, with players slipping in and out of character and cracking on each other a bit.  If you've seen Grey Ranks I'm interested in your thoughts, but if you haven't, I'm particularly interested in your read on this.  Is it tedious?  Maudlin?  Forced?  Cryptic?  Unitarded? <br/><br/>The current draft has isolated examples interspersed where it makes the most sense, but I'm going to add "See page 14" notes to the examples and keep them intact in three spots in the rules section instead, to preserve the tone and table-talk aspects.<br/><br/>Thanks very much!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pfstrack" title="pfstrack"><img alt="pfstrack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pfstrack">pfstrack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58482/#Comment_58482" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T08:54:29+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  8:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've play tested Grey Ranks once and the actual play narrative seems to fit pretty well.

You have one of the players saying "Ausweis, bitte" on p. 4 and another player immediately concluding they were in trouble. I couldn't figure it out at first. I ran the phrase through a translator and figured out the German meant "Show me your documents, please". The German was nice flavor, but it meant I got lost while I was reading.<br/><br/>The rest of it made sense, though (bearing in mind that I have read the rest of the rules).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58483/#Comment_58483" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T08:58:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  8:58AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2007 9:00AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Paul!<br/><br/>I'll fix that:<br/><br/>JOEL:  Ausweis, bitte?<br/>MARK:  What?<br/>JOEL:  For Pete's sake, Mark!

So, with that in mind, these examples of play worked quite well.  I had a good sense of the game flow, even though I don't really know the rules, and I also felt the increasing tension within the group as things gradually fell apart.  Nobilis did a similar thing, and I thought that it was quite helpful.<br/><br/>So, thumbs up from me!<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58509/#Comment_58509" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T11:18:29+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 11:18AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2007 11:19AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys.  Bryan, that stuff will have a "see page" margin note, and will hopefully have been addressed in the game text by the time you read the example, so that's not a big worry.  The cookie comment was meant to be sincere - like, "I've got snacks".  But your reading is also fine!  Would beer be less ambiguous?<br/><br/>I waver on whether I need the "d4 means <i>four sided die</i>, which you can buy at your local hobby store" paragraph.  I could see this game being used in non-traditional settings, I guess, but I didn't write it with the guy who needs that paragraph in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58529/#Comment_58529" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T12:27:24+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 12:27PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good stuff. I like the fact it's so long. It's not tedious, maudlin, forced or cryptic, and I'm not sure what unitarded means.<br/><br/>I generally like the tone in which it's written: it's conversational but still has substance. That said, I don't like the first two lines:\n<blockquote>DAVE: ...We're going for the full Grey Ranks experience, right?<br/>SOPHIE: Three sessions, all ten chapters. Can't wait!</blockquote>\nIt sounds a bit self-aggrandising to me, almost as if you'd written:\n<blockquote>DAVE: So, you guys want to play some of that great game, Grey Ranks?<br/>SOPHIE: Sure do! Hot damn, that game is awesome!</blockquote>\nYou know what I mean? It comes across, to me, as faux enthusiasm. (This could be cultural, of course). <br/><br/>During the Lines And Veils discussion, I wonder whether "We'll veil that" is a bit technical (the technical term being "veil"). I prefer "Is it all right if we keep that off-screen?" from the previous paragraph: it describes the same thing in more natural language.<br/><br/>Those are small points, though: I think it's great. And I read the whole thing, which is quite surprising, seeing as I don't know the rules.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58533/#Comment_58533" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T13:02:59+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  1:02PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Graham!

One of the things that jarred, for me, was the Lines and Veils section. It was all about "This is what a Line is" and "This is what a Veil is" and it just felt like a definition too far. <br/><br/>Personally, I felt it would be better if it just said "Before the game, talk about anything that makes people uncomfortable. You can either ban certain topics from the game entirely or draw a discreet veil over them: they happen, but you don't describe them in detail".<br/><br/>In other words, I think the terms Line and Veil are useful in this sort of forum, but, in the game text itself, it's worth considering more everyday language. We can disagree on that, of course.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it's interesting they ruled sexual violence out so quickly. In the example, it wouldn't have been out of place at all, especially if it was Veiled.<br/><br/>By the way, I agree that the cookie comment seems a little out of place. To me, it reads as though you've injected your slightly mischevious sense of humour into the script (and again when Sophie says "Hubba Hubba!"). But I'm reluctant to make that point too strongly, since I really like it in other places (such as when Sophie says "Oh, for Pete's sake, Mark").<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58655/#Comment_58655" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T04:51:21+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  4:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Graham, the sexual violence thing is just me - that's a hard line in anything I play, usually, so it was an obvious example.  I wanted to show in the example that you can directly and matter-of-factly address very serious shit in your discussion.  I think it is also a good example, because it is about as hairball as the game is likely to go (and if there is no line, it almost certainly <i>will </i>go there, particularly in later chapters).  At least for me.  <br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I think I could handle sexual violence in Grey Ranks personally, because it would be pretty much impossible to trivialize it or divorce it from real meaning.  I'd still veil it, though.<br/><br/>I'll change the cookie comment and think more about how I discuss lines and veils.
