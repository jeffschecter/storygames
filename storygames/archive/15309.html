A large mailing list exists,[4] in which members debate aspects of the world they are creating, discussing additions, modifications, issues arising, and work to be done.<br/><br/>[..]<br/><br/>OA is a part of the transhuman space opera subgenre. The world was influenced by Iain M. Banks' Culture series, Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep, and David Brin's Uplift Universe, among others. It takes the concept of the technological singularity directly from the work of Vernor Vinge among others. In Orion's Arm, there is not one singularity but at least six, and they refer not to stages in the technological development of civilizations as a whole, but to different levels of consciousness in individuals. The concept of Toposophics used in this setting is inspired by the work of Stanis\u0142aw Lem.<br/><br/>I leave you this link to start exploring: <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-topic/492d76d2f173e" rel="nofollow">Archailects</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347856/#Comment_347856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T10:29:35+00:00" title="November  4, 2011 10:29AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had someone (Pilgrim) who wanted to do an adaptation of Sufficiently Advanced for the Orion's Arm setting. There are major portions of it at the SA wiki site and an unfinished <a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0Bw-4erryv_EXNWVhYzI0OTgtZTA3MC00YmM5LTg5YWQtMmE1MmZiMmE5Mjdj&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">PDF version here</a>. It was almost to the point of getting a contract together back in '08, but the whole thing sort of fell apart for reasons I don't remember.<br/><br/>It's a fairly neat setting if you don't mind digging into terminology.
