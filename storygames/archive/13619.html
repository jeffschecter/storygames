It's sort of in the same genre as that reaction-time totem-grabbing game you like to play (the name of which apparently escapes me at the moment), except with plastic parts and better played tired than drunk.<br/><br/>European boardgames... it's a broad field. What sort of boardgames do you like, and do you have prior experience with distinctly European games that might be used as benchmarks?<br/><br/>Personally, I'm endlessly fascinated by <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9341/lost-valley" rel="nofollow">Lost Valley</a>, which I find a very tasteful and progressive take on the American-originating fantasy exploration boardgame genre that was all the rage in my youth - like Talisman, but more random, more strategy, more of everything except play-time, which is very controlled. If the theme were fantasy instead of old west this game'd be a huge popular favourite, I'm sure; as it is, it's a cult classic that seems to be constantly at short supply around here.<br/><br/>In the heavier end of the scale I might mention <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3307/wallenstein" rel="nofollow">Wallenstein/Shogun</a>, an excellent example of an European take on the second America's genre of boardgaming, the wargame: the game's all about zero-sum fighting for the game board, but the limited option sets caused by the choice of cards and resource pools take away all practical chances for on-board politics, kingmaking and all that stuff. Resembles recent Fantasy Flight Games efforts in being a hybrid design.<br/><br/>I'm also fond of Reiner Knizia on his better days. <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105/colossal-arena" rel="nofollow">Arena</a> and <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3/samurai" rel="nofollow">Samurai</a> are two examples of the man at his best - and he's the best there is when he's in top form. Both games are abstractly solid games first, but with naturally fit themes on top, and very thoroughly playtested, too. Actually, I'll name <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42/tigris-euphrates" rel="nofollow">Tigris &amp; Euphrates</a>, that's a third one that's like those. Knizia is basically the god of German game design, so if you just want the archetypic high-quality experience, these can't go wrong. Better than Catan or Carcassonne, to be sure.<br/><br/>The selection of games is huge overall, though, and there's an almost endless smorgasbord of delightful variety and unique ideas. I like <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/915/mystery-of-the-abbey" rel="nofollow">Mystery of the Abbey</a>, which is like Clue for grown-ups; <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert" rel="nofollow">Space Alert</a>, with simultaneous time-controlled co-op play; <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11971/kakerlaken-poker" rel="nofollow">Cockroach Poker</a>, which suits the whole family and speaks to my delicate Diplomacy-player sensibilities. Too many great games to mention, really, and that shows in the field in general, I find; there are really not any real "canonical classics" that everybody should get the way there is for some other fields of gaming. This is probably because the Euro-gaming scene is still relatively young, at least in its most recent iteration.<br/><br/>If you have a list of the games you'll get your pick from, we could look into that - chances are there are some games in there that I can comment on from experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307842/#Comment_307842" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T20:09:44+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  8:09PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eero.  My collection of "Euro"-style and faux "Euro" style games is pretty extensive and eclectic.  Wallenstein, Samurai, and Tigris &amp; Euphrates are some of my favorites.  Mystery of the Abbey I didn't play enough to form an opinion on and Space Alert I played enough to decide "bonus points for clever, but I'm not really a fan".  I'm mostly interested in titles that may not have made the jump across the pond as the ones that have I probably already own ...;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLoopin' Louie looks really silly...kind of of the ilk of Hungry Hungry Hippos or Breakin' the Ice from back in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nLost Valley I'd not heard of...I'll see if he has that for trade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone heard of Supergang?

At its core its very abstract, and yet the game is so well tied to its theme (I don't subscribe to the "Knizia's theme's are just pasted on" school of criticism) that it is a better reflection of Sumerian civilization than I think a more hard core "simulation" could actually accomplish.  It's not strictly for 4, although I think that it plays better that way than with three.  Euphrates and Tigris reimagines the board game as a card game and while it is certainly more streamlined (and perhaps even a better "game") it looses alot of the pagaentry that makes me love T&amp;E.;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
