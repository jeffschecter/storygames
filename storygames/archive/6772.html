(This is mostly for NPCs, but it works for PCs too).<br/><br/>I start with me. Then I come up with some number of things that I personally doubt (or don't believe) and decide that the character believes them. Then I take some number of things that I do believe and make the character doubt them. Then I play towards those differences from myself.<br/><br/>I think I do this because sometimes what a character doubts (or wants to believe) is more interesting than what they believe.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150642/#Comment_150642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T17:10:24+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, this\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>sometimes what a character doubts (or wants to believe) is more interesting than what they believe.</blockquote>\nis a classic piece of drawing characters, well worth repeating.<br/><br/>I like your idea quite a lot. In fact this is one way I had repeated characters interact with pieces of the setting in highly complicated settings like the oWoD. Vampires who said "You are aware that the Cain myth is a <i>myth</i>, yes? The evidence for evolution is overwhelming, and just because we're hiding the ball from scientists doesn't mean they're wrong about what they DO have to work with..." or post-Imperial Star Wars villains who said "All evidence suggests that Force devotees couldn't run a roadside juice stand as well as a 9-year-old girl, so we are systematically purging them from any position of responsibility."  This creates interesting tension, especially when playing with people who are really devoted to the normal view of the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150646/#Comment_150646" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T17:18:07+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  5:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This creates interesting tension, especially when playing with people who are really devoted to the normal view of the setting.</blockquote>\nAgreed.

I've always liked settings like Glorantha, where the default material didn't even tell you the ultimate truth, that way you almost couldn't help having cool belief conflicts.  Of course, our RQ games always ended being about killing things and taking their stuff, but the setting was cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150683/#Comment_150683" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T21:10:51+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really well put idea, Paul!

At first I thought "man, I'm going to burn off that Key of Faith ASAP", but now I'm loving it.  His religious orientation has been an important factor in the game and drives his behavior in fun and surprising ways.  In a crew of miserable opportunists, he's a good guy.  It's very contrary to my usual way of playing.

I've heard it said that our characters always contain at least a tiny sliver of ourselves, anyway, so you might as well think about what sliver you're using.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you thought about adding this twist: pick something you doubt. Your character beleives it to be true. Now, why do they beleive that?<br/>\nPick something you beleive. Your character doubts that it's true. What would it threaten in their lives if they found out it REALLY WAS true?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've just created a two concerns for your character. They don't have to always question the validity of the game system, they can question the validity of your own world, right?
