This can go indefinitely until the characters or, maybe, the overarching plot have been played out.<br/>You can set up your world/theme/scenario to be geared toward campaign play.

The original goal was just to play through the five published modules for <i>BH</i>, but that goal shifted to a long-term campaign involving <a href="https://promisecity.blogspot.com/2017/02/send-in-troupes.html" rel="nofollow">troupe play</a>, as hinted at in the rules.<br/><br/>Some lessons learned, in no particular order -\n<ul> We make extensive use of written orders and campaign turns, 'zooming in' on the action as needed. If two sets of orders present a conflict between player characters, the third adjudicates, and on one occasion, we brought in a 'guest referee' to help out.<br/><br/>We keep copious notes. I keep a log of the action and we have an Excel file for storing notes on non-player characters - the latter is especially helpful for keeping track of facts introduced in actual play and to record reaction rolls, which tend to 'ride' until a situation would likely cause the non-player character to re-evaluate the relationship.<br/><br/>We're starting to use the Profession rules from Sierra Madre Games' Burros &amp; Bandidos to generate events for the player characters - this helps to represent a living world which pulls the characters in.<br/><br/>We make extensive use of random rolls - reactions, encounters, et al.</ul>\nOne thing we haven't used is the <i>Mythic Game Master Emulator</i>, which I really like and used extensively in <a>other campaigns</a> - in this campaign, we're more likely just to throw a die for yes or no and maybe roll for a random encounter as a complication. I've really come to enjoy <a href="https://promisecity.blogspot.com/2016/11/secondary-skills.html" rel="nofollow">stripping the game down to bare essentials and winging the rest</a>.<br/><br/>This is a very traditional roleplaying game, and a rather minimalist one at that, so the onus is on us to think creatively and keep consistency. We've been moderately successful on that latter point - without specific rules like an Aspect to define a non-player character, it's important to keep a close track on things like reactions and past history in the relationship with a player character.<br/><br/>We've made it work so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466493/#Comment_466493" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-22T21:08:41+00:00" title="September 22, 2017  9:08PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That BH campaign sounds like an enormous amount of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea" title="Black_Vulmea"><img alt="Black_Vulmea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/nGG4BQE0LR8F5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea">Black_Vulmea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466495/#Comment_466495" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-22T21:18:06+00:00" title="September 22, 2017  9:18PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That BH campaign sounds like an enormous amount of fun.</p></div></blockquote>\nIt's a hoot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466500/#Comment_466500" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T00:10:32+00:00" title="September 23, 2017 12:10AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really interesting, and the writeups on the blog are excellent.

The first four are sandboxy to one degree or another, with the last skewing harder toward the traditional group of adventurers following the designer's plotted expectations. The first four - <i>BH1 Mad Mesa</i>, <i>BH2 Lost Conquistador Mine</i>, <i>BH3 Ballots &amp; Bullets</i>, and <i>BH4 Burned Bush Wells</i> - are each unique and interesting and <a href="http://black-vulmea.blogspot.com/2012/12/random-encounters-that-dont-suck.html" rel="nofollow">in a couple of cases strongly influenced how I approach roleplaying games generally</a>. <br/><br/>The first, <i>Mad Mesa</i>,  is a choose-your-own solo adventure with notes and additional encounters to expand into a group adventure. The modular nature of the solo adventure - it's <i>designed</i> to be played in different orders, after all - made it easy to adapt to ref-less play - when we encountered one of the conflicts presented by the module, we figured out our plan, then consulted the solo adventure to guide to see how it would be resolved. <br/><br/>It was playing this adventure that we developed something that would prove really helpful later on: each of us would write orders for the way non-player characters would respond to our characters, then randomly chose one of the three after determining our own orders. It sounds more involved than it is in practice - frex, the npcs' plan could be described as 'a fighting withdrawal toward the stable' or 'a mad dash for the horses' or 'the riflemen dig in while the pistoleros attempt to flank around the hotel,' then we make our characters' plan and pull one of the three to see what happens next. We also make regular use of the Morale rules for non-player characters, which frequently makes a mess of <i>everyone's</i> plans.<br/><br/>The second module, <i>Lost Conquistador Mine</i>, was designed as a tournament module - it is also very modular, filled with situations which could be encountered in any order up through the 'key' encounter which puts the map to the mine in the player characters' hands. This is where we started to head in different directions, as my character was run out of town by vigilantes for 'being good at cards while Mexican.' At that point, I more-or-less took over refereeing the rest of <i>Lost Conquistador</i> while the other two players refereed my own character's experiences in Promise City, site of the third adventure, <i>Ballots &amp; Bullets</i>. Both of the other players' characters were dry-gulched following a false lead for the mine, so <i>Lost Conquistador</i> remains unfinished, an 'open book' (or an open wound . . . ).<br/><br/><i>Ballots &amp; Bullets</i> is a sprawling campaign module, a mini-campaign about the twelve weeks preceding a local election. The module includes over two hundred non-player characters, multiple factions and organizations - it also contains something I never encountered in any other module, a series of events involving npcs with no suggested or planned involvement by the players' characters. The players are meant to play the roles of the non-player characters for these vignettes, and they provide a true background narrative to the election.<br/><br/>It was about this time the long-term potential of the campaign began to present itself, so rather than dive right into <i>Ballots &amp; Bullets</i>, especially with two newly-introduced player characters, we decided that the characters arrived in town a year before the election. The goal was for our characters to become established in town, part of the community fabric, so that the elections' stakes would be more meaningful. As this was fall of 1873 in-game, we decided to run <i>Burned Bush Wells</i> in the winter between our arrival in Promise City and the election.<br/><br/><i>Burned Bush Wells</i>, like the other modules in the series, is a small sandbox which includes a traditional linear adventure delivered via random encounter. If you're scratching your head at how all that works together, you should track it down if at all possible - it's a very clever approach. Two of our characters decided to answer the call to hunt wolves in the snows around Burned Bush, but the other player's character decided it was too much risk for too little reward, leaving my character to finish the module. By now all three of our characters were heading in different directions, and week-long campaign turns with written orders became the norm, with the other two splitting up or sharing the refereeing duty for the third.<br/><br/>That spring we introduced our troupes - my cowboy, buffalo hunter, and mining engineer trio, the Pinkertons, and the hired killer and his <i>compadres</i>. It was then we played <i>Ballots &amp; Bullets</i>, which is dense with rules on how to run the political campaigns of the various candidates - thank Gawd for spreadsheets! - and which proved to be incredibly deadly. The valet of the Pinkertons was killed in action before we started the module, and five more characters - my surviving character's brother and best friend, one of the remaining Pinkertons, and the hired killer and his companion - died over the course of the election campaign itself. (At some point I need to do a postmortem blog post about this adventure.) The Pinkertons' player is bringing in two more detectives as replacements, the other player is talking about a Chinese tong in Promise City, and I decided, rather than introducing two more player characters to fill out my troupe, to take two non-player characters as 'henchmen.'<br/><br/>The fact that we as players took our characters in three very different directions made running the campaign <i>easier</i> rather than harder. Tracking events and particularly reactions and introduced facts about the non-player characters was critical to keeping a measure of congruity and verisimilitude - part of the fun is then building on what the other player(s) established about the character.<br/><br/>I also believe group size and chemistry plays a very significant role - more than three players and we risk the potential of characters being sidelined too long as well as too many cooks spoiling the broth.<br/><br/>I'm taking on the responsibility of running - more-or-less - the last module, <i>BH5 Range War!</i> my least favorite of the bunch. This one is aimed straight at the Pinkertons in their role as 'range detectives' and my character's involvement is most likely to be reactive in his role as undersheriff of El Dorado County, so it makes sense for me to do the job of adapting it to the campaign. <i>Range War!</i> is a traditional linear adventure with ham-handed plot hooks, which makes it my least favorite by far, but with a little elbow grease, it should yield some good sandboxy play more appropriate to the way our campaign's progressed over the last fourteen or so months.<br/><br/>Sorry to drone on and on - I hope at least some of this was helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466513/#Comment_466513" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-23T12:14:25+00:00" title="September 23, 2017 12:14PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It has been exceedingly helpful to me.<br/><br/>I tracked down the full run of BH's 1920s cousin, Gangbusters, and have been trying to figure out how to do something similar with that.<br/><br/>I'd toyed with the idea of doing a troupe style campaign for that, but hadn't considered pairing that with rotating GMship or similar.

"TToB" was the second of two non-<i>BH</i> adventures we adapted while my characters were on the cattle drive.

I find the idea of running a GMless campaign using force a traditional rule set and modules absolutely fascinating.<br/><br/>How did you use the modules in play, practically? Would everyone read them ahead of time, or would you pause play and read ahead together once you hit an important decision point?<br/><br/>I'm imagining this was easier with PCs in separate storylines, but I'm especially curious how it was handled in parts of the game where all the PCs were on screen at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea" title="Black_Vulmea"><img alt="Black_Vulmea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/nGG4BQE0LR8F5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea">Black_Vulmea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466526/#Comment_466526" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-24T00:25:00+00:00" title="September 24, 2017 12:25AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For <i>Mad Mesa</i>, we randomized the order of the various scenarios presented for group play, then worked from the solo adventure to guide the action. The scenarios are very wargamey - and I mean that in a positive way - in that they are open-ended: 'here's the situation at start, now go'; there isn't much in the way of, 'what's REALLY going on is . . . ' spoilery types of information, though there are some interesting tidbits for the players and their characters to learn here and there which tie into the range war which is the backdrop of the campaign. This is where our three takes on what the npcs are doing in response to the adventurers became helpful, along with reaction and morale rolls - from what I've read in the gm-less design thread, it sounds like what we did was analogous to some sort of cards used to determine the direction of an encounter once it was initiated. <br/><br/>For <i>Lost Conquistador</i>, I literally copied and cut up the scenarios presented as part of the adventure - these situations often <i>do</i> have information to which the adventurers should not be privy for risk of spoiling first-person, in-character immersion as there are mysteries to this adventure - highlighted the initial situation, and stuck them in an envelope. When we randomly determined a situation came up, we'd read the set-up, then roleplay our response, once again guided by reaction rolls, morale rolls, and 'hmmm . . . I'd say he does <i>x</i> on a roll of 1-4 on d6' discussion. My character got run out of town fairly quickly - call it five days into the adventure? - so at that point most of the encounter-running just shifted to me, right up to the point the other characters got themselves dry-gulched.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, in <i>Flashing Blades</i> campaign I ran, I prepped open-ended scenarios and then used <i>MGME</i>, which would honestly be much easier to do here, but for this campaign, I just wanted to play as rules-light as we could go, and so this was what we worked out. It's klunky and kludgey but I'm not a game designer or gaming theorist, so whatever works right now is good enough, and if works more than once, we tend to stick with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466527/#Comment_466527" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-24T00:32:46+00:00" title="September 24, 2017 12:32AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fascinating!

It incorporates the maps and counters from the 1st ed boxed set, and some of thee setting info from Trouble Brewing, along with a brief slice of the Death on The Docks module.<br/><br/>There is no 2nd Ed. No one really knows why this is. Presumably 'printing' and 'edition' were used as synonyms, leading to the weird designation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea" title="Black_Vulmea"><img alt="Black_Vulmea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/119/nGG4BQE0LR8F5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea">Black_Vulmea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466617/#Comment_466617" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-27T16:11:49+00:00" title="September 27, 2017  4:11PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" rel="nofollow">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Black_Vulmea">@Black_Vulmea</a> Up-thread you mentioned you'd like to create a multi-generational game.

I love the idea of a Prohibition in the Southwest campaign, and I'm fascinated by the idea of tracking the growth of Promise City from the Wild West boom town of <i>Boot Hill</i> into a modern city of tens of thousands suitable for a <i>GangBusters</i> campaign - saloons into speakeasies, rustlers and outlaws into Kansas City mobsters and local hoods.<br/><br/>But if we stick with what we're doing, we've got the a couple of range wars, the Apache Wars, the Spanish-American War, the Mexican Revolution, and the Great War to get through first.<br/><br/>It would feel like 'cheating' to me to simply pull the plug on the <i>BH</i> campaign to jump to <i>GB</i>, but we will move to a more strategic level of play, along the line of <a href="http://black-vulmea.blogspot.com/2013/05/building-stronghold.html" rel="nofollow">the domain game</a>, in keeping with <i>Burros &amp; Bandidos</i>.

Seems that Most of you have such a wealth of experience in the rpg world. I'm a humble neophyte. I appreciate learning from you.    I've made a hack of "once upon a time" (the card game) (which uses random story elements).  I've incentivized reincorporation of elements into a more connected and coherent narrative with the "chekhov's gun rule". The incentive could either empower characters, or narrative control of players. This would depend on what kind of system was in place... but here's the idea:  apparently Chekhov had the sensible rule that if something appeared in his plays (like a gun) it had to important or be revealed as important in the unfolding of the narrative. So in our context rewards accrue to players who are able to make an element of the already established storyline cohere meaningfully with other elements (new or already established) in the story.   this by itself might address the shaggy dog issue... but I've also combined it with a scaffold of 15 story beats the narrative is constrained to move through and I've never tried these elements in isolation (as one should in good scientific method;). <br/><br/>Re surprise meter:  is this part of the emulator?  If so, never mind  I'll learn about it when I check it out myself. If not, could you explain what this mechanic is and how you've used it?  Sounds interesting. <br/><br/>I wish I had time to keep up with all the posts here. So much intelligent and sincere and positive conversation!  It's awesome. <br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Davey. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466647/#Comment_466647" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-29T00:44:36+00:00" title="September 29, 2017 12:44AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh.

It just slows down game-play.<br/>For solo play or two players, the story can get quite predictable so Mystic GM Emulator style suprises are quite welcome.<br/>Don't look at the surprise meter as a rigid mechanical tool but rather a visible indicator of the group's desire for reliability vs unexpectedness in the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21265/are-there-campaign-gmless-story-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21265/are-there-campaign-gmless-story-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21265/are-there-campaign-gmless-story-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21265%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21265%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
