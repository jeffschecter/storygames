And I've got a few questions. I wasn't sure the best place to ask them so here me hoping here's good.<br/><br/>1. Is there a form-fillable version of the protagonist sheet out there? It's a beauty to behold and I'd like but online I'm having to resort to txt file version. No where near as enticing.<br/><br/>2. When protagonist's try to remove a locked adjective, like severed or deaf, they get a cybernetic implant to replace what they lost, like a cyberleg or cyberears. The section says "Locked adjectives require replacement". But what about recovering from locked emotional adjectives, like smitten or paranoid? What object could be implanted to replace what's lost, if that's peaceful state-of-mind or something. I can imagine some kind of procedure---like to remove smitten you have to apply nanobot neurowash twice a day. But the way the section's worded, I wonder if I'm missing something.  <br/><br/>3.  In Mechnoir, I don't quite get the first dot point under Vectors and Scales, which says individuals need to band together to affect rigs. Specifically: "Each supporter rolls to give an actor a fleeting positive adjective to represent his help (or the GM might automatically give the actor a positive adjective based on a large number of nonplayer supporters)." What reaction rating are supporters rolling against: the actor's or the rigs. I'm guessing it's not the actor because why would the actor actively try to prevent the adjective being asserted. As page 112 says under unopposed action, we can bypass rolling the dice and skip right to applying the adjective if no-one is actively opposing the adjective being asserted. there's. But I suppose the rig might be opposing, but that doesn't quite gel with the GM advice. Anyhoo, can I assume the supporters must roll against the rig's reaction rating?<br/><br/>4. Are there any one sentence descriptions for the new Training Programs in Mechnoir? I found the one's in Technoir really useful.<br/><br/>5. When adding connections on the plot map, what happens if the players ask favours of a connection that is part of the mission seed, which thus is already added and connected on the plot map. Should I still allow protagonists to have two favours from them, and just add two more connection lines from them, or should I deny any favours from them because they're already added and connected on the map? I assume the former but I'm not really sure.<br/> <br/>Cheers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398414/#Comment_398414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T04:46:25+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  4:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no luck getting any answers.

Sort of a genre issue, I think, injecting some of the cyberpunk flavor in there and showing what sort of toll is taken by the lifestyle the characters lead. With some severe psychosis maybe you have hardware installed that triggers a release of chemicals in your brain to counteract it or something. Personally I'd probably just work with the fiction and the players towards a fitting solution, whether it required actual object installation or not.<br/><br/>#3: My impression here is that vector is king. Determine who the helper is acting against and that should lead you to your opposed reaction rating. Remember too that you're not rolling against the Rig so much as the operator. The operator being backed up by the scale of the Rig is what requires you to band together and help each other or find some other plausible vector. A character and a Rig operate at such different scales in the fiction that special vectors are required to have any effect at all. So unless you've got a plausible vector you're unlikely to be able to produce a helping adjective by acting directly against the Rig operator.<br/><br/>#4: Not as far as I know, which seems like an oversight to me. I mean, I can figure some things out but it would have been nice to have a little direction for how the roles tie into the Mechnoir milieu. Like, why are Priests so important that they're one of the training programs? Where do Marshals fit in to the setting? And so on. The exposition on the last page of the pdf gives some insight, but there should probably be some explicit text as well regarding the training programs.<br/><br/>#5: What I've been doing when a Connection is part of the mission seed is basically ignore page 58, since it doesn't cover that scenario. The procedure the text gives is meant to help you add depth to the Plot Map, but if that Connection is part of the mission seed then it's already integrated into the Plot Map. So I allow the two favors and usually don't draw any more lines to nodes. If something inspires me I'll draw or change whatever lines I want. The mission seeds and Plot Map are meant to be guidance and inspiration, not a straight jacket you have to maneuver within.<br/><br/>Hope some of that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398472/#Comment_398472" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T16:15:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  4:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome! Thanks for your comments.<br/><br/>I looks like we take the same approach for restoring locked adjectives (#2) and favours from seeded connections (#5). <br/><br/>I totally agree about working with the players. We kinda did that with Technoir, hash out together what with we think they mean for the setting, and it's the approach I'd take with Mechnoir Training Programs (#4).<br/><br/>And (for #2) I hadn't thought about psychiatry! An automated implant that monitors thought patterns and injects psychoactive drugs---sounds sweet! I suppose you could also take the psychologist route too and have a virtual therapist monitoring for triggers and talking you through crises. Or virtual acupuncturist, with acupuncture implants that that open your qi gates and increase flow. Ha! <br/><br/>But (#3) still confuses me. You're right about using the helper's vector to determine the opposed reaction rating. But I think my confusion is about what the vector is because I don't understand who's opposing the helper.<br/><br/>And my understanding is that someone has to oppose them. If no one opposes the helper, they can just bypass the dice and apply the positive adjective to the actor. <br/><br/>So given someone has to oppose the helper, who? It can't be the rigger, right, because I thought the whole point was that people and riggers can't oppose each other's actions: the scale thing. That basically means the helper can't have a vector against the rigger. <br/><br/>Or maybe the scale thing is about limiting consequences and not about limiting vectors. Maybe a helper can have vector against the rigger, it's just the helper can't apply an adjective to the rigger if they succeed. So maybe a rigger can oppose a helper's action, it's just that if the rigger fails to stop that action then the rigger's not directly affected. Instead, the helper applies positive adjectives in the form of positional advantages that the actor uses to make an effective assault; like gaining height while the rigger is being distracted. Hmmmm, that making some sense to me.<br/><br/>6. And, another thing, is it the case that actors against riggers can only use push dice from positive adjective they were given from the helpers? That would provide an incentive for multiple help attempts.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398478/#Comment_398478" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T17:51:01+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  5:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2012 5:51PM by C_Edwards.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And (for #2) I hadn't thought about psychiatry!

The Escort training program comes with Treat. So Treat is used to represent a general curing of what ails you, based upon who is doing the treating. A surgeon with Treat is going to be able to handle a different type of damage in a different way than a therapist with Treat.\n<blockquote>But (#3) still confuses me.

The helper may do something in the fiction to create a positive fleeting adjective that doesn't involve opposition. If that is the case then you just go ahead and create the fleeting tag. Whether the helper can have a vector against the rigger depends entirely on what you see as plausible given the specific fictional circumstances. So it may be unlikely that the helper has a vector against the rigger, given the different scales of action required, but I certainly wouldn't deem it impossible. It could happen through the helper sabotaging the Rig somehow (this is an example used in the Mechnoir pdf) and passing that adjective off for another PC to take advantage of, or through having leverage and an open line of communication so that the Rigger knows you have that leverage (such as a kidnapped loved one, etc.).\n<blockquote>6. And, another thing, is it the case that actors against riggers can only use push dice from positive adjective they were given from the helpers? That would provide an incentive for multiple help attempts</blockquote>\nAdjectives don't give you Push dice, they only allow you to use the Push dice you already have charged. According to the text, a PC only needs to use one of the helper adjectives made available to them, but they may use more if they have the Push dice to do so, or use some of their own adjectives or tags as well. What those fleeting adjectives created by helpers represent is a group effort in the fiction that can plausibly overcome some aspect of the Rig's scale difference. If things make sense in the fiction then you should be able to sort everything else out from that starting point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398483/#Comment_398483" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T21:12:56+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  9:12PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2012 9:24PM by watergoesred.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again for your comments Chris. This conversation is helping me clarify things for me.\n<blockquote>Nobody has to oppose the helper. The helper may do something in the fiction to create a positive fleeting adjective that doesn't involve opposition. If that is the case then you just go ahead and create the fleeting tag.</blockquote>\nBut the Mechnoir text says "Each support rolls to give the actor a fleeting positive adjective to represent his help". Taken with the core rules text that says if an action's unopposed then skip the dice, I assume the design is that PC helpers have to roll to help the actor and so someone has to be opposing their helping action. <br/><br/>The Mechnior text says the rigger "might find it difficult to affect one individual but she can easily hurt several at once with explosive weapons or stomping." This confirms that the rigger can oppose helpers action, if only in a blunt carpet-bombing way. So the scale thing (from the rigger's perspective) is about the rigger lacking the the resolution to act dexterously on a human scale.<br/><br/>So yeah, what this conversation has clarified for me is that, when banding together, helpers roll against the rigger's reaction rating (at least if you're following the rules.)\n<blockquote>It could happen through the helper sabotaging the Rig somehow (this is an example used in the Mechnoir pdf) and passing that adjective off for another PC to take advantage of, or through having leverage and an open line of communication so that the Rigger knows you have that leverage (such as a kidnapped loved one, etc.)</blockquote>\nSee I read the text as saying sabotage was an exception to the requirement that individuals have to band together to apply vectors on rigs:<br/><br/>"Individuals can use sabotage to affect massive vehicles." <br/>and<br/>"So banding together or sabotage is also required before a direct Hack..."<br/><br/>The confusing bit is that a sabotage roll may require a roll to first inflict a fleeting adjective to the rig like boarded or infiltrated. How do you apply boarded or infiltrated? Banding together?<br/><br/><br/>But...maybe there's a distinction here between "hurting" and "applying an adjective" to a rig? <br/><br/>The Contention procedure distinguishes between them in Step 2 and 7, and the rig  sheets have separate boxes for Tags and Negative Adjectives. So maybe the difference in scale does not prevent individuals applying negative adjectives on a rig, liked boarded or bogged, rather scale prevents individuals from damaging the rig's tags without some prep work. And that prep work includes applying negative adjectives and banding together.<br/><br/>Though I'm not sure why you would ever bother banding together. Presumably applying negative adjectives gives the rigger hurt dice that reduce their effectiveness so why wouldn't all the players individually attempt to sabotage. It seems to be mechanically better and fit what banding together would mean in the fiction anyway. <br/><br/>But surely, banding together isn't so useless. I've found banding together hard to grok and, now that I think I understand how individuals can go about fighting a rig, I don't actually see why players wouldn't ever tackle a rig by banding together.

You don't have to band together for mechanical purposes. I mean, only one adjective from a helper is all that's technically needed in that regard, right? And even if it wasn't you're not likely to have enough Push dice at your disposal to take advantage of more than three or so helping adjectives at a time anyway. You band together because the fiction requires you to do so.<br/><br/>So, vector and scale. In regular Technoir if you're standing in the street and some dude is coming at you in a large truck, and you want to stop him, you've got a few options. Maybe you shoot the driver through the windshield or you shoot out the tires. One thing you very likely can't do is grab the truck and throw it, right? That's just beyond what you can do because of the difference in scale between your character and the truck. It's not something you can do in the fiction of the game, so you can't even roll to try it. But if you were in a bulldozer you would then have a vector to go head on with that truck, because you'd then be operating on a similar scale in the fiction.<br/><br/>Mechnoir works the same way, but instead of a truck coming at you there's a ginormous mech. How do you stop it? What, to you and the rest of the group, sounds like plausible options? Do those options sound like they'd require a bunch of people to work together to succeed based upon how you see mechs in the fiction? If so then you need help, however much you think makes sense based on the fiction, and those helpers need to try and create fleeting positive adjectives to show that they're actually helping. If, like in my radio and leverage example in my post above, the PC is in a fictional position that doesn't require assistance, then no help is needed.<br/><br/>As to the opposition for a roll, once again, look to the fiction. Maybe I take a dozen people and create a distraction by giving the rigger another target to worry about. Then I'd probably be making a Coax roll against the rigger in an attempt to create a negative fleeting <i>distracted</i> adjective on the rigger. Why a dozen people? Because that's about the minimum number we decided would be needed for that action, right then during play based on our understanding of the scale of mechs and the ongoing fiction.<br/><br/>When it comes to helping remember that helpers have to create fleeting positive tags for another PC. Since you can only create tags for your target a helper's target has to be the PC they're trying to help. Maybe I'm a Marshal and I'm helping someone by calling in a drone airstrike, giving them the positive fleeting <i>supported</i> adjective. No roll required as the person I'm helping isn't opposing my efforts. Maybe to get access to the drones for the airstrike I had to go through a Coax contest with someone first. But once I've won access through that contention I can just apply the positive fleeting adjective on the PC I'm helping based on my ability in the fiction to now call an airstrike. Of course you might decide that the drone airstrike is something at a scale similar to a mech and the Marshal can have an Operate, or maybe Shoot, contention versus the rigger to put a negative <i>bombarded</i> adjective on the rigger. That's for you to decide.<br/><br/>Technoir definitely has a different approach and edge cases can crop up during play. Just try and remember to lead with the fiction, that you can only place adjectives on your target, and that contentions only happen between characters. That should get you through most of the difficult spots that come up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398619/#Comment_398619" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T00:50:31+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 12:50AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrms I think I want Technoir and Mechnoir.

I have run Technoir, six or seven sessions in the last month or so, and I agree with your approach. I haven't had any problems so far with the focus on character vs. character, leading with fiction, applying adjectives, or fitting the contention procedures with particulars of a fictional situation. <br/><br/>I can see I was less than clear at the end of my last post when I talked about banding together vs. sabotage. There's banding together in the fiction, and "banding together" in the mechanics where, rules as written, the players must roll to apply a positive adjective to an ally before they try to actually damage the rig. Likewise, there's sabotage in the fiction, and "sabotage" in the mechanics where the players "roll to apply a negative adjective to the rig". I didn't clearly indicate I was talking about the mechanical issues, that I was talking about "roll to apply a positive adjective to an ally" vs. "roll to apply a negative adjective to the rig". <br/><br/>I understand leading with the fiction. And Technoir's so flexible that any fiction I can come up with for fighting a rig, I can interpret in mechanical terms as trying to apply a positive adjective to an ally or a negative adjective to the rig. This flexibility is fine, is great, except that applying negative adjectives are clearly superior. The only time I see applying a positive adjective is sensibly, mechanically, is if you do so without rolling. And that applies in Technoir as much as Mechnoir. Indeed, it was one of players who has steered in that direction.<br/><br/>But the rules as written in Mechnoir say players roll to support when "banding together". So this is what's left me perplexed after our conversation. This is a different perplexion to where I started from. This conversation has clarified a few things around this for me. But I'm left with that I just don't see my players ever using the "banding together" mechanics. Sure my players will band together in the fiction, but I just don't see they'll ever "roll to apply and a positive adjective to an ally" when their protagonists' actions could just as easily be interpreted to meet the condition of the superior "roll to apply a negative adjective to the rig". <br/><br/>And sure, my players will go for the free positive adjective if the fiction justifies it. But the rules as written suggest the freebie is the exception (for NPCs help) rather than the rule (PCs helping.) <br/><br/>So that's what's left me perplexed. Let's be clear, this perplexion won't break the game for me. But I'd hoped the "banding together" rule would be cool and useful, but now I grok it I just can't see it ever being used or useful. And it makes me wonder why it's even there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398645/#Comment_398645" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T10:52:18+00:00" title="November 25, 2012 10:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 11:12AM by C_Edwards.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I get where you're coming from now, and I agree. While, by the rules, you <i>have</i> to get help (in the form of fleeting positive adjectives) in proportion to whatever makes sense in the fiction to bridge the scale gap between the PCs and a rig, doing so isn't particularly helpful mechanically. That's the case in vanilla Technoir as well in my experience. The PCs are rarely lacking in sufficient positive adjectives or tags to allow them to use the Push dice they have available, so making even more positive adjectives available isn't very useful.\n<blockquote>I understand leading with the fiction.

So there's no way, by the rules, for a roll against the rigger to apply a positive adjective to a PC. The target of your roll would have to be the PC for whatever action you're taking. Which that player could then decline to oppose, making the application of the adjective automatic.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the "banding together" rule only exists to engender a certain type of fiction. It's a genre emulation rule basically. Like you said, nothing is going to break if you ignore it, as long as you make sure the actions the PCs are taking against a rig/rigger make sense given the differences in scale and the vectors involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398657/#Comment_398657" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-25T14:24:21+00:00" title="November 25, 2012  2:24PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2012 2:25PM by watergoesred.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your point about on being able to apply the adjective only to the target is well made. I had missed its ramifications when you mentioned it earlier. <br/><br/>So, okay, players basically never roll when they're "banding together" because there's never going to anyone opposing being the target of help. That makes sense. So the whole "Each support <b>rolls</b>..." is just one big fat juicy red herring.
