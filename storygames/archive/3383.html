It's a resolution system.<br/><br/>Whenever a player's character - or an NPC - wants to do something difficult or dramatic, let <b>another</b> player draw a card and narrate how the situation resolves. This is important, so I'll repeat it: If <i>you're</i> trying to do something, someone <i>else</i> will draw the card and tell you how it works out.<br/><br/>The cards are:<br/><br/><b>Yes, but...</b> You succeed, but something completely unrelated goes wrong, for someone you or someone you care about.<br/><b>Yes, but...</b> You succeed, but lose something valuable in the process.<br/><b>Yes, and...</b> You succeed, and achieve more than you expected.<br/><b>Yes, and...</b> You succeed, and that gives you the initiative for a new thrust or follow-up.<br/><b>No, but...</b> You fail, but another positive thing happens instead, unrelated to what you were aiming for.<br/><b>Meanwhile, somewhere else...</b> Cut the scene just before we get to know the result. Come back to the scene later.<br/><b>The conflict escalates!</b> Tension rises as the conflict, the problem or the stakes are raised a notch. Come back to the scene later.<br/><b>You need help.</b> You end up understanding you need the help of someone not currently in the scene to achieve this.<br/><b>Locked!</b> You're locked in the conflict or situation. You have to try a new approach.<br/><b>Yes, but only if...</b> You can get what you want - but only if you choose to make a certain sacrifice. <br/><br/><i>What I don't want from this thread:</i><br/>- Reasons why the whole concept sucks, will never work, and/or isn't your cup of tea<br/><i><br/>What I want from this thread:</i><br/>- Thoughts on other possible cards<br/>- Thoughts on how to improve the wording of these cards<br/>- Possible problems with specific cards                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76559/#Comment_76559" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T01:07:39+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  1:07AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, and...

You'll also probably want to stick with just a few cards per deck.<br/><br/>In a TT game, you can use a common deck, but other issues crop up. Example: What is the spread of cards? Are any repeated? When is the deck shuffled (classically a joker is used as a reshuffle card in minis wargames that use cards something like this)? NOT shuffling everytime gives a bit of a different feel, for example, and can raise tension in a different way.<br/><br/>Finally, you have the abillty to manipulate deck content. In addition to the basic outcome stuff you're talking about for the core deck, you could also add in stuff relevant to a given scenario, such as cards hat move time along or trigger events. At a more basic level, they could simply cause scene changes or move events through the sort of classic story progression. Some of that is already implied in cards that have been posited you could make it even more blatant.<br/><br/>Good thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76775/#Comment_76775" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T08:09:28+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  8:09AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Theatrix flowcharts might provide some guidance, as well as new cards here, if you can find them.

My vibe is something like "only draw the cards if you want some sort of complication" - a form of "say yes or roll the dice". A simple "yes" or "no" in such a situation can be anticlimactic. <br/><br/>During one session of playtest we used the cards about 10-12 times - too many "straight" results would have taken some of the oomph out of that session, I believe. But it's worth trying out - especially with Ryan's added text.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Komradebob,<br/><br/>In playtest, we had one of each card, and reshuffled when the deck was empty. However, the players didn't know exactly what cards were in the deck, so there was some element of surprise. I imagine that when we all know what cards are there, we might end up reshuffling more often to avoid "counting cards" etc.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of having scenario-specific resolution cards!<br/><br/>You wrote: "At a more basic level, they could simply cause scene changes or move events through the sort of classic story progression."

At a very basic level, any of the negative ("No"variant) cards could move the story forward from the begiinning of the story-&gt;succeeding Acts/minor complications+resolution-&gt;climax-&gt;wrap up.<br/><br/>That's a fairly raw way of looking at it. It would be easier to describe in conjunctio with something like Grey Ranks or Roach as an example, basically a set-up where time goes forward or events go forward.<br/><br/>Beginning: Play Continues until the number of "No" variant cards that have been seen = number of players, then move on to event 1:<br/>Event One: Play until <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23No-Cards&amp;Mode=like">#No-Cards</a> drawn= <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23players-1&amp;Mode=like">#players-1</a>, then go to Event 2.<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Mind you, it doesn't have to be the "No Variant cards" that propel stuff forward. It could be a special seperate card like the "Joker" I mentioned ( although I've seen a two-joker variant where one acts as a warning). It could be a set number of resolution draws. It could be scenario specific cards that are drawn, then build up and trigger other events, but aren't themselves resolution cards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76840/#Comment_76840" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T14:36:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  2:36PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Yes, because...</b>   Additional and unexpected factors assist you in getting what you want.<br/><br/><b>Yes, despite...</b>  Additional and unexpected factors come into play, but you suceeed <i>anyway</i>.<br/><br/>(And of course, the opposites apply as well).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76842/#Comment_76842" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T14:55:28+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  2:55PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but...you foster a negative relationship.<br/>No, and...you foster a negative relationship.<br/>Yes, and...you foster a positive relationship.<br/>No, but...you foster a positive relationship.<br/><br/>Something like that, to cause interplay between characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76858/#Comment_76858" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T18:54:04+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  6:54PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick question:<br/>Outside of these outcome cards, what's the rest of the game like?

The cards have been a success so far, and the authors are considering using them as the standard resolution system.<br/><br/>Itras By is a surrealistic setting. It's a city somewhere in limbo, a place of dream, with a 1920s feel. The Machine God fights the Futurists, the spider queen Nindra sits atop the Moon Tower and controls everything. One of the richest men in the city has the head of a musk ox, is unhappily in love, and is laughed at by his peers.<br/><br/>One of the main points of the system is the use of chance cards (not the same as the resolution cards in this thread). A player can draw a chance card at any time, though preferably not more than once per session. They typically introduce strangeness in the game, either in the game method or the fictional events. (One card requires you to re-play a scene; another makes everyone switch roles for a scene, so one of the players becomes the GM, the GM plays someone else's character etc; a third states that someone comes and gives the players a mission to accomplish).<br/><br/>The resolution cards complement the chance cards nicely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77123/#Comment_77123" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-22T11:02:26+00:00" title="June 22, 2007 11:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you have any background on the playtests or Actual play reports?<br/><br/>Also, is there anyway that has a list of the cards currently in the Chance Deck.<br/><br/>This sounds like a very interesting design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77267/#Comment_77267" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-23T12:30:52+00:00" title="June 23, 2007 12:30PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtest reports aren't up yet - my laziness + time pressure. <br/><br/>The Chance Deck is available online in Norwegian; perhaps Temple, Kaare or even Ole Peder himself have the time to do a rough English translation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77400/#Comment_77400" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-24T23:25:22+00:00" title="June 24, 2007 11:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><b>Yes, but only if...</b>You can get what you want - but only if you choose to make a certain sacrifice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><b>Yes, but...</b>You succeed, but lose something valuable in the process.</blockquote>\n<br/>I suggest dropping the second one.

They are meant to increase potential player input to the story and support the game\xe2\u20ac\u2122s surreal motif. When a card is pulled from the deck, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s read aloud. A card pulled must be used. The player who pulls the card interprets it, unless something else is specified.<br/><br/>* Reverse. Turn the clock back a few seconds. What happened to you before you pulled the card did not occur. Instead, the exact opposite thing happens. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to you to describe exactly what is reversed.<br/><br/>* Chess with destiny. Swap roles with the game master. You describe the setting, he controls your character. The swap lasts for the duration of this scene.<br/><br/>* Amor Victor: The power of love somehow affects the situation. Exactly how is for you to describe. <br/><br/>* Fast forward! It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been three hours since where you were when you pulled this card. Describe what condition you and the others find yourself in. You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re not allowed to describe what has happened in the meantime. <br/><br/>* Flashback. Play a scene that has occurred in the past where your character is right now. The player who pulls the card sets the scene and distributes NPCs for the other players to control.<br/><br/>* Haunted by your past! Something the character has done previously has consequences in the now. Tell the game master what you think this card means.<br/><br/>* Nemesis! This card awakens your Nemesis. In some way, your arch enemy affects the action. Exactly how is up to you. You say you have no arch enemy? Well, now you do. <br/><br/>* The character flaw. The last NPC you met, no matter who, has a dark secret, a weak spot or a negative trait. Your character doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily know what this is, but it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to you as the player to invent it. <br/><br/>* Stare not into darkness\xe2\u20ac\xa6 Your character feels an irresistible urge to do something he will regret. <br/><br/>* The wind changes. Temperature, smells and sounds mutate. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s up to the player who pulled the card to describe the exact effect. If someone nearby is making a face right now, they will turn into a Grimace Face \xe2\u20ac\u201c see description elsewhere.<br/><br/>* Double! The situation you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re currently in is doubled! If you are hurt, now you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re twice as hurt! If you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re searching for treasure, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s become twice as valuable, and so on.<br/><br/>* What\xe2\u20ac\u2122s in it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pockets? Your character has something in his pocket that can prove to be of great assistance. What is it?<br/><br/>* Masquerade! For the rest of this session, all players swap characters. This does not include the game master. Give your character sheet to the player at your right. <br/><br/>* Slow motion. This scene is played in slow motion. All players must speak calmly, using slow, tempered movements. Since it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s slow-mo, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll notice a lot of details which would otherwise pass unseen. Any player may at any time interrupt the scene to describe a seemingly inconsequential detail. Afterwards, every player around the table must add another detail before the scene may continue. <br/><br/>* In the mirror. Play the rest of this scene on the B-side of Itra\xc2\xb4s City, where everything is opposite. How are the characters on the A-side affected by this scene?<br/><br/>* Falling dream. Your character falls. Why and how?<br/><br/>* Mood change. The characters suddenly change mood. Explain what mood they are now in, and use this for the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>* Bird\xc2\xb4s eye view. Play the scene as if seen from above.<br/><br/>* Inner monologue. The next five minutes all characters are to think out loud. To show that one has an inner monologue, the players get up from their chair. <br/><br/>* The thought bubble. A thought bubble appears over the head of an NPC. It may be real or metaphorical. Everyone may see what the person is thinking. You decide what that is. <br/><br/>Most of the cards above have been extensively play tested. Mr. Haaken Lid has developed some new ones, which have not yet been put to the test. They are not included here. The chance cards above preceded the resolution cards in the game\xe2\u20ac\u2122s development. We will include Matthijs\xc2\xb4resolution cards as the \xe2\u20ac\u0153conflict mechanic\xe2\u20ac\x9d of the game. The chance cards are more or less \xe2\u20ac\u0153spice\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and not quite as integral to the game\xe2\u20ac\u2122s structure. Play tests have demonstrated that they are an effective way of grooming players into taking more responsibility for narrating/seizing more power in narration, and also for introducing a certain flexibility of thought and action fitting the setting. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s my humble opinion, anyhow\xe2\u20ac\xa6 Some play testers have voiced the worry that Matthijs\xc2\xb4 resolution cards may make the chance cards redundant. I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t had an opportunity to test them yet, as I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been in South America the past seven months, but I hope we can keep both. That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the plan. Many thanks to Matthijs for the resolution cards (finally getting in place the one thing the game lacked sorely; a functioning, albeit original, resolution mechanic) and to both his and Haaken Lid\xe2\u20ac\u2122s groups for continuous play tests, reports, support and enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Now Bogot\xc3\xa1 beckons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88794/#Comment_88794" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T13:29:13+00:00" title="August 19, 2007  1:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88799/#Comment_88799" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T14:53:45+00:00" title="August 19, 2007  2:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2007 2:54PM by olepeder.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>That's pretty awesome.</blockquote>\nCheers.<br/><br/>I translated Haaken\xc2\xb4s cards today. Few of them have been rigourously tested, but I assume they\xc2\xb4ll work just fine. Many are very film-inspired, since his Itras-campaign is about a film studio:<br/><br/>* Babel. The rest of the dialogue in the scene is played out in a<br/>nonsensical language which all the characters can understand, but none<br/>of the players.<br/><br/>* Shift of status. High becomes low and low becomes high. All<br/>status-relations in the scene are turned upside down. It may happen<br/>suddenly or slowly, but the characters must have changed status before<br/>the scene is over.<br/><br/>* Fast forward. This scene happens extra fast. Talk quickly, maybe<br/>with Mickey Mouse voices, and don\xc2\xb4t hesitate to use slapstick humour.<br/><br/>* Black and white. This scene is in black and white. All colours<br/>disappear, and there is no longer room for nuance. Everything is<br/>either good or bad, virtuous or evil.<br/><br/>* Silent movie. The rest of the action this scene is only to be<br/>described. No dialogue is permitted. If there is pen and paper<br/>available, the players can use text posters for dialogue, but the<br/>spoken word is forbidden.<br/><br/>* Pantomime. The players get up from the table and mime the rest of<br/>the scene without saying a word. The scene is over when at least to<br/>players have sat down again.<br/><br/>* Musical. The rest of the scene is a musical. The characters (and the<br/>players) must sing and dance.<br/><br/>* Cross editing. You can cross cut between this scene and another. The<br/>other sceen can happen at the same time, or in another time and place.<br/>You decide who\xc2\xb4s in the other scene and when to cut back and forth.<br/><br/>* The advisers. Two advisers appear on each shoulder of one of the<br/>persons present in the scene. Time stops while they try to convince<br/>the person of their (opposing) sides to some dilemma. Choose who will<br/>be given advice and which two players will control each advisor.<br/><br/>* Dream. Someone wakes up from a dream. Who is it? Was the previous<br/>scene only a fantasy, or was it real?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
