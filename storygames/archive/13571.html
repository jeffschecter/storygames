Otherwise, GMs compelling PCs are from an unlimited bank.

You can only tag once per scope in a roll, so no matter how many fate points the GM has to bring to bear, eventually she's going to need to draw on the opposition (player characters in this case) aspects and that means they will get paid for the tag. Add to that the fact that characters have limited fate points no matter what the GM can bring to bear in other contexts, and that means that an NPC (including a space craft) in a fight still has a limited number.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306575/#Comment_306575" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T07:24:33+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  7:24AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 2, 2011 7:25AM by agony.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played PTA in 2 years so sorry for the confusion but the player spending in that does fuel the GM's spending as half get pumped back into his pool as Jason said.

However, this quote confuses me:\n<blockquote>eventually she's going to need to draw on the opposition (player characters in this case) aspects and that means they will get paid for the tag.</blockquote>\nI was not aware when you tag someone's aspect they get paid for the tag.  I know compels work that way but I can't find anywhere in the Fate economy section of Diaspora where it states you give the Fate point to the player if you tag their aspect.  <br/><br/>My main concern and why I started this thread is that I can only rely on my own judgment on the spur of the moment as well as the table's when deciding if I should tag an aspect.  I tagged a ship's "Nuclear torpedos" aspect in two separate rounds of ship combat last time we played and the players didn't like this.  I did so because the fight was lop-sided and I was trying to maintain pacing.  They didn't think it was right that I could tag aspects basically every single round if I wanted to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306576/#Comment_306576" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T07:36:19+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  7:36AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would really appreciate the <i>FATE</i> system a lot more if there were some curb on the GM's currency, a la PTA.

I can tag my or your aspect repeatedly every other round in combat and the only thing holding me back is my own judgment (I don't want to use the term fiat).  I know I can't tag the same aspect or another aspect of the same scope in each individual roll, but there's nothing stopping me from tagging the same aspect every round.  <br/><br/>My players expressed uneasiness with this as I tagged the same aspect on two consecutive rolls.  I did this because I felt the conflict was turning against the NPC too quickly and I felt I needed to beef up my roll for pacing purposes.  My players trust me as a GM (we've been story-gaming together for 4 years and playing trad games together for somewhere around 12 years) but they still thought that was strange and it shouldn't be that way.  <br/><br/>The GM having unlimited Fate points for Compells makes sense and is awesome, but for tagging aspects it seems a bit wrong.

I've run some very successful scenes with many NPCs giving them no fate points and playing only with fate points acquired when the players compel or tag them, too. When I play them this way I usually have one pool for all the NPCs.<br/><br/>Ships are first class characters though -- give them five always.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
