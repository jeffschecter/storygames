The game was two players (them) and one GM (me).  Interestingly, they chose, through narration, to make the set-up "amnesia lite" - Clinton's guy had an apartment and a passport, they had tons of cash socked away, and this choice didn't really harm play at all.  It was just different.  <br/><br/>I've noticed that it can be a real challenge for the GM/s to maintain an appropriately tense pacing, and to directly provide adversity - my role as a GM has been essentially passive, and I'd like some advice on how to punch up my involvement in the game.  <br/><br/>We all observed that the dice favor general success, and true hardship was pretty rare.  We were playing that injury meant tossing the best die in your roll, which is about as harsh as you can get, and it still wasn't very often that they had to make really hard choices about allocation.  Also, Clinton noted that Reveal is the Psi Run "dump stat", because it is structured so that allocating a bad die only extends the game.  One cool suggestion to try out would be to adjust Reveal so that low or high causes flashbacks, and a middlin' roll has no effect (Clinton's idea).  <br/><br/>Still, we had a fun, tight game that took the Runners from Herndon Virginia to Cairo by way of a crashed Airbus A340 in Tenerife, dodgy smugglers speed-boating them to Morocco, all kinds of craziness as per usual with <i>Psi Run.</i>  The game is great, but there's definite room for tightening and strong GM advice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104135/#Comment_104135" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T08:59:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  8:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">but there's definite room for tightening and strong GM advice.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what Michael and I were talking about while running demos of Psi Run at a local con this weekend.  But I'm still convinced that just because the rules have taken the "main" adversity (the Chasers) out of the GM's hands, that <i>every other</i> kind of conflict is still available.  What the game needs is a list (or something) of common kinds of scenes and/or conflicts that the GM can apply to the story at hand.  This list-thing should also be able to help the GM direct the pacing and arc of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany scenes are easy for me to frame based on Vincent's "follow the low roll" advice.  But others (especially in the beginning) are more difficult.  I am slowly learning to even more aggressively frame scenes, a la Acts of Evil.  I just feel like there needs to be some resource for the GM to tap into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104137/#Comment_104137" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T09:02:01+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  9:02AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Yeah, I love Psi Run, so sue me.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<i>Psi Run</i> loves you, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104139/#Comment_104139" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T09:07:30+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  9:07AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I'm unfamiliar with "follow the low roll" - can you spell this out for me?<br><br>Also, give me an example of something that would be on that list you are envisioning.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104142/#Comment_104142" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T09:34:36+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  9:34AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume you can't get Psi Run at this point?

Now, instead of a simple "Success" or "Failure", I've changed it to read "Success, and...", "Success", "Success, but...", and "No Success". The "Success, and..." allows the character to succeed at the stated goal, as well as achieve some type of extra advantage. As an example, a character succeeds at 'borrowing' a get away car, and then discovers bag full of money hidden in the back seat. Now the characters have a car and money to survive on. "Success, but..." adds a complication of some sort. For example, the above character succeeds at stealing the car, but a police car happens by as the characters speed away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth situations help to push the characters, and the story, forward. And yet, while both examples were successes, they both help to develop future conflicts. What's the story with the money in the car? Who might be looking for it now that it's gone? How will the characters respond to the cops? Will the cops give chase?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I'm trying, something that might cut down on REVEAL being a die dump is to give tokens to the players if their narration of a REVEAL helps to keep the characters' stories tied together in some way. Tokens may be traded in for things like re-rolling one die, helping another character (by giving them a bonus die), shaking off an Injury, or to narrate another character's Success (and..., but...) or Failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also using a suggestion I happened upon elsewhere: When a 1-2 is placed on the PSI Category, that player must re-roll on the SAFETY Category. It hasn't really added much in the way of Injuries, but it does help to show that the characters might actually hurt themselves with their own abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that the characters have lost their memories works great toward leading the fiction. Just because a player chose four questions, doesn't mean that's all the character can't remember. Use the Mountain Witch trick:<br/>\n<br/>\n"As you run across the street to escape your pursuers someone calls out to you, with what sounds to be some familiarity. Who is it? What does he or she want?"<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I'd direct these at one person, but generally, I'd just throw it out there and let anybody run with it. These smaller Reveals proved to be a big help in keeping the game going; it helps with character development as well.  And it gave me a bit of control over the game's fiction, if only minimally.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Michael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104500/#Comment_104500" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T03:35:45+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  3:35AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Jason, sorry to chime in so late, but Psi Run was super-fun!<br><br>I didn't feel like the dice were giving me as much "general success" as you guys apparently were.

Then each player rolls 1d6. The player with the high die is able to place the dice as he sees fit and gains narrative authority. Another player might use a token to re-roll a die, or possibly take over some of the authorship, but for the most part the high die has the table for that conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't actually what I'm looking for, but it'll make a great first step toward figuring out some rules for scene framing and narrative authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies Chris_Moore and michael-cloud if I'm hacking up your baby too much.

Hopefully I'll have at least three other players show up for game night. What I'm looking to do is have two players act as Runners and the third play the Chaser. That's why I'm considering doing all the dice rolling and then having the others roll initiative for narrative control. I'm interested in seeing what happens when the Chaser can decide the outcome of the dice. I'll even go so far as to throw the Mountain Witch trick at the player controlling the Chaser, allowing him to narrate scenes outside of conflicts as well. What if the Chaser had abilities as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael-cloud" title="michael-cloud"><img alt="michael-cloud" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael-cloud">michael-cloud</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104962/#Comment_104962" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T06:25:37+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  6:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted Buy: Malthusian~ ...
