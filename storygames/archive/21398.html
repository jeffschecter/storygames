I'm polling you for clever ideas and suggestions.<br/><br/>I've been asked to run a one-shot for a couple of gamers who've never had a chance to play in a game together.<br/><br/>They are "trad" gamers, as far as I know (I think they only play D&amp;D5E), and fairly hardcore about it. They have a regular ongoing D&amp;D campaign. I think they're pretty willing to try something different in this case, however.<br/><br/>We are going to be able to spend a long evening together, so we potentially have up to 5-6 hours. I *may* be able to get some setup/info from them beforehand, but not very much.<br/><br/>What would be really fun, in your opinion? What game would you run?<br/><br/>Do you have a fictional scenario in mind?<br/><br/>How do you set things up?<br/><br/>Any and all ideas are welcome. Feel free to brainstorm here!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468520/#Comment_468520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-19T14:15:00+00:00" title="December 19, 2017  2:15PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something like <i>Theatrix</i> might work for letting them dip their toes into story gaming.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, I'd recommend going whole hog. I've never had trouble introducing traditional gamers to story games--and in my experience so far they usually really enjoy them too. For games with baked-in themes, the game might depend on their taste. Perhaps <i>Dungeon World</i> for offering a familiar dungeon crawl but with new-but-still-crunchy rules? What about <i>Wushu</i> for some crazy action movie flavour? Or pick <i>Muse</i>, <i>Musette</i>, <i>Universalis </i>or <i>Archipelago </i>and let them choose the story spontaneously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468523/#Comment_468523" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-19T15:20:48+00:00" title="December 19, 2017  3:20PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed! I think I can safely pick any of my favourite games. What I'm really hoping for out of this thread is:<br/><br/>a) Some good thoughts on a particular setup or scenario. Many "story games" either need a specific seed concept or a scenario/premise. <br/><br/>A lot of my favourite games really shine after 2-4 sessions; they would need some special premise or modification to run well as a one-shot.<br/><br/>For instance, if I want to run <i>Dungeon World</i>, I'd need some scenario/concept.<br/><br/>b) Something that works well with just GM+2 players. Again, a lot of great games need more than 3 to really work. If you consider the games we played recently - <i>A Taste for Murder</i>, and <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> - and they would probably be great, but I think 3 players is not enough. Same goes for <i>The King is Dead</i>  - all these games shine at 4-5 players (and sometimes more).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468525/#Comment_468525" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-19T17:57:55+00:00" title="December 19, 2017  5:57PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd go with something simple yet robust, that delivers a good payoff quickly.<br/><br/>Personally, a game that I would pick could well be <i>Fables of Camelot</i>. The subject matter is both juicy and widely accessible, as most people can get into Arthurian romance. It's also sufficiently GM-led to support all sorts of players, and it's mechanically sharp, making for interesting play. Suits well for one-shots, and shines with all player counts. All sorts of little details that make it well-suited for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>There are other games with similarly favourable accessibility/punch ratios for one-shots with two players, so that's what I would look at. Depends on what you're adept with - I might recommend <i>Space Rat</i>, for instance, but if it isn't in your oeuvre yet, you might not care to check it out just for this. Go with something you already know.<br/><br/>One more: <i>Trollbabe</i>. That one's probably quite familiar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468526/#Comment_468526" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-19T19:18:39+00:00" title="December 19, 2017  7:18PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good suggestions, Eero!<br/><br/><i>Fables of Camelot</i> keeps coming up when it's time for this kind of request, but I'm embarassed to say I cannot figure out how to run it from the rules I've read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468527/#Comment_468527" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-19T19:49:47+00:00" title="December 19, 2017  7:49PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see that, the English text from my blog's not really a complete game text as much as a quick reference outline.

That segues into something I've been thinking about doing anyway: it might be interesting to set up bit of a "Finnish rpg jukebox" selection and see if foreigners would like to try them out online, with a native GM/facilitator to translate. There are a few - let's say half a dozen - Finnish rpgs that are of internationally relevant quality; some are better than the best competitor in their niche. Perhaps I'll see about doing something active along these lines at some point.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468528/#Comment_468528" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-19T20:07:00+00:00" title="December 19, 2017  8:07PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to participate in that, and I know a few other folks.<br/><br/>How would this be done, and when/in what time frame?<br/><br/><br/>In the meantime, I welcome your suggestions, Story Games people!<br/><br/>One of my ideas is taking the "Boomtown" Fiasco playset, generating a starting map, and then reimagining it in a post-apocalyptic light and playing it with Apocalypse World's rules.

For one-shot events I usually have more people attending. That said, I'm sure there's a lot you can do...<br/><br/><i>Follow</i> and <i>The Quiet Year</i> are two great one-shot games which are recommended for 2-4 players, making 3 the happy middle. <i>Microscope</i> will probably shine with 3 players, too.<br/><br/>Three is also a good number for <i>Kingdom</i> (though I slightly prefer four) and, while not strictly one-shot technically, I think you have enough time to get a good session out of it.<br/><br/>It's a sufficient number of players for <i>Society of Dreamers</i>, which is a great game, and again you seem to have enough time.<br/><br/>Three is a perfectly OK number for playing <i>Ribbon Drive</i>, if you can get people on-board with preparing playlists. That's a game I love.<br/><br/>It's a legit number of players for <i>Montsegur 1244</i>.<br/><br/>Three is also my favorite number for playing <i>Shock: Social Science Fiction</i> - as more players usually makes it hard for me to actually wrap it up as the one-shot it's supposed to be.<br/><br/>Three is also enough for playing <i>Spione</i>, though familiarity with the subject matter (a read of the essay part, say) is probably preferable, and keeping it to a one-shot requires selecting specific characters (higher card number, fewer connected NPCs, preferably spying for CIA or KGB).<br/><br/>You can play <i>Contenders</i>, though I don't warrant one-shot.<br/><br/>I've played <i>Swords Without Master</i> with a group of three: in terms of fidelity to its core reference literature, that's the sweet spot - even though some rules seem to run more smoothly with a group of four.<br/><br/><i>Lovecraftesque</i> has both the advantage and the disadvantage of a very familiar subject matter for RPG geeks.<br/><br/><i>Downfall</i> is a one-shot game for exactly three - unfortunately, I haven't played it yet. <i>The Temple</i>, ditto (except not so strictly one-shot).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468537/#Comment_468537" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-20T02:26:10+00:00" title="December 20, 2017  2:26AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and people from a strictly "trad" RPG background sometimes react really well to <i>On Mighty Thews</i>, which also works well for three (same reason as SWM).<br/><br/>And isn't <i>While the World Ends</i> by <a href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">@Wilhelm</a> a 3-player game?<br/><br/>Which reminds me: 3 is also good for <i>Okult</i>, and <i>Okult</i> is one notch above great!
