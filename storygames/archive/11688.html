The pleasure people derive from your rules in play is a function of their elegance and clarity coupled with these people's own ability to enjoy their friend's company and collaborate in a functional way. <br/><br/>If you want your game to be <i>funny</i>, that's a viable design goal. You can put procedures in place that will push game play toward humorous situations, just like you can write a game designed to model an abusive relationship, but there's nothing you can write down that will automatically make it fun, by any given definition of fun. <br/><br/>So if you want your game to be fun, know what you want and write it really well and make sure it is absolutely bullet-proof. Good players will take care of the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260639/#Comment_260639" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T05:54:38+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  5:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            if there's something you want to happen at the table, and it's not happening - or not as often as you want - game design may be able to produce it.<br/><br/>I don't like games that feel like they started from "let's design a game"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260648/#Comment_260648" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T06:50:27+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  6:50AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 7:31AM by TylerT.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            my goal is to produce something compelling for the intended audience. <br/>\n<br/>\nafter reading the linked post i would guess their point is.

Koster delivers, in fairly plain language, a vision for the design of games that illuminate the human condition. <br/><br/>But my big take-away from A Theory of Fun for Game Design wasn't so much the theory as it was Koster's process of carefully defining "fun" for himself. Seeing the work he does of splitting various enjoyments (like schadenfreude) off from "fun" as tangential to his own focus is what I think is most worthwhile about the book.

Game design is about <i>transmitting guidelines that structure the behavior of players in interesting ways.</i> Whether it's fun or not in practice, the designer only has so much control over.  Honestly, you only have so much control over whether people realize your vision either.  I honestly think we need to have more of a "the designer is dead" backlash in roleplaying design, but that's a different issue (basically, the designer doesn't fucking matter once you put a text in people's hands and they're ready to play).  But ideally, what you're trying to do is communicate ideas about play that get people to adjust their practices to be more-or-less similar to the structures that you've put into place at your own table when running the same game (assuming you've done playtesting and are trying to replicate the best experiences, otherwise it's just an abstract exercise based on imagined structures or an exploratory thing based on throwing some guidelines down and seeing what happens).<br/><br/>Actually, check that.  Design is always a mixture of trying to 1) replicate certain structures / types of experiences and 2) setting up structures that will generate unknown kinds of experiences.

But to leave it at the word fun doesn't give enough information about any specific activity that we might call gaming as to whether or not you and your friends might find it fun. It also suggests that maybe, just maybe, I as a game designer haven't thought about why the game should be fun, or who the game should be fun for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a very personal level*, if you're not having fun, by your own definition of it, you shouldn't be playing the game. If you don't think the game you're writing will be fun, by your own definition of it, then you shouldn't be writing the game. But try to give more detail, not by writing an essay on what fun means, but by explaining the sorts of things your game does that are "fun", thus allowing people to make more informed decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n*said personal level doesn't acknowledge the validity of calling something a game if it's not fun by any definition. This doesn't mean that the activity isn't fulfilling and worthwhile in some other fashion, but I don't think the activity has any claim to being called a game at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260823/#Comment_260823" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T22:48:32+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 10:48PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2010 10:48PM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently Jared said this in a different thread, that I didn't read, a few days ago:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

Um, can you be more specific, please?<br><br>On the other hand, it is entirely possible to make a game that is not fun, and removing non-fun elements of your game comes pretty close to designing a fun experience (because you are un-designing an un-fun experience, if you will), even though any rule that is un-fun for everybody all the time (like "stab yourself in the eye when you roll a 1") is pretty ridiculous, so one-man's-trash caveat and all that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260828/#Comment_260828" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T23:18:03+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 11:18PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I want to see a Paul Czege game that works on schadenfreude.... maybe that's just MLwM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260832/#Comment_260832" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T23:49:52+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 11:49PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Now I want to see a Paul Czege game that works on schadenfreude.... maybe that's just MLwM.</blockquote>\nA Paul Czege games that works on schadenfreude?<br><br>Next you'll be asking for a Luke Crane game that focusing on character motivations, or a Vincent Baker game with clever die mechanics.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.
