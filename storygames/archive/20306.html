A hyper-nonlinear, slightly surreal, hyperviolent game in the style of Naked Lunch or Pulp Fiction, or (I am given to believe, although I haven't read it yet) Palahniuk's Invisible Monsters Remix. It would be highly non-sequential, the scenes not anchored in a timeline but rather just existing on their own. The objective would to create a raw, naked aesthetic rather than a gripping, compelling story.<br/><br/>I described it thus to my friend:<br/>"I want to run a game that begins in medias res. You see characters getting high, getting shot, getting shitfaced, getting laid, getting in shit way above their heads, getting dumped. No interest in narrative continuity, we jump forwards and backwards in time, if stuff overlaps or contradicts that's fine. It's full of MDMA and five-headed demons and little angel-birds that speak to you your dreams and boys that choke you to death as you have sex with them and entrails scattered over just-washed carpets.<br/>"A massive cast of characters, you can play any or none of them, that's cool. Open with a bang: who's dead, who's vomiting into their Happy Meal, who on the floor in convulsions? No (or very little) why, no how, just Who and What and Where. And then we play out that scene until one of us feels like Okay Let's End This Here and then we Jump to a different point in time somewhere. And then we make new characters or play with one of the cast-members already established, that's cool, I don't care, and now where are we and where's the guy with the bag of severed legs going?"<br/><br/>So I was struggling with mechanics: specifically, scene-framing and character ownership. The traditional method of scene framing, as I understand it, is some variation on the GM saying "Okay, what do you do? You go to the barbershop? Right, so Dan's there and you surprised him in the act of munching on a live pig. What do you do?" Sometimes players get some agency over scene-framing, but that's the gist of it. Unfortunately, this traditional method of scene framing relies mainly on causality, on the (explicit or implicit) "What do you do now?" question. And causality is precisely the thing I'm trying to avoid. (I'm also kind of thinking about avoiding a GM role framing scenes, as well, because then the game becomes the GM's private strangeness-fantasy as opposed to a collaborative "hey, guys, what if this cool thing happened?")<br/><br/>The other element I want the game to be free from is the idea of player-character ownership. Everybody plays multiple characters, not one. No character belongs to anybody: it's all just this pool of dramatis persone anybody can draw from.<br/><br/>So here's what I've come up with so far. <br/><br/>No GM. Before every scene everybody puts some papers into a hat that describe characters, objects, a location, and (this is important) a "when XYZ occurs". Oftentimes a character/object/location will be taken from earlier. Each scene one person is chosen to be the 'scene-setter'. The scene-setter describes the scene, using the objects thrown into the hat. Doesn't have to use all of them in the scene-setting, not yet.<br/><br/>So lemme illustrate with an example:<br/>So maybe everybody throws in "The lumberjack from last scene", "Bloody mangled fingers", "A chicken", "Miss Pussycat", "When somebody vomits", and "When something shatters". It's my turn to be the scene-setter, so I get to say "So the lumberjack and Miss Pussycat are at the back of Joe's mansion, in the hot tub with you, the lumberjack is fingering Miss Pussycat underneath the water surface but he's also screaming, 'Shit, shit, why are there razorblades down there?' and she's laughing, and his hands are all cut up when he takes it out of the water, and the green neon lights in the library beside you are flickering out." I haven't used the 'chicken' yet, and the two "When..." papers have been completely ignored thus far.<br/><br/>Then everybody picks characters, either from the list of characters already in the scene (the lumberjack or Miss Pussycat) or from the dramatis personae already established in previous scenes, and introduces them. ("So Jackie walks into the backyard with a bloody katana, and yells 'Which one of you motherf---ers stole my ma's cocaine?' and she looks like business.")<br/><br/>And then everybody roleplays out the scene. Conflicts are resolved by whoever's /not/ involved in the conflict ("yeah, I think the lumberjack wins the game of whist"), and when somebody feels like it, they can introduce that chicken we've established and roleplay for it.<br/><br/>When all the elements of the game have come into play (in this case, "a chicken") and when the "When..." papers have come to frutition (Jackie's just punched Miss Pussycat in the shoulder and something's definitely cracked/smashed, and the lumberjack's too drunk to do anything except vomit into the hot tub), then everybody can keep playing as normal, except AT ANY POINT somebody can yell "CUT!" and it doesn't matter if we were in the middle of a great bit of dialogue, or in the middle of Jackie's player describing in pornographic detail how she's skewering Miss Pussycat, or whatever, we all stop playing. Period.<br/><br/>And then we write down a bunch of questions that have been begged during the roleplay ("Who stole Jackie's mum's cocaine?", "Did Miss Pussycat survive being skewered?", "the lumberjack mentioned he was reeeeally intimate with Joe. What'd he mean?"). And then we move to the next scene, and the process repeats, but now we've got some more objects and characters to include in future scenes.<br/><br/><br/>So, essentially, my proposed, brewed-in-about-30-minutes draft-system's pretty freeform-narrativist. I'm not sure whether this would work, though. Maybe a different system that provides more room for off-the-hookery (like, you can chip in two Drama Points to  Especially I'd be interested in a system that's a bit more devoted to answering the questions-that-have-been begged.<br/><br/>I dunno. I feel like integrating further narrativist system conceits would be good to give this game a bit more structure instead of having it all be so very vague. Conflict resolution especially bugs me because it feels really calvinball.<br/><br/>Whaddaya think, story-gamers? Any input would be really appreciated here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447584/#Comment_447584" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T19:00:27+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  7:00PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not ready to answer your question yet, but my first thought is about the "unreliable narrator" - a technique often used in postmodern fiction.  I consider roleplaying games to be a specifically postmodern medium, and you've touched on one more way to embody the qualities of that literary genre.<br/><br/>Basically: Because everyone has their own point of view, Because memory is not infallible, Because interpretations of events are dependent on ego, Because people often lie - even to themselves, and Because people sometimes get so messed up they remember things that are totally fucking impossible... There's no need to treat anyone's narrative as being sacrosanct.<br/><br/>There is no Master Narrative.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447586/#Comment_447586" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T19:22:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  7:22PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like Universalis would be interesting in this context.

You (almost) only know what your PC knows, and you only worry about that... the invisible GM will worry about the rest, the story, the big picture... not you... you CAN'T even if you wanted to. You are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Player</span>.<br/><br/>Then other structures take care of introducing unexpected stuff. But instead of tables of random CONTENT, I use two tables of random SHAPES.<br/>One (Soft Opposition) only affects the fiction, while the other (Hard Opposition) has also specific mechanical effects.<br/><br/>As an example here is the Soft Opposition table from the FateLess book...<br/><br/>1) The situation gets sticky<br/>Your circumstances worsen, someone or something becomes more hostile, or appears now and is already hostile; either way it ACTS against you. It tries.<br/><br/>2) Your weakness shows<br/>One of your Aspects causes a BIG PROBLEM for some reason. Doesn\u2019t count as Compel.<br/><br/>3) Shit hits the fan<br/>Something important is broken or lost. Someone important (NPC) is apprehended or seriously wounded or dangerously separated from the PCs. Or you deplete an important resource you might need right now or in the near future (ammo, food, drugs, etc).<br/><br/>4) Something wicked this way comes<br/>You perceive or are told about something BAD that is happening, or about to happen, here or nearby or somewhere else (but is immediately relevant).<br/><br/>5) Cut Out<br/>Something happens to isolate your PC from her allies or an important resource. This does not count as a Compel.<br/><br/>6) The Ball Drops<br/>Same as \u201cThe situation gets sticky\u201d but the thing acting against you succeeds in its intent for the current action. <br/></blockquote>\nThis way you inject a random SHAPE that the players will have to fill with actual CONTENT.<br/>It has enough structure so that they Players are not feeling like they are creating a problem for themselves, it just requires that some color be applied to it to make it fit in the current fiction.<br/>&gt;_&lt;&lt;/p&gt;<br/><br/>I think you could use some of this and skip the "writing stuff on papers" part (it kinda slows down the game). Or perhaps the part that should be written is the table of shapes. Along with Aslf's unreliable narrator idea, this could work wonders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RushWright" title="RushWright"><img alt="RushWright" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RushWright">RushWright</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447588/#Comment_447588" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-03T19:26:44+00:00" title="August  3, 2015  7:26PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting observation, Aslf. That puts into words quite well what I'm trying to accomplish here.<br/><br/>At the same time, I'm a bit antsy about the idea of skewering narrative altogether. The balance I'm considering (and have no real idea how to achieve) is between me not wanting a Master Narrative and me also wanting the game to be greater than the sum of its scenes. Otherwise it not surreal so much as simply nonsensical. The conventional way to elevate a story beyond the sum of its scenes is to string them together along a certain thematic or narrative common thread. But a narrative common thread is clearly right out the window, and a thematic common thread... well, I'm also antsy about the idea of that being somehow mechanically codified.<br/><br/>Hmm. It'd have to be a hell of a weird Microscope hack, because Microscope is all about contextualizing a scene within a larger narrative, and that's precisely the opposite of what I'm trying to achieve here. Universalis, however - I can see that working, although I haven't looked at the system in years.

Or, at any rate, I don't like the idea of the players being privy to the knowledge of whose reality this is and whether or not something's real. At least, not in the mechanics.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble articulating why, apart from the fact that in the films, we aren't privy to these things, we have to figure them out for ourselves. It makes more sense to me that every scene is taken totally straight, without the wink-wink nudge-nudge "this is totally postmodern because we've got mechanics to determine how real everything is" thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's not what you're suggesting, though. Perhaps all of what you're talking about could be somehow buried "under the hood" so it's not a mechanical thing so much as an implication, or something.<br/><br/>2097: Really? I mean, the Fiasco pregame is a good fit for determining things and their relationships to one another. But Fiasco in general is supposed to be a pretty linear(ish) game centered around a very specific variety of plots.<br/><br/>The scene-setting thing from my draft system in the original post was kinda based off Fiasco, though. But all the other stuff that's neither pre-game nor scene-setting, I don't know how that would fit.<br/><br/>BeePeeGee: Yeah, combining the two could be neato. I want to trust that the charcters are capable of coming up with loads of crazy s--t on their own without the help of random generators, but random rolls could make a wonderful AW-style Hard Move generator. Yeah, I think I like that, actually.<br/><br/>Antesinecurist: Yeeeah. I like what you're doing in theory. I'm... not sure what else to say apart from, that looks unwieldy and kind of cool.

That's never been a surprise or shock. All the films that you cited are films that I truly and deeply enjoy. However, the reason that I enjoy them is that they create an experience for me to sublimate into. I literally don't have to care about why I am in a given or particular scene as it's sort of implied that at least the filmmaker did at some point, or the author. I'm there for the experience.<br/><br/>As a player, however, I am at least in theory engaged with the act of creation. As a creator, I need to have a reason for what I'm putting up on the screen \u2013 even (maybe especially) if it's the shared narrative screen of myself and the other people at the table. I have to have actual and sensible investment in order to feel gratified in that act of creation.<br/><br/>There's no reason for me to care about anything that I might put into this game as a player. Because there's a reason for me to care about anything, there's no reason for anyone to care about the input of anyone else at the table.<br/><br/>That's where the truly fatal toxin sets in, because if no one cares about the input of anyone else at the table, you have no shared experience. Absent the idea of continuity, there is no shared experience.<br/><br/>I don't need a game to simulate posting to Twitter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447626/#Comment_447626" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-05T05:02:45+00:00" title="August  5, 2015  5:02AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we've had so many games of Fiasco where it's like "OK, cool!

You see, in surrealist cinema, one of the most often used tricks to keep "coherence" is using and recycling a Symbol, adding more and more layers of emotion and concepts to it until it becomes a concept itself. <br/><br/>So, for the rest of the scenes you can go non-sequitur and it really won't matter if the theme becomes unified through the symbol. The Symbol can be of course, anything: from an object, insect or animal, to a piece of music or a phrase. It may suggest some meaning by itself, but eventually the added layers of meaning will turn it into something unique.<br/><br/>Players framing the scene can include the Symbol at anytime, but the experience will certainly be more rewarding if it's apparition is syncronized with the moment the scene gains a meaning and provokes a certain emotion in the players. In fact, it can be a sort of signal used by a player to mean "Now the scene is making me feel something, and I want to share it with you, so please pay attention to this part"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447632/#Comment_447632" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-05T19:31:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2015  7:31PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1.

Your points are well made, folks. I'd initially intended the game to be a sort of a Dada thing: nothing has any meaning, nothing has any context, we simply observe the characters being involved in strange and f---ed up stuff. The objective is to revel in the sheer perversity of it all. But then I realized, yeah, what you described so well SquidLord. Why are we playing the game? We care about the aesthetic clearly, but a game can't live on aesthetic alone.<br/><br/>So here's some reasons why we might care about the game:<br/>* We care about some type of plot(s) occuring. This is probably the most problematic to execute, because the plot will necessarily be obscured by the fundamental narrative conceit of the game (namely, the nonlinearity). Probably it would be easier to outright ignore the "plot" and let it occur naturally.<br/>* We care about the characters, their growths, their successes. I'm envisioning two ways this could go: a Gamist-type struggle in which each player fights to bring to frutition the goals of their PCs, or a Nar/Sim thing where the aim is simply to explore what happens when the world is brought into conflict with itself.<br/>* We care about something entirely different and meta-related. This is exciting to me, although I'm not sure it's sustainable on its own. I was envisioning, perhaps, not a gamist struggle in the fiction itself, but outside it. So perhaps it may be advantageous to (for example) make one's own characters as miserable and unsuccessful as possible to gain "win-tokens". Or, more interestingly, it would be cool if you gained "win-tokens" when you did something to highlight and play off of other players' fictional advances. So that it's advantageous to go "oh yeah, that's cool! And then what if..."<br/><br/>I dunno, I'm just blurting stuff out at this stage. Maybe it's all rubbish, maybe not, maybe there's something better that I hadn't conceived of. Holler back, y'all. I've never done this kind of story-gamey design before and so I've no idea what I'm doing.<br/><br/>The symbols thing is fascinating, yeah. Are you envisioning this as a standalone, "this by itself could be enough to carry the game" thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447641/#Comment_447641" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-05T21:03:52+00:00" title="August  5, 2015  9:03PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rush, I think you might have the relatively common problem of approaching the design from the wrong end. At this point you actually don't have any idea of what to be designing toward, and without a design goal there is no design methodology. That's no way to succeed.<br/><br/>So let's turn the whole thing around.<br/><br/>Describe to me how you envision this being actually played. Write me out a script of what play should look like. Once you do that, a lot of these questions will answer themselves for you, which is always the best result.<br/><br/>The other thing to consider in parallel is whether or not this "game" actually provide something that no other game with more established presence in the market does at least as well. For instance, a lot of your description makes me think of <b>Microscope</b> played in a very gonzo style. It's inherently nonlinear. The only things that are important are what the Players decide are important enough to either put on the Palette or to make a Focus (or which are interesting enough to everyone to simply come up regularly without any mechanical leverage). The Players themselves decide on what qualifies as successes or failures. If your concept doesn't deliver anything beyond and above what Microscope does, maybe what you need to think about is whether or not it really is an actual game or whether it might be better served as being implemented as a <b>Microscope</b> hack. Or a <b>Kingdom</b> hack. Or even a <b><a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/about.html" rel="nofollow">Capes</a></b> hack.<br/><br/>This is the killing-your-darlings portion of the early game development stages. Sometimes you have to strangle them in the crib to sort out the really good, juicy organs to salvage for something else later. It's hard \u2013 but oh so rewarding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447656/#Comment_447656" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-06T07:42:13+00:00" title="August  6, 2015  7:42AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2015 9:08AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course a game can live on aesthetic alone, it's just going to be a pretty niche game. Players who like the aesthetic enough will like the game.<br/><br/>The question is, can you design a game that does a better job of producing that aesthetic than a bunch of aesthetically-motivated players just riffing on whatever. It seems like an achievable goal: the Surrealists came up with all sorts of games and activities designed to produce surrealism, after all, and many of them are quite fun.<br/><br/>This is basically an echo of what SquidLord is saying, which is also a thought I had earlier but didn't bother expressing -- do you need a new game, or do you just need players who are interested in this aesthetic? I can easily imagine running a game of Don't Rest Your Head that is almost exactly like your initial description of play; though if I wanted Pulp Fiction, then Fiasco seems a better fit (that movie is non-linear in presentation but it has a pretty clear narrative.) A Penny For My Thoughts could also very easily adapt to this mode of narrative, seeing as it is already disjointed and amnesiac/non-linear in presentation.<br/><br/>All these games also provide 'other things' to hang the aesthetic on, which is important -- particularly for something Dadaist, which is after all an incredibly reactive and contrarian/destructive aesthetic. Dadaism without a narrative or structure to react <i>against</i> is going to be pretty incoherent, but the nature of that narrative/structure itself might not be that important.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RushWright" title="RushWright"><img alt="RushWright" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RushWright">RushWright</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447694/#Comment_447694" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T10:19:45+00:00" title="August  7, 2015 10:19AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've been thinking this over these last few days, and yeah, you guys are right on the money. I wasn't considering actual play at all, just the aesthetic I'd like to see spat into existence.<br/><br/>So I'm giving my ideal playstyle some consideration, and... I'm not sure, honestly. I'll get back y'all for feedback/suggestions/criticism when my thoughts have formed and somewhat crystallized. <br/><br/>Thanks! This has been really really awesome and enlightening so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447695/#Comment_447695" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T11:17:59+00:00" title="August  7, 2015 11:17AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm dealing into something like this from 7 years now for my narrative framework called Levity.<br/>What you basically need is. aside from narration driven by ownership of something in the fiction (one character, multiple characters, plot or sub-plot ownership, framing, etc..) a way to oppose to narration and a way to decide what is then considered to be true.<br/>Nothing is validated until the complete process is done:<br/>Narration -&gt; Opposition -&gt; Decision<br/>Once a thing is validated is true and cannot be considered false (unless you're playing multiple what-scenarios or players agree to unvalidate consolidated fiction).<br/>Also, in the opposition techniques, you need to consider "coeherence" and "aesthetic" vetos in order to let the players control the fiction.<br/>I'm currently work on IVth edition (in italian), but I've made an english version of the concept draft of the first chapter available here.<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LevityIV-Draft-CAP-I-Eng.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LevityIV-Draft-CAP-I-Eng.pdf</a><br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447736/#Comment_447736" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T21:30:26+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  9:30PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The symbols thing is fascinating, yeah. Are you envisioning this as a standalone, "this by itself could be enough to carry the game" thing?</blockquote>\nWell, more like I was hoping you had some idea on the Dadaist structure to support the gameplay style, so adding symbols was just it to produce a coherent content after play. I was thinking of totally waving away the part about "rewriting the linear plot on each time travel" as by what I've been reading on the thread is doable, but quite complicated. The Primer example being key for that, as for myself, while I got most of the movie, I couldn't made sense of the last few scenes. And yet, it didn't matter to me: the important thing there was how time travel changed the personalities of these men, instead of the minutiae of how they accomplished everything. Like the machine itself, you don't need to understand fully how it works to enjoy the movie, you just need to know that it's a time machine.<br/><br/>But now that you mention it, better explained it could suffice, if that's the sort of gameplay you're actually looking for. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
