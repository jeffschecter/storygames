I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been playing with peccable and MPOSullivan for years, and they introduced me to all of the indie games that I know. Recently I got the chance to flip through Mike\xe2\u20ac\u2122s copy of Reign, and fell hard for the system. Mike started a campaign in our weekly gaming group, and I thought I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d make a play report since I haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seen one for Reign yet. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m playing in this campaign with one eye to running my own campaign in a couple of months, so I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to run it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 1: Character and Setting Creation<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked for an urban setting; another player asked for airships. What somehow emerged was Rook, a multi-tiered city populated by a vast number of different people and cultures; instead of airships the city is visited by fantastically large floating insects of various types. (The large military bugs, known as shadowcasters, are about the size of an airship carrier.) The most prominent outside culture is Vinculum, a mixture of Regency-era England and pre-revolutionary France; Viniculum is very much an imperial power looking to get its hands in everything, but at the same time it stands at the brink of a civil war between the state religion and the aristocracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation was done using the one-roll engine; some players had preexisting ideas and set some of the dice, others\xe2\u20ac\u201dlike me\xe2\u20ac\u201dwent completely random to see what would happen. We ended up with the following four characters:<br/>\n<br/>\nBatala, played by Zoe: a Viniculan lost at a young age and adopted by a band of seafarers known as the Nemef. Viniculum has toyed with the idea of capturing the Nemef as slaves; she would very much like to stop this from happening. Her mission is to rescue her adopted sister; her duty is to protect Jean Baston, who was labeled by prophecy as a potential deliverer; her craving is for the attentions of men; and her problem is fear of heights.<br/>\n<br/>\nJean Baston, played by Camden: an exiled scholar-turned-printer, with revolutionary ambitions and a taste for the pleasures of the flesh. (The model is Benjamin Franklin.) His mission is to establish a republic in Rook; his duty is to the free flow of information; his craving is women. He has a wooden leg and two hated enemies: the other two Baston triplets, Frederick and Maurice, a priest and military officer respectively, who hate each other as much as they hate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam Wyvern, played by me: a retired Viniculan general, charismatic and heroic, whose ambition to bring peace to his homeland is not quite as strong as his need for love. (The model is the Duke of Wellington, if he were a Final Fantasy character.) His mission is to find true love; his duty is to never betray Viniculum; his weakness is an addiction to personal adventure. He is stupidly forgiving, and he made a hated enemy of Maurice Baston by proposing to the future Mrs. Baston in the middle of the bridal procession.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasala, played by Kevin: a former soldier from a conquered province with a storied past,  a multitude of cousins, and a taste for the finer things in footwear. His mission is to free his people; his duty is to honor a life debt owed to Sam Wyvern; his craving is perfectly crafted shoes. His hated enemy is all of Viniculum, and he is Unwholesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up forming a company called the Typesetters, a small group dedicated to the spread of republican ideals, based for the moment on Jean Baston\xe2\u20ac\u2122s personal yacht. The company starts out with a 1 Influence, 0 Might, 0 Treasure, 1 Territory, and 2 Sovereignty.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SuperTarzan" title="SuperTarzan"><img alt="SuperTarzan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SuperTarzan">SuperTarzan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104484/#Comment_104484" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T00:17:19+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 12:17AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2: Getting Started<br/>\n<br/>\nMike decides to open play with the revelation that the Viniculan military has sent one of their shadowcasters, crammed with troops, to the city of Rook, and it is six hours away from docking. The Typesetters, upon discovering this, immediately spring into action: Wyvern and Masala to get some advance money from a potential publishing contract (a local priest with rather racist views named Pendergrass), to help pay for local muscle for a convincing show of force; Baston and Batala to recruit the clansmen of another culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way to Pendergrass, Sam is attacked by a mysterious assassin. Masala runs off to fight the interloper while Sam calls after him, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Right, so, see you for dinner, then?\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nJean and Batala arrive at a small bar to meet the chief of the Noreem clans. The Noreem are basically Mongols who speak with an Irish accent (I think largely because Mike can do a good Irish accent). Batala immediately attracts the attentions of one of the warriors, and they make eyes at each other. Jean\xe2\u20ac\u201dafter a bit of fast talking to placate a gilted ex\xe2\u20ac\u201dhas to make a Graces roll to convince the chief that the arrival of the Viniculans is a threat and they need to make a show of force in response.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasala chases down the assassin (dynamic Run check), and then they square off in the alley. With a couple of convincing headshots, Masala knocks her unconscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam arrives at the church, makes an impossibly high Graces roll, and gets the priest to sign a contract with the Typesetters. He is unable to get advance money, but he has already formed a plan B: he will simply board the ship and tell it to go home.<br/>\n<br/>\nMasala arrives with the body at his cousin Nidal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s house, only to discover that Nidal is having a birthday party for his daughter. Masala asks to use the basement, nods towards the unconscious woman over his shoulder, and says, \xe2\u20ac\u0153It\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll only take a couple of minutes,\xe2\u20ac\x9d without further explanation. This is meant with understandable consternation on Nidal\xe2\u20ac\u2122s part, and finally grudging acceptance. (This scene is the result of Kevin not quite understanding what \xe2\u20ac\u02dcUnwholesome\xe2\u20ac\u2122 meant, and interpreting it to mean that he should act as creepy as possible. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m hesitant to call that a mistake given the scene that it produced, however.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody gathers at the dock to watch the shadowcaster arrive. Sam explains his plan, such as it is, and commandeers a personal transport to dock with the bug carrying the landing party. Masala, perhaps unwillingly, tags along. It quickly becomes clear that the landing party has no intention of docking, at which Sam decides to simply jump from one airship to another. Mike tells me to make an Athletics roll. I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t take the Athletics skill, so I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m rolling just my body stat plus one for Sam\xe2\u20ac\u2122s craving for Adventure, and barely make it. Masala jumps behind me. Kevin explains that if bullets start to fly, Masala\xe2\u20ac\u2122s going to push Sam out of the transport; since that would probably prolong Sam\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life for a few minutes, he would thus fulfill his life debt.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, of course, Sam and Masala are on a hostile vessel with a dozen swords pointed at them. A good Graces roll convinces the first officer to take Sam to see the captain. The captain, however, is Maurice Baston, Sam\xe2\u20ac\u2122s hated enemy. I try an Inspire roll, to see if Sam could undermine his authority among his officers and get the friendlier first officer to take charge of the situation. Mike rolls better, so Maurice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s authority is unquestioned. He mentions to me that the military is searching for the murderer of an aristocrat, currently hidden by the local church; and by the way, this victim is related to the woman we both love. I then try a Knowledge:Strategy roll, to see if Sam can convince Maurice that a diplomatic approach is needed to keep the church from simply smuggling the murderer out of the city. This works phenomenally (I got a 4x9), and Maurice is forced to bow to Sam\xe2\u20ac\u2122s logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ship docks, and Jean manages to arrange a public meeting with his brother at one of the local coffee-houses (known as the Dog\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Bollocks). He asks Batala to help round up local dignitaries for the meeting. Batala balks, saying that she\xe2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be protecting Jean, not acting as a page. \xe2\u20ac\u0153How would this protect you from Maurice?\xe2\u20ac\x9d she asks. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Why,\xe2\u20ac\x9d he replies, \xe2\u20ac\u0153by providing a target-rich environment.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nMike gives each character one final action before company actions start. Jean and Sam are at the Dogs\xe2\u20ac\u2122 Bollocks, rolling Graces to get the town leaders to unite against Maurice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s military imposition. Camden rolls really well (4x10); Maurice ends up stamping out while Jean is eloquently speaking about union and liberty with his peg leg firmly lodged in a bowl of cranberry sauce. Masala wants to plant a bomb on Maurice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s transport and blame the explosion on the church. He also succeeds, so Maurice arrives at the docks late at night to see his ship go up in flames, cursing the name of Frederick (the third Baston triplet). Batala wants to see the Noreem clansman again, but fails her Charm roll; Mike interprets this to mean that although Connell is attracted to her, the date does not go well, and sure enough Connell\xe2\u20ac\u2122s over-bearing sister intervenes and attempts to stifle the budding romance. Batala takes a swing at her, and from there things _really_ don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t go well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe company phase was fairly short, which may simply be a consequence of it happening so late at night. Mike treats the PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s success in acting as a broker between the city of Rook and the dominant military power in the world as a +2d bonus to Influence rolls. I push for a Keeping Informed (Sovereignty+Influence) roll at first, to discover the location of the murderer (which could be used as leverage in further dealings with the Viniculans). This fails, and we discover nothing. However, I get the idea to make a Train and Levy Troops (Sovereignty+Territory) roll, which succeeds, and the Company successfully establishes a small militia under Sam\xe2\u20ac\u2122s personal command known as the Republican Lancers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SuperTarzan" title="SuperTarzan"><img alt="SuperTarzan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SuperTarzan">SuperTarzan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104485/#Comment_104485" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T00:19:04+00:00" title="October 24, 2007 12:19AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as you can probably tell, the one-roll character creation system is excellent for getting a group of characters with rich backstories, especially if you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t mind things going over the top. I tend to play manipulators, schemers, and generally amoral people, so Sam Wyvern (who is pretty much a heroic character who acts without ulterior motives or any sense of self-preservation) is a major change of pace for me. I felt like character creation gave me a strong enough sense of Sam that I could find his voice very easily even though it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s not quite what I was used to. It was also appealing enough that I found myself wanting to protect the character (by not saying the snarky things that come to mind).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system also really good for character interrelationships, if you start out with the proviso that the characters _are_ interconnected before the start of play. Since people are creating their backstory at the table and not coming up with something beforehand, things are really in flux\xe2\u20ac\u201dCamden could say to me, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Maybe I was at the wedding where you caused a scene,\xe2\u20ac\x9d and I could come back with, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Hey, maybe it was your brother who was getting married that day,\xe2\u20ac\x9d and things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\xe2\u20ac\u2122d never done anything with the ORE before, but I found the system to be quick and intuitive. The system also allows for a variety of tactics in both social and physical conflicts, which I really liked. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m used to social conflicts being governed by a single skill (\xe2\u20ac\u0153Sway\xe2\u20ac\x9d, f\xe2\u20ac\u2122r example); and I really like being able to switch to a different tack like you might in an actual conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody was particularly happy with the XP system, so we ended up modifying it: one XP for attending the session, one for each problem that you hit during a session, and one for an accomplishment as voted by the group. An accomplishment could either be a cool line, a really good roll, or a clever tactical move, so long as the group was impressed with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the Company mechanics, and how PC action influences Company rolls; but I feel like it has an inherent tendency to feel a little abstract. I think narration is particularly important here; you can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t just say, \xe2\u20ac\u0153I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m making a Keeping Informed roll. Oh, I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get a match.\xe2\u20ac\x9d It should sound more like, \xe2\u20ac\u0153I go to my usual informants looking for tidbits about where that killer is squirreled away; however, word of my particular interest must have gotten around, because when I arrived home the next day there was, scrawled in blood, the words BURN IN THE SEVENTH HELL, HERETIC.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m getting the impression that later sessions of the game are going to have to be more player-driven and planned out with the eventual Company action in mind, especially if you want to get through a month of gameplay every session. \xe2\u20ac\u0153I think the Typesetters should kidnap this murderer from the church. Well, to do _that_ my character is going to round together a band of cutthroats to boost our Might, and your character can broadcast the sexual peccadillos of prominent priests to sabotage their Influence, etc., etc.\xe2\u20ac\x9d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104651/#Comment_104651" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T15:19:05+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  3:19PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2007 3:21PM by DanielSolis.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SuperTarzan</cite>Also, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m getting the impression that later sessions of the game are going to have to be more player-driven and planned out with the eventual Company action in mind, especially if you want to get through a month of gameplay every session.</blockquote>\nDo you suppose there is an opportunity there for Greg to develop a sort of a one-roll "continuing campaign" generator?<br/><br/>Incidentally, I really dig the setting you developed.
