                    Sydney just typed what I've been on about for a while now: character generation and how it sows disappointment in the fertile fields of imagination.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize:<br/>
<br/>
You need characters if you're going to tell a story. Let's assume you're responsible for one, who's going to be a protagonist, though maybe we'd share them, or maybe something else. Doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
That character is defined through actions they take.<br/>
<br/>
That character's player has resources to use to give that player authority over certain areas of narration.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, those resources have been defined by this challenge: <i>make decisions now that will benefit you later.</i> That's because it's how wargames work, and that's because it's a particular (fairly accurate) view of how war works: you strategically determine what resources you need, then you suffer through the mistakes, use your advantages, and use them both flexibly in the face of changing situations.<br/>
<br/>
But there's no reason to think that way when you've got a character in a story. It's not how it works in a story. You have a character enter a scene. Maybe there's some description, maybe there's foreshadowing. But we don't know she speaks Farsi until it comes up andwe don't know she's hiding a pistol. Ironically, what we might be able to tell, given genre clues, is that she's going to have some sort of romantic tryst with her rival/sidekick and that she's going to retrieve the artifact at the end of the story.<br/>
<br/>
Absinthe and Shock: already work like this to different degrees. I don't see any reason not to, given a Narrativist agenda.<br/>
<br/>
You?                </div>

                            Sure.<br>
<br>
Why not?  In fact, you could do this with just about any game.<br>
<br>
Dogs does it with NPC's, and with PC relationships, why not with traits too?<br>
<br>
One potential drawback:<br>
<br>
It takes some power over the character away from the character's primary owner, and gives it to the scene framer.  It allows the scene framer to put pressure on the character owner, by saying, "Make your character good at the stuff in this scene."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            The more I think about "generating characters" the weirder it seems.  <br><br>I'm very happy with the Roach, where you think up a name and check off four boxes.  That seems about right in terms of pre-game commitment, because it gives you a toe-hold and something to work with.                        </br></br></div>

                            I agree that games with a narrativist agenda don't need to create characters in the same way a gamist agenda would. Heroquest's option to fill in the character as the game progresses is another example and quite a blast.<br><br>I'd venture that the more tightly a game sets up its situation, the less character creation you need (like the Roach perhaps). While looser games like Sorcerer or Heroquest need more in order to help everyone get an idea of what the story will actually be about.                        </br></br></div>

                            Writting a paragraph of nice color is enough to get a consistent character. In <i>The Pool</i>, traits could be selected during play with no trouble. I also like that in <i>Breaking the Ice</i> you may add any trait to a character during play as needed.<br/><br/>I'm wondering about how much stuff do you need to write or select (invest?) to have a consistent and grabbing idea for a character.<br/><br/>And I'm also thinking how much of the character generation is there to substitute a stage for shared creation of situation. The <i>Universalis</i> tenets stage prepare the play with no need of character creation. Everything about characters is created or eliminated during play as it is revealed.                        </div>

                            ffilz, no, it doesn't HAVE to be that way, but in order for it to NOT be that way, the character owner has to stand up and claim that right from the scene framer, which isn't a common occurrence, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to explicitly prevent this power shift (which you may or may not want) then there needs to be a way for the character owner to veto a scene.                        </div>

                            Fred - true. Universalis of course does have a way to veto a scene. If the conflict presented to you in Dogs is completely uninteresting, you can reject the scene (by giving immediately if the GM forces the scene on you - note that if you're not willing to give immediately, then the conflict IS interesting).<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about Dogs and chargen, what IS important if one will have a GM who has to prep something is that there needs to be a mechanism for the players to communicate their interests to the GM.<br/>
<br/>
But even without a GM preping outside of play (if there even is a GM), all participants in a game need to communicate up front what they want out of the game. Character generation is just one way of opening this communication.<br/>

<p><em>"I don't see any reason not to, given a Narrativist agenda."</em></p>
<p>With that as a given, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But, really, I often wants me some game in my story, some emulation in my game, and so on.  So, I suspect that while minimalist generation may well be worth exploring, the idea of abolishing it doesn't strike me as fun.</p>
<p>That's me, though, and now that it's been said, I'll get out of the way, and wish you luck on your exploration.</p>

                            For some time, I've pondered running Storyteller (particularly Adventure!) or some such in such a way that only core details about a character are defined up front (The PI has high Investigation, the Female Aviator has high Piloting, etc.) and that points can be spent _in play_, _at the time of conflict_ to improve skills that the player thinks should be better.<br/>

                            Blue - i've been trying to codify a system for doing basically the same thing with GURPS...<br/>
<br/>
It just seems like great fun to start with a character who has "leads", either across the field or just a core principle, but who can be developed more fully in play - is encouraged &amp; rewarded to be developed in play.<br/>

Ideally you can keep your crunchy bits &amp; juggle them too...                        </div>

                            How about generating characters before the story starts (to some degree), but taking their skills, abilities, whatever as  for what kind of story is to come? (Which, of course, a good traditional GM does anyway). So instead of trying to determine the point value of an ability (or of one "level" of an ability) based on how useful it is, in some unfathomable objective abstract, you give it a point value based on how often you want to see it come up.<br/>
<br/>
A: "Okay, I want my character to be a master super ninja of death. Like, +10."<br/>
B: "But this is a romantic comedy game."<br/>
A: "Yeah, it's just background. Like, it might come up once every few sessions."<br/>
B: "Fine. One point per level, +10, that's ten points. What about the rest?"<br/>
A: "Cooking +5, and I want it to come up all the freakin' time. 10 points a level."<br/>
B: "Cooking in every scene, check."<br/>
<br/>
But even this method has the weakness that maybe you don't really know, beforehand, what you want to see in the game. So you should at least have a bunch of unspent points going into the first scene.<br/>
<br/>
Creating characters  on the fly, conversely, is tricky. Tony Lower-Basch tried this in an early version of "Capes," as an experiment, pretty much at my insistence, and it created very scattered, unfocused characters -- but then a Capes character is defined by a list of 12 things. My draft "apocalypse girl" tries to get around this by giving each player a "core" and allowing characters to be defined by one or two attributes.                        </div>

Baron Munchausen, Soap, Pantheon, and Once Upon a Time are all good examples.  However, I think you're promoting a misconception here.  The Narrativist agenda is not defined as "doing it the way that books/movies do it".  So, just because writers don't roll dice for their plots doesn't mean that dice-rolling is inappropriate for the Narrativist agenda.  Similarly, just because novelists don't have character sheets doesn't mean that a character sheet is inappropriate for a Narrativist agenda.  <br/><br/>In stories, approaches vary.  Character abilities and weaknesses are often  established by description before they are used in foreground conflicts.  It's fairly normal for there to be a bunch of establishing scenes that let the audience know about the main character, prior to any major conflict.  On the other hand, there are times when things are pulled out of the blue.                        </div>

                            The main contention that I have with removing character generation or minimizing it in such a way is that:<br/><br/>1) It can thwart the players from being invested in the story.  In traditional RPGs, the character is (mostly) your own invention.  It's your investment in the game.  When the players have other powers, such as scene-framing, it certainly gives them other opportunities for investment in the game - but it's also very nebulous - kinda like having a 20% share in 'liberty'.  You know you're invested on an intellectual scale, but there's no proof of it sitting in front of you - nothing concrete to say 'this is my stake, come hell or high water'.  <br/><br/>Certainly not all groups and not all RPGs need this sort of investment, but I think getting rid of it completely is a minus, not a plus.<br/><br/>2) Imagination works best within limits, in my experience.  Ask someone to 'create a character - any character you want', and you risk mental vapor-lock.  I see character generation as a way of focusing player's imaginations to the tasks at hand, to put them into a certain frame of mind for communicating with each other.  Not to mention that character creation, even if it has some limitations on it, also requires that players think about their characters in way that they might not at first - if the game has an 'empathy' trait, the player has to ask themselves: "How empathetic <i>is</i> Torgo the Innkeeper?"  And the answer might surprise themselves.<br/><br/>In short - I see character generation as a tool, not an obstacle, to the creative process.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As to this focusing players on making decisions that benefit them - again, I don't see this as a bug, but a feature.  Especially if these decisions are in conflict with one another.  Certainly, players are going to play to the protect their stake, their investment, in the SIS.  Protecting these investments generates conflict, which is key.  In some narrativist games, it seems like you have to go the extra mile to generate conflicts - everything's all about consensus.  I think that a little extra friction in the consensus process is a good thing.                        </div>

                            With <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Verge</a>, what I'm trying to do (and this isn't well covered in the manuscript yet) is have the group collectively define the Color of the Setting and create a Situation (I call all this stuff Story) before making characters. I imagine the group drawing a sort of r-map with corporations and technologies and ideas and people on it and connecting them with lines that represent events and relationships. They do this until the GM says it's "cooked," then they play. <br/><br/>Any time during the Story Creation phase, a player can claim one of the people on the r-map as his character. He can change his mind at any time, abandon that character, and pick a different person who isn't already claimed. When Story Creation is done, then the players flesh out the characters. The character generation rules will require players to choose a Drive and various Drive-related Problems, some of which must relate back to stuff on the r-map. They'll have some freedom to add stuff to the r-map on the spot during c-gen. They will also pick their traits, which are Edges and Issues (nee Strengths and Weaknesses), Allies and Enemies, and Gear, some of which must be tied back to the r-map again. They'll be allowed to add stuff to the r-map now, too.<br/><br/>So basically I have them creating Setting and Situation first, and those absolutely drive Character.                        </div>

                            There's a lot of games, like the ones that John names, which are basically already doing this.  There's also a lot of games (Polaris, Capes, Dogs to some extent, The Mountain Witch) where you aren't starting with a concrete character so much as a little bit of the fuel that you're going to burn and refresh during play.<br/>

                            John and Levi, you guys are imagining that I have some way to abolish a technique. That's nonsense. I design games. Those are the only rules I have control over.<br/>
<br/>
Fred, you said, "It takes some power over the character away from the character's primary owner, and gives it to the scene framer. It allows the scene framer to put pressure on the character owner, by saying, "Make your character good at the stuff in this scene.""<br/>
<br/>
... but the pregen character concept means that you have the pressure to use stuff that's irrelevant. Much worse.<br/>
<br/>
Xenopulse (Christian, right?) is right, of course: a separation of player and character power is what's required to make this work.<br/>
<br/>
The games John mentions are great for this, it's true. The theory is applied <br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question moves over a step: why this trend? Is it that it's so clear that we don't need to invest nonfun to get fun?                        </div>

                            I'm saying that character building in solitary, just like campaign generation (complete with skills/traps that never get activated, character story hooks that don't become relevant, NPCs who don't get met, and all that stuff) is nonfun.<br/>
<br/>
That is, <i>making characters</i> is fun. There's no reason to turn it into homework. It's become a stated goal of many designs to eliminate the homework factor of campaign design. I think I'm seeing that happen in character design too. It's just dawned on me more slowly than it has to others.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I'm restricting this concept to Narrativist design is because there are perfectly valid Gamist reasons not to do this: character creation can be a area of strategic play (which is how it is in old games), for instance. But for Narrativist concerns, I think it's showing to be a more fun way of making a character that works as a protagonist.                        </div>

                            Yeah, homework: something you do that's of little benefit to you now, but is supposedly to your benefit later. Particularly since most of what you put on a character sheet won't get used. The object  of character creation in GURPS, Cyberpunk and D&amp;D is to have the fewest things on your sheet that you won't use.                        </div>

<blockquote>Yeah, homework: something you do that's of little benefit to you now, but is supposedly to your benefit later. Particularly since most of what you put on a character sheet won't get used.

I think a lot of that comes from "game balance" concerns, so that players don't suddenly have their characters becoming 10th degree blackbelts at the drop of a hat.  I certainly have no problem with people leaving skill points or even feats left blank on their character sheet and their points/slots held in reserve for the future, even in a <i>D&amp;D</i> game.  <br><br>But then I've been accused of being a "player suckup"-style-GM.  However, I do think that character concept is important, and that limitations and boundaries in the creation process help shape a better character, not a worse one.  There's certainly room for nebulousity in pregen characters.                        </br></br></div>

That's weird. Because that's exactly when I'd want to discover that my guy's a 10th degree black belt.<br><br>Consider this:<br/><br/>Chargen in a particular game is roleplayed. You have x Character Points to spend as you will and everyone knows that you have to wind up, and the end of this little adventure, at the point where the rest of the story starts. During character creation, you gain CPs as normal. Then the rest of the story starts. Sometimes you have extra CPs left over that you can spend at will.<br/><br/>That sounds like fun, right? You get an introductory adventure that feeds into the larger adventure, during which you get exactly the stuff that will be most useful in this game, and you do it by playing the game.<br/><br/>Now, assuming that this system works so far, where does character generation end? All those numbers on your sheet have a story behind them. Wouldn't it be fun to learn that story?                        </br></br></div>

<p>This has a lot more impact in a D&amp;D game, where such abilities interact with another in a complexly crunchy manner, and a major part of gameplay is constructing effective ability synergies, than it does in for instance HQ, where all abilities are more or less identical.</p>

                            Why is this a dichotomy?<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that you either create characters during the narrative phase of the game, cooperatively with the other participants, or else do it sequestered in your lonely writer's garrett?<br/>
<br/>
Come on, noone here makes characters that way.<br/>
<br/>
The compromise case is perfectly reasonable.  During the character generation phase, players bounce ideas off each other, reformulate, and shift their flags.<br/>
<br/>
I started a game of "Heaven and Earth" on sunday night in IRC.  Melvin Spellbound started out as a nebbishly ice cream man with good social interaction stats.  When everyone else seemed to be going in that direction I totally redid him, and Mel Spellbound became the new county sherriff.  When the GM said that actually, he had an NPC sherriff for the game, I stepped back and made him a deputy.<br/>
<br/>
I can't be unique in doing this.  Making characters isn't "homework," it's a shared activity where the participants negotiate for narrative space.  The only reason we don't see it as "play" is because it has always been thought of as "prep" ... but it's not.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at my most recent offering for an example of how character creation can integrate into the entire game process:<br/>
<br/>
http://vaxalon.livejournal.com/2006/02/17/<br/>
<br/>
The short version: This proto-game takes the ENTIRE process of play, from deciding what the game will be about, to deciding what the setting will be like, to who the protagonists will be, to actually narrating scenes, and makes it part of one continuum of play with similar mechanics all the way through.  It's not complete yet, and it will probably never be "done" but I think it has some useful points to make in this discussion.                        </div>

<i>I'm saying that character building in solitary, just like campaign generation (complete with skills/traps that never get activated, character story hooks that don't become relevant, NPCs who don't get met, and all that stuff) is nonfun.</i><br/><br/>Although I can see the utility of discarding character generation in its current paradigm I have some issues with this statement. In any game I have run since I was eighteen or so character generation was never a solitary process. Characters were always generated together by the players together with the GM to accomplish story goals. Any game where characters are generated in a vacuum is characteristically a failure in my mind. <br/><br/>That being said one of the core ideas of Heisenberg was that characters are delineated by their motivations as much as anything else.                        </div>

                            Never mind if it's a solitary activity because of where you're sitting. That's not what I'm talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you do with your character in a game, once you create a character, is influenced by the other people at the table. For instance, the GM's setting up opposition, and there are rules about the Experience your character gets, based supposedly on events that happen in the course of the game. It's deeply collaborative because it can't happen without actual game stuff happening.<br/>
<br/>
Chargen, though: you can listen to everyone around you if you want, but the stuff you're putting down on your sheet is only what you think will be useful. It's not based on actually playing any game other than a speculative one.                        </div>

                            Joshua -- it seems to me that you have a very limited view of what character generation is.  You're suggesting that it is blind speculation about what will happen in the future, but there are a lot of other possibilities: <br/><br/>1) Character generation can be creating flags which <i>suggest</i> to other participants what you want to have happen in future game sessions.  i.e. Rather than speculating, you're making suggestions.  For example, you can define Relationships in Dogs in the Vineyard, or even more strongly put down characters in your cosmos in Polaris.  The adventures are then generated based on what's on your character sheet.  <br/><br/>2) Character generation can give you power to <i>define</i> what will happen in future game sessions.  For example, when I take a Hunted (11-) in Champions, I am defining a villain who will show up in the campaign 62.4% of the time.  <br/><br/>3) Character generation needn't be about chosen design at all -- stuff can happen in it, such as lifepath generation like Traveller or other random creation.<br/><br/>4) Character creation can also involve group interaction: like in Orkworld where the players collectively create a household, or Ars Magica where you create a covenant together.                        </div>

I get what you're saying - that if you play out chargen instead of just sitting around doing it in a vacuum - you're going to get a more integrated character.  But the character you generate is still going to be optimized towards the player's expectations of what the continued campaign will be like and other factors, like personal preference - you're still going to play a cleric if you want to play a cleric.<br/><br/>In other words, while the integrated chargen may make for a more integrated character in terms of the setting or narrative, I doubt that it will completely eliminate player's tendencies to invest a character with attributes that they think will be more effective in the long run - to optimize it, basically.                        </div>

By 'effective' I mean more likely to get used, to be of use to the character and the campaign.  No point in taking 5 points of Riding skill when you're never going to have a scene on a horse.                        </div>

Your example works equally well with Dogs in the Vineyard ("Can paddle a canoe up a waterfall 2d8") or My Life With Master ("Can pilot any vessel perfectly, except when sober").  I'm suspicious that you're casting this as a GURPS situation to project bad associations on it.  <br/><br/>More to the point, the example also works if we use your suggested system where traits end up on the character sheet based on conflicts.  So imagine we're playing your suggested system.  The game begins with the characters in space and there is one piloting check to scout the system.  Based on that conflict, you add "Ship's Pilot" to your character sheet.  But then the ship's busted and you spend the rest of the game not using the Pilot trait.  <br/><br/>What this comes down to is that regardless of how they get there, unless the players have some control over the larger situations they are in (like Theatrix improvisations or Buffy Plot Twists), then any in-character abilities can in principle be neutralized.                        </div>

What happens when there's nothing left over to attribute to piloting at the end of the pre-adventure?  Or is the player simply going to hold onto those points for later when they can be put towards the character's stated concept?  I mean - you're still ostensibly the pilot - at some point you're going to want to have a piloting skill, and hopefully one that's slightly better than average, or at least better than everyone else.<br/><br/>The only real procedure I can see working is for the characters to be <i>tabula rasa</i> at the beginning of the game, with no real concept on behalf of the player.  Which is a really hard situation for some players to get into - there's no handles for play.<br/><br/>Really I see this as a failure on the part of the GM (since we're talking GURPS) ... you're not giving each character spotlight time.                        </div>

But in the meantime, you can spend all of those points on becoming, say, a great lover, fighter and card-player.  So by the end of the process, you've got a character (or rather, all of them) as jack-of-all-trades instead of focused ones with defined roles, which I find more effective and satisfying - but then I'm a Jungian.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<em>Character creation, in any game with experience, is an ongoing process.</em><br/><br/>Word.  It's not a character until you've played it for a half hour or so.  Which means, yes, that spending points buying atts and skills is not creating a character -- it's creating the blueprint of a character that will only be realized in actual roleplay.<br/><br/>Character is always defined by roleplay.  Always.  No, really -- always.  The stuff on your "character sheet" is a listing of player resources (and maybe flags) which may or may not bear a strong relation to the character that you end up playing.                        </div>

                            Amen to the Joshuas.<br/>
<br/>
And now, to pick shrapnel from my own polemical fragmentation grenade out of my hide, let me step back from what I said before ( "CHARGEN" IS THE ENEMY OF STORY" --http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=159) and try to explain better what I'm trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
To quote myself: "What worries me is that the more cool detail there is in the published setting -- or in my character, for that matter -- BEFORE play starts, the less room my friends and I have to invent cool details that are even better, because they're OURS." (http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=175&amp;page=1#Item_20)<br/>
<br/>
OURS, as opposed to "the published author's" for setting, and as opposed to "mine alone" for chargen. What's more, "ours" in a dynamic sense of something that arises from an ongoing interaction, as opposed to thinking it out beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, there needs to be some "thinking it out beforehand" to avoid total confusion and lack of focus. Heck, I give this advice to every person to posts on the Forge that "hey, we played Capes, and it was kinda random": "Dude, just because you can start playing this game without having any idea of what you want to do doesn't mean you SHOULD."<br/>
<br/>
This thinking-beforehand can be hardwired by the written system ("you're heroic adventures who go into caves to kill monsters and take their stuff, go!") or brainstormed by the particular group (as in PTA pitches) or any combination thereof. But it does need doing.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm arguing for, really, is a much lower ratio of "thinking it out beforehand" to "developing it through play" than is traditional in the hobby. (World of Darkness setting, and GURPS point-build characters, much as I love 'em, are the prime villains in this regard, and very different from Dogs et al). I'm not really calling for the abolition of "chargen," or of setting. I'm not even necessarily suggesting that character generation and setting need to be short and sweet (though that often helps).<br/>
<br/>
What  I AM suggesting is that character creation, setting, and every other sort of preparation should be conceived as sparks to light the fire of actual play, rather than as sources of heat and light in and of themselves.                        </div>

And to revise &amp; extend my remarks above:<br/>
<br/>
Note that I am not merely saying "too much crappy setting/chargen/prep gets in the way." I am saying "too much GOOD setting/chargen/prep gets in the way, precisely because it's so good you have trouble letting go of it and being open to the far cooler thing you will produce in play."<br/>
<br/>
"Cooler" here NOT being about publication-ready material, or even an objective standard of artistic merit, but simply what is exciting, engaging, and insightful for YOU, because you made it yourself with your friends. Maybe everyone else thinks it's crap; that's not the point. "Hearing about your game should suck."                        </div>

                            Well, I've never done any historical or real-world-present games "straight" with no fantastical or imaginary elements, and I think it's fairly rare in the hobby overall, so that might be answer right there -- but more profoundly:<br/>
<br/>
The attitude you take towards your material (setting, character sheet, other prep) is more important than the sheer amount of material -- although an imposing, impressive mass of material makes it harder to have the right attitude. If you take even a tiny, slender bit of material and say "this is canon, everything we do must conform to this," you're in trouble. If you can take a huge book of raw material (fictional, real history, doesn't matter) and say, "this is the starting point, this is inspiration, this is the spark for the fire we build together" -- you're golden.<br/>
<br/>
I see no functional difference between<br/>
<br/>
A: My sire is the secret Vampire Prince of Detroit!<br/>
B: No, the book says it's this guy, he's the wrong bloodline, can't do it.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
A: My dad is a deputy battalion commander in the 101st Airborne Division as they land behind enemy lines on D-Day!<br/>
B: No, the book says it was this guy, he didn't have any kids as of D-Day, can't do it.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that "A" and "B" can be two people or two voices in the same person's head.                        </div>

                            But some folks find working with an existing canon, real or imaginary, to be a useful aid in building the foreground. The frequent comparison is to any rigidly structured poetic form, like the sonnet - rather than invent a form, you figure out how to say what you want to say within its confines. The exercise of fitting idea to the constraints of "history" for the setting at hand can be fun as well as productive for some folks. I don't mind anyone feeling otherwise, but knowing that people do actually like doing it might be a help in advocating for alternatives. Not nearly as many people are <i>suffering</i> under the weight of canon as canon-disbelievers sometimes imagine, or so I've found over the years.<br/><br/>(The White Wolf case is the one I know best, partly because I did a survey of customers' preferences when the Camarilla was getting overhauled. More than a thousand responses, many with comments well beyond the check boxes and ratings and all, so I feel I actually have a sense of that audience. Others, in fuzzier ways.)<br/><br/>The responses from someone interested in maintaining the canon would include things like "unacknowledged bastard" (interestingly common with high-ranking military officers and their wills, but that's another story), child of someone influential but not at the top, playing an already established real historical person (I've only done that once, with a game set in 1810s St. Louis, and every PC was someone documentable; it was cool and I've been meaning to do it again), character with mistaken view of ancestry, and like that. Or, for that matter, just going ahead and making the adjustment for hte sake of the story, something that companies with detail-rich settings routinely write about as an option and nobody ever pays attention. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(The valid objection is that a thing that looks like an encyclopedia seldom invites adjustment on the fly for a particular chronicle. I agree with this. But then that spins off another thread, about how to give unobvious advice, which I've been wanting to get some thoughts about anyway.)                        </div>

                            I don't think there are many games that couldn't be done this way.  Even something as mechanically complex as DnD 3.0/3.5 could do it; skill choices, spells in the spell book, ranger preferred foes, all that stuff could be done on the fly.<br/>

The question is not how, but why.  What does it gain, and what does it lose?                        </div>

                            To me the issue is that a table top RPG is a complex arrangement of art and desire where multiple players are building a work of fiction in real-time. It is for precisely this reason, in my opinion, that the old-style character generation was created (consciously or not). With a set of numbers that provide guidelines for roleplay, those less comfortable with acting or writing (aka, building a character on the fly) have a series of benchmarks to follow that tell them how to roleplay. The old style character creation helps transform a lack of imagination or social discomfort into roleplaying. I suppose one might consider it Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsocial lubeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœRPG lubeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. :)<br/>
<br/>
I think a gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s market should determine the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character creation method. A game targeted to people fully invested in the idea of real-time fiction should probably have a much more organic and story-like approach to character building. Games designed for younger players or games built for the Ã¢â‚¬ËœtwitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ crowd should probably concentrate on teaching the player how attributes = cues for roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
The character-creation-as-you-go-so-that-it-doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t-blow-immersion thing is a problem for many game genres. Computer Ã¢â‚¬ËœRPGsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and MMOs go to great lengths to teach players how to use the controls and build their characters without killing immersion. I think they mostly fail because they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really understand what immersion is all about (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a subject for another conversation).  Morrowind III is a good example of a game that more completely understands immersion and storytelling. Their character creation is all about your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history and background and star signs, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Although this is a separate thought, it is a related one: I feel like it is this area Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the immersion, real-time fiction, shared imagination space thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this aspect of table top games thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to keep them around for a long time. It will be our childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children who make the computer games that can compete with four people sitting around the table telling stories about their characters. <br/>

If character creation is not what you sat down to do, preferring to, you know, play the game of making a story with your friends, it's probably better to do on-the-fly creation (with system support; I can see this really sucking unfunly in certain situations Ã¢â‚¬â€ lots of breaks in the action to look stuff up, for instance).<br/>
<br/>
If you want the strategic arena of the game to be character creation, or if you want character creation to tell you how to play, then you want it up front.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that a lot of on-the-fly chargen is gonna be designed into games in the next couple of years or so. It's started already and it's just gonna get better as systems are created to optimize it.                        </div>

The Accomplishment as the last phase of character creation that gives you a little mini-conflict to run through -- it is all at once a good tutorial, a potent bit of character investment, and a beautiful transition from character generation to roleplay.                        </div>

                            If you want to get really bleeding-edge crazy, have all the players make one of these proto-characters each and throw them into a scene.  At the end of the scene, players can elect to keep that proto-character or cash it in for a new one (perhaps with one extra die for their trouble or whatever).  The discarded characters become supporting charactes / non-player characters.                        </div>

                            I think early play will naturally be slowed down a little if the characters are not very well defined conceptually.  So you might want to have somewhat distinct early character-defining play from usual play.  Perhaps have a pool of free points to add in like free relationship dice.  Once they're used up then the rate of adds/change to the character slows down.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I'd quibble a little with the designation of "not play" for character creation.  Character creation is a separate phase of play with its own rules, like placing of initial settlements in Settlers of Catan.  The traditional solution is to make character creation fun -- what Robin Laws calls "fantasy shopping for guys".                        </div>

                            Well, yeah.  He does at least comment and discuss the gender issue there, which I give him props for.  (This is from Robin's Laws of Good Gamemastering.)  That is, he suggests that the super-power buying aspect of most RPGs is really tailored for characteristically male fantasies.  So ostensibly it's descriptive of games rather than prescriptive.  <br/>
<br/>
However, he doesn't cite a less gendered approach, though that's probably better than the common answers of how to make games appeal to girls (i.e. "Put in more clothes and fashion" and crap).                        </div>

                            One thing I'm always reminded of, is the fact that a lot of fiction, that is stories, television, and books, spend a GODAWFUL amount of time "getting us to know the character" either by expository narration, or dialogue, or what have you. They go out of their way to flash back and show scenes that tell us about said person.<br>
<br>
Now sure, these things often begin with less, but that's relatively recent, pulp stories (and those that write homages and in that style) even begin with a full on description of their lead that could almost have numbers added and be made a character sheet.<br>
<br>
Now I don't think its intrinsically bad to have character generation, BECAUSE UNLIKE those fictions, you have a group of people, who're not sharing the same brain, who need to get on the same page. Character creation is very much like television series bible creation "this is true" and "this is not true' for our series.<br>
<br>
With a single writer and vision its less important--with multiple writers it becomes more important that you create said bible, so you don't create unbelievable, unaccepablte situations.<br>
<br>
Now personally I like getting into play as fast as possible, so a PC generation system where game-speak is minimal, or nonexistant, for example using a flashback to explain a trait or examplify a situation, perhaps as openning narrations/credits montage might be interesting to see. (Ala old Impossible Mission, or A-Team,  Buffy)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But one must remember, while games like these share traits with stories, novels, tv shows, they are a different thing, with some of its own limitations and needs.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Or:  Pick either a first name or a last name, take three tokens, describe the situation the person is in.<br/>
<br/>
Every time there is a conflict, either a) spend tokens to get a new trait at a value equal to tokens, or b) get a token.  (Essentially the same as Joshua's suggestion, except it is front-loaded and lets the player make more flexible choices about when and how traits are added.) <br/>
<br/>
I'm also thinking that to do this, the important thing is to description of the character.  Make the game consciously movie-like: here's a person doing something.  We only have outward clues about what the person is like, or what their agenda might be.  Everything else gets made during play.                        </div>

                            The only 'problem' with something so freeform, Piers, is that I suspect it will result in rather unfocused character creation.  There's giving the players freedom,l and then there's pushing the players out of the airplane.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of Dogs is that character advancement/development is intrinsically the fallout of character conflicts, and in the world of Dogs, characters develop through adversity.  That gives players some pretty solid guidelines that still offer a lot of different contextual options.<br/><br/>Defining traits <em>in the middle of</em> conflicts will have a much more convenient and less hard-earned feel to them than defining traits <em>as a result of</em> conflict.<br/><br/>However, that said -- if that's the game you're going for, go for it.  The proposition that "characters are only developed through adversity" is not a universal truth, it's just how some games and stories work.                        </div>

                            Snowball's variation is such that Traits are defined as they show up in the story.  Your character could be an expert sharpshooter, but until it's necessary for the story, it's not on the sheet.  Once it's necessary for the story, you pay for it, and it shows up in the story.<br/>
<br/>
So by committing to a new Trait for your character (or increasing an existing trait), you commit to using it in the next scene (and thus indirectly provide impetus for the next scene, saying 'this will come into play, so the scene should be framed appropriately').                        </div>

This reminds me very much of my experiences with EPICS:<br/>
<br/>
http://edge.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=1807&amp;<br/>
<br/>
In EPICS, your character sheet has very little on it at the start of the game, you can put stuff on it, but you're not required to.  But you have a pool of points.<br/>
<br/>
When your character faces a situation, you spend that pool of points to add things to your character sheet. Such as:<br/>
<br/>
"'Well, naturally I know how to fly a plane, you bounder!' I say, tapping my pipe in the ashtray. 'All members of the Explorer's Club do...'." costs a little bit. <br/>
<br/>
"'Thank God I read a book one time on how to fly a plane! Quick, give me the controls!...um...these look different!'" costs more due to urgency.<br/>
<br/>
"'Ha! Safely land a plane with both engines out and the landing gear gone? Done it a thousand times! Why not blindfold me and make it interesting?'" costs a lot due to urgency AND the overwhelming skill of the character.<br/>
<br/>
You can also get points back into this pool by contributing to the game world or causing problems for your character:<br/>
<br/>
"'Are you crazy?? I don't know how to fly a plane! We're all gonna die!!'" gains you points because you are establishing a limitation of your character, for example. If the "Explorer's Club" hadn't been invented before you mentioned it above, you might gain back a few points for introducing it.<br/>
<br/>
There's a more standard "reward for roleplaying" section that relates to writing personality traits of your characters.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely worth a look if you are interested in design-in-play sorts of approaches to characters.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when I proposed this game to my group, they loudly protested. "How can I decide what my character would do if I don't know what he CAN do?" <br/>
<br/>
I say, "Well, you can just decide by what would be cool to you, the player..." That was not suitable, what they thought was cool to them, the players, was knowing what the character could do. Interestingly, A) this was even true of the players who hate character creation and consider it a blight, and B) nobody really plays immersively in our group.                        </div>
