Something like "If I win...", then their opponent declares their goal, "If I win...".<br/><br/>DRAW<br/>Each participant draws five cards from a standard poker deck, with Jokers in. If the GM has multiple characters in a scene, each one gets to draw 5 cards. (Not sure how this will work out in big scenes. Maybe a bigger pool of cards based on the number of PCs in a scene?)<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The initiating player declares an action and plays one card.<br/><br/>The opposing player declares a reaction and plays one card. For the reaction to take effect the card played must be of equal or greater value.<br/><br/>For example: A goon's robbing a bank. Batman's watching from the rafters. The goon declares "I shoot the teller" and plays a 6 of clubs. Batman declares "I throw a Batarang to disarm the goon" and plays a 9 of hearts. Batman's card is higher so his action becomes true in the fiction.<br/><br/>Play goes back and forth like this with one-upping declarations and cards till either side can't or won't continue. Can't because they've run out of cards or won't because they decide to give in.<br/><br/>Any player can reset the stack by playing two cards with their declaration. The lower of which is used for the new "high" card. So if your opponent plays a card you can't beat, you can play two lower cards and go back to a lower number to beat. For example: Batman plays a king of diamonds. The goon plays a 3 of spades and a 7 of hearts. The 3 of spades is now the stack's high card to beat.<br/><br/>DRAW MORE CARDS<br/>Players can opt to stress an Aspect to draw 2 more cards during a scene. Only one Aspect can be stressed during a scene. This bit is a little wobbly. I'm going with the assumption that Aspects are similar to Fate Aspects, but that each can take stress, likely a simple 3-4 box stress track for each. And maybe 5-6 Aspect for a character.<br/><br/>MULTIPLE CHARACTERS<br/>Every player with a character that has something at stake in the conflict must have a stated goal and must play a card every round. Play starts with the initiating player and goes around the table till everyone who wants to continue in the scene plays a card. Anyone who doesn't play a card is giving in and loses their stakes/goal.<br/><br/>ENDING A SCENE<br/>When either side can't or won't play more cards, the scene is over. Whoever played the last card gains their scene goal. However, win or lose the scene, the initiating character suffers some kind of setback. Their opponent gets to declare a narratively appropriate setback for the initiating character. The GM and table are final arbiter of what a narratively appropriate setback is. If multiple players were engaged in a scene, they all get a say in the setback.<br/><br/>STRATEGY<br/>Something that came up was the question of initiating player being at a disadvantage as they're going first and their opponent can simply pick the lowest card they have to beat them. That's the beauty of a card-based resolution: The player doesn't have to play a low card first. The cards are resources to spend however the player wants. They can play face cards on that first declaration, if they have them. This forces the other player to slap two cards down early to keep things going, which typically forces a stressed Aspect for more cards. In the couple of dozen hands I've played with people there doesn't seem to be any correlation between going first and ultimately winning or losing the hand. It more depends on the cards you're dealt and the strategy you use.<br/><br/>That's basically it. If you're willing, give it a try with someone. Doesn't need to be supers, that's just the original form from With Great Power, so it's what I went with here. Should work for most conflict types. Fairly fast and fun once you get into it.<br/><br/>So tell me what you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435043/#Comment_435043" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T13:58:16+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  1:58PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds pretty well thought out, and reasonably playable.<br/><br/>My main issue with this kind of resolution (although it can absolutely appropriate for some types of game) is that it doesn't take fictional positioning into account at all. <br/><br/>One of the problems this can bring along is people slapping down cards but neglecting to narrate anything, since they know that ultimately it doesn't change a great deal about what's happening.<br/><br/>There could also be mismatches between the fiction and the players' resources (for instance, in the story your character is winning the conflict, and clearly has the upper hand, but you're out of cards - what do you do now?).<br/><br/>Otherwise, it looks pretty good to me, especially if you say you've playtested it some.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435045/#Comment_435045" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T14:17:21+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  2:17PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2014 2:23PM by liblarva.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the extra eyeballs.\n<blockquote>This sounds pretty well thought out, and reasonably playable.<br/><br/>My main issue with this kind of resolution (although it can absolutely appropriate for some types of game) is that it doesn't take fictional positioning into account at all.</blockquote>\nHow do you mean? Like coming into a fight hurt or the like? If so, yes, there will be a bit more, like playing with hand size or wild cards, or touches here and there to tweak this general idea. I was thinking the Aspect stress component would be damage and the like. Each time an Aspect takes stress (to draw cards) the player has to narrate the effect, most likely based off the opponent's last card and narration. But that's still fuzzy-land.\n<blockquote>One of the problems this can bring along is people slapping down cards but neglecting to narrate anything, since they know that ultimately it doesn't change a great deal about what's happening.<br/><br/>There could also be mismatches between the fiction and the players' resources (for instance, in the story your character is winning the conflict, and clearly has the upper hand, but you're out of cards - what do you do now?).</blockquote>\nThese are connected.<br/><br/>It's a requirement that there's narration attached. Everything said (and played with a card) is either true in the fiction or was attempted in the fiction but failed (beat by another card), so every declaration (and card) would definitely have an impact. Each exchange of cards is task resolution while the total hand is conflict/scene resolution.<br/><br/>The story is dictated by the cards. They're connected. So to say "in the story your character is winning the conflict, and clearly has the upper hand, but you're out of cards" is a contradiction. If your opponent is out of cards, they've lost the conflict and you've won. Each card is accompanied by a bit of escalating narration, so whoever is winning with the cards is winning in the story.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435046/#Comment_435046" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T14:25:24+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  2:25PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2014 2:31PM by James_Stuart.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

Something like conceding on that action and doing something else, but still that's fuzzy-land.<br/><br/>Aspect stress would carry though the entire story and you only have a limited number of Aspects and stress to use. It's basically you choosing to take lasting damage to get more cards now.<br/><br/>Since you and Paul both commented on the lack of fictional tie-in, I must have not explained that part well enough, or we have different definitions for "tied to the fiction". Each card is a narrative statement that becomes true unless a higher card is played. That narration is still in the fiction, it's just superseded by the higher card. So one character swings to hit another (plays a card), their target dodges and hits back (plays a higher card). The higher card doesn't prevent the swing, it prevents the effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435048/#Comment_435048" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T14:48:51+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  2:48PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could be wrong but I believe Paul and James are more concerned about the conflict res flowing with the fiction that sits <i>around</i> the scene (before and after), as its context.

Everything hangs in the balance. They draw cards.<br/><br/>The first warrior princess has, unbeknowst to anyone, smeared her horse's neck with the blood of a Quirine Demon, something that the second princess's horse is deadly afraid of, and, when she gets close enough to smell it, is likely to spook her and throw off her rider.<br/><br/>She's also been studying a different style of swordsmanship, which her opponent's training may be vulnerable against. Although she is nowhere near as good at that as her usual tactics, if she senses that she's losing the upper hand, she might switch to it in order to get an angle against her opponent.<br/><br/>The second princess has learned that the first princess's father is dead. She will reveal this truth at a sensitive moment in the duel to throw off her opponent.<br/><br/>She's also wearing a layer of fairie's hair under her corselet - she hopes that her opponent is using an iron sword, which could shatter if it makes contact with the hair.<br/><br/>When the duel starts, she sees that the sun is setting behind the trees. She maneuvers her horse so that her opponent has to face into the sun, because she knows that her enemy suffered some eye damage ten years ago, and will find it extremely unpleasant.<br/><br/>How do any of these things affect the odds of the outcome of the duel? <br/><br/>If you're cool with them being just Colour, you're all set. But, if not, it's a challenge to work into this system, particularly with things like the hidden fairie's hair. Let's say I want to narrate that I'm wearing the hair after all... do I also have the authority to narrate that you're using an iron sword? If not, who decides?<br/><br/>As for "being in a winning position, but out of cards", picture this:<br/><br/>My character is a strong, powerful man. Yours is a weakling, inexperienced with warfare. We get into a fight, and you're already wounded, tired, and I knock the sword out of your hand. I play a high card and say how I knock you down to the ground. You play a slightly higher card, and describe how you quickly roll out of the way, just barely escaping death.<br/><br/>However, that was my last card. It's now my turn again, so I have to go... but I have no cards left, so I must somehow give in. Why? Why am I surrendering now?<br/><br/>It's not an insurmountable problem (in this case, the smaller dude should have narrated an action that doesn't just allow him to escape death but ALSO potentially win the duel), but it's one you have to be careful to avoid when you're playing.<br/><br/>More importantly, though, there's little incentive to narrate at all if you already know the outcome (if you're the next person in line, and you already know you can't beat the card just played, for example, or because you have the highest card in play and your opponent only has one left).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435057/#Comment_435057" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T16:59:54+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  4:59PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2014 5:02PM by liblarva.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Example 1...<br/><br/>As for "being in a winning position, but out of cards", picture this...</blockquote>\nThese are both basically examples of insisting on playing through conflicts that are foregone conclusions. Both so heavily weighted to one side that they would be even more boring to game than they would be to read in fiction. Yes, I do get your point about carrying advantage into a conflict, and yeah, something like that should come in. But your hyperbolic examples would be boring no matter the system.<br/><br/>Though the second example has a slightly interesting question at the end. If the stakes are someone winning the duel, then whoever wins the hand wins the duel. Simple as that. But how you ask? Use your imagination. That's the point. How can a beta male possibly beat a hyper-thyroid alpha male in a fight? The beta male outsmarts him. Tricks him. Trips him up. Gains the sympathy of a nearby noble for refusing to give up, and the noble steps in. It's up to the players and the GM. Wasn't there a scene similar to that in the first Captain America? Weakling Steve Rogers "won" a fist fight because he refused to give up.<br/><br/>Put another way, in D&amp;D why don't you keep fighting after you've run out of hit points? Because according to the rules, you're unconscious or dead when you run out of hit points. Here you lose the conflict once you can't or won't play a card. The rules cover the "what" not the "how", if you take my meaning. Yes, the rules say you lose, but it's up to the players at the table to describe it.\n<blockquote>More importantly, though, there's little incentive to narrate at all if you already know the outcome (if you're the next person in line, and you already know you can't beat the card just played, for example, or because you have the highest card in play and your opponent only has one left).</blockquote>\nFirst, if you have one card left and you can't beat the last one played, you lose. There's no narrating as you can't play another card. So that's not a bug, that's exactly how it's supposed to work.<br/><br/>Second, ties go to whoever played last. You play an ace then I play an ace, I win because I played the last card. Unless you have another ace, you're done. But I still have to narrate dropping my ace, just like you had to narrate your ace. Why? Cause them's the rules. That's how the game's played.<br/><br/>But at a few points here it comes down to you insisting that the fiction and the cards are separate, they're not. One enforces the other. Both players are describing their actions and how they're trying to win their goal as they play cards. Whoever plays the last card, who narrated last, that action stands and finishes the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435060/#Comment_435060" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T17:12:20+00:00" title="July  9, 2014  5:12PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you have is mechanics which inform the fiction.

I just wanted to test out this bit of the mechanics qua mechanics first. Yes, I know it's not done yet.<br/><br/>One thing I have found fiddling with this some more with actual hands is that if there's more than a two card difference between each side, it's basically a guarantee the larger hand size will win. Unless you get a fluke like a run of low value cards in the larger hand size vs a run of high value cards in the smaller hand size. So any kind of damage or prep that affects hand size would have to be no more than +/-1.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir">@AlbeyAmakiir</a>, I'm really not sure what you mean about conflicts "ending when they're not really ready to". Unless you're talking about the big scene that's the climax of the story, you're generally not seeing conflicts drag out, not outside the pure adrenaline movies at least, and that's definitely not what I'm going for. The above is a baseline for how the thing should generally work: cards, card interaction, resetting the stack, ending the conflict, and the setback. As for how many cards and what other little twists and turns might be added to flesh things out, I don't know. I honestly haven't gotten that far yet. <br/><br/>I do know that I want to have something in place that lets you "bank" cards for later, specifically the climax of the story. Something like winning a conflict with two or more cards in your hand. So there will be escalation in that regard. I guess you could have something like keeping what's left in your hand for the next conflict. But that would mean a whole lot of giving in... which could totally work. Play a few low cards for a token engagement with a conflict, intentionally lose, keep your best cards, then draw up to whatever the hand size should be. Could work.<br/><br/>Part of the thing I'm shooting for over all is emulating the way stories function, so there's really not a lot of huge impact from one scene to the next (mechanically) as far as getting hit or shot or running across broken glass really has. In one scene a barefoot John McClane (Die Hard) has to run across broken glass to avoid being blown up, the next scene he's picking glass out of his feet, the next scene he's walking a bit slower with a limp. Sure, he has to deal with the problem (picking the glass out of his feet) but it's not a huge hinderance going forward. Similar to With Great Power, the idea is to lose early to win later. In that scene he's only suffering a temporary setback in the story, while he's getting stronger structurally or in the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435071/#Comment_435071" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-09T22:03:27+00:00" title="July  9, 2014 10:03PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you add a rule which makes it tempting to "give in" and willingly suffer defeat, I think that would strengthen this mechanic immeasurably. It would fix most of my issues with it, actually.<br/><br/>As for the number of cards, I think it would be unwise to mess with that. Maybe you could add or subtract a card under rare circumstances, but probably the easiest way to handle this is just to limit your hand size to 5 cards.<br/><br/>So, at the beginning of any conflict, you draw five cards, plus cards for whatever advantages/benefits you want to include, and then discard down to five. <br/><br/>This allows you to "carry over" good cards from previous conflicts very easily, but without destroying the balance of things.<br/><br/>What happens in a many-on-one conflict, though?

I got the same replies in that thread as you did here, but I think they kind of missed the point of why and how to play the game, because it has a different perspective.<br/><br/>The only thing I would change is the declaration and who will play in turn. Instead of having one player play a card at the time, I would make everyone play their card at the same time. Perhaps you could have a pre-narration before playing the card and a post-narration after seeing who had the highest card. The one who plays the lowest cards must play yet another card (if several have the lowest cards, then they all play another card). What I mean with pre-narration is to include someone else in the description. The post-narration is instead about what the result is for that action.\n<blockquote>Each participant draws five cards from a standard poker deck, with Jokers in. If the GM has multiple characters in a scene, each one gets to draw 5 cards. </blockquote>\nI dunno how you got got that number, when I started to play descriptive-heavy games, I noticed that the descriptions started to fade after 5-7 actions, and people started instead to concentrate more on telling the results of the game mechanics. So I think 4-5 could be a good number for the number of cards to draw.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>And finally: no one can win in either your and mine system before a certain point.

Fictional positioning, at least from how I understood it, is to take ownership of something in the fiction, usually through creating it. If I say that there is a scarecrow on the field, then there is a scarecrow on the field unless someone dispute that fact right away.<br/><br/>I've talked about this before, but to be able to make a game that makes the participants doing descriptions, the system should leave a gap between what happens in the fiction and what happens in the the rule system, and let the participant tie those two together by doing a description of what's happening. What this basically means is that no one should understand what happens if they are only are using the system.<br/><br/>That is what this system is about, in my opinion, and trying to talk about how fictional positioning should affect the game system in this case is purely seeing things from the wrong perspective.\n<blockquote>If you're cool with them being just Colour, you're all set.</blockquote>\nColor is when it has nothing to do with anything: it's just something to spice things up with. If the game system says I kill you, and I describe it as I kick you to the moon, that's just color. I could as easily have described that I shot you in your face instead. The description of how, in this case, doesn't matter. It's just color (even though it sets the mood). The descriptions in this system matters, because it's fictional positioning. It's information that the opposition have to take into account when they are describing what's happening.<br/><br/>What this means is that instead of describing and having the system take that into account, the participants interpret the system output for their descriptions. In this suggested system, it's partial success towards the final outcome, but outcome can be objects, emotions, time, inspiration for new scenes or whatever that the system puts out for the participants to interpret into their descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435087/#Comment_435087" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T09:15:04+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  9:15AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some thoughts on this:<br/><br/>1.

People latched on Mamet's use of the word "failure" and mistakenly assumed it meant the character(s) never succeeded at their stated goal, rather than accept that he meant win or lose, they suffered some kind of setback as the Butcher (and so many others) suggests. Though yes, it's far more interesting and dramatic and engaging when the scene answer is "no, and".<br/><br/>Check my proposed system again. And noodle what's happening with the cards and scene resolution. As stated just above, the vast majority of the time when you play a card, that's going to be a "no, and" response. "The goon shoots the teller in the face," plays card. "Batman throws a batarang to disarm the goon," plays higher card ("no, and"). <br/><br/>There are two possibilities for the scene ending: "yes, but" along with "no, and". The initiating character is generally at a slight disadvantage for a few reasons, pushing the percentage toward the "no, and" side of things. Furthermore, the "giving in" to keep cards mechanic pushes things hard toward the "no, and" resolution.<br/><br/>Magically, just like the story structure I'm going for at the scene level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435098/#Comment_435098" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T11:03:59+00:00" title="July 10, 2014 11:03AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            liblarva,<br/><br/>If that's what you mean by honouring Mamet's "failure", then I'm even more confused.

Both of these are true of most games out there: from Dogs in the Vineyard to In a Wicked Age... to Principia to Solar System to Beast Hunters to combat in (at least some versions of) D&amp;D, etc, etc.<br/><br/>We also have much more nuanced versions, like Polaris.<br/><br/>What I found intriguing about your point in the other discussion was the idea that we could design a game where the protagonist really DOES fail most of the time, and still have it be fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll keep reading and see what you come up with!<br/><br/><br/>Rickard,<br/><br/>It looks to me like we agree here.

Those aren't opposites. One flows from the other.<br/><br/>The general structure would work something like this.<br/><br/>The players and GM agree they're playing a murder mystery. Say a police procedural. The players are cops. Two sets of partners. Like good storytellers and players, they've set their characters in slightly opposing ways to each other, both within a partner pairs and across the partner pairs. Each character will have whatever aspects, relationships, traits they need (no idea on the specifics there yet, but that's the direction to go).<br/><br/>At the start of the session the GM drops a hot new case in their laps. There's a murdered woman in the park. The cops are sent to investigate. Turns out it's some political mucky-mucks daughter so there's pressure from above, both to get it done right and get it done fast. That's the heap of pregnant conflict waiting to happen, the inciting incident is when it's dropped in their laps.<br/><br/>Now the PCs are free to pursue their agendas. Tony set up his character as the interviewer, the closer. So he goes to work the crowd. William set up his character as the proper sleuth, modern Sherlock wannabe. So he goes to work the physical evidence at the scene. Tracy set up her character as the smiling people person, the face. She goes to talk to the media...<br/><br/>Like any good group game, each character would/should have some level of niche protection and can contribute in unique ways to the story. The GM makes things hard on the characters, pounding at them with twists and turns (those setbacks and playing the NPCs the PCs are opposing). <br/><br/>Just like PTA, the game would open with a teaser (GM dropping the inciting incident in the players' laps), and from there the PCs would be free to go from there. Maybe around the table once or twice, each player calling a spotlight scene for their character, then back to the GM for the cliffhanger/plot twist at the end of an act. Then back around the table once or twice for act 2... on through to the climax and tag/denouement.<br/><br/>New and different? As stated in the other thread, there certainly are games which hit a few of the things I'm after, but none that hit them all. Again, you're making assumptions and judgements <i>about the whole, finished game that you think this will be</i> based on <i>the napkin outline of the resolution mechanic</i>. You might not want to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435115/#Comment_435115" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T14:26:39+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  2:26PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all, I have this feeling this thread might get angry, so let's try to keep this thread chill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435116/#Comment_435116" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T14:30:56+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  2:30PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>each player calling a spotlight scene for their character, then back to the GM for the cliffhanger/plot twist at the end of an act.</blockquote>Ok so where does the card-based conflict res occur?  <br/>It represents the crux of the Spotlight Scene, so near the end of that, I assume?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435117/#Comment_435117" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T14:45:11+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  2:45PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.

But here's the thing. I don't think they are mutually exclusive. You can have all three. Story, drama, and emergent play. Ultimately that's what I'm shooting for. The resolution mechanic is definitely the emergent play piece here.<br/><br/>What if they all fail? Wonderful. Now that's three setbacks to propel the story and drama forward. And if the GM and players are in the zone, those setbacks will also be dramatically tied to the characters. A narc Tony's character had dealings with in the past. A reporter Tracy's character has dealt with before. A murderer's signature William has seen before. You can't always do that of course, but you can try.<br/><br/>That's basically how story structure works though. The character(s) fail forward. Go around the table for the first act, players dealing with their setbacks, and when it gets back to the GM he does something like the tilt from Fiasco. A big reveal or cliffhanger, plot point or whatever that twists and propels the story into act two. And you go around the table again, with the players calling scenes, etc.<br/><br/>The idea is story structure, dramatic engagement of the characters, and some fun emergent play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435123/#Comment_435123" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T16:45:25+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  4:45PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright.

I would like to see it getting more polished.<br/><br/><b>My few cents to ponder upon:</b><br/>You have aspects in your game, why not use them prior to conflict? Let say each side gets 5 cards, but each can draw an extra card for each aspect that applies? Combine this with each getting an extra card for any advantage they prepared prior to the conflict and you get a hand of cards that you down size to 5. <br/><br/>Why not make each card suit a different Approach (as in FAE)? Maybe each approach would have a a value on character sheet? So Batman is much better (+2) at Planned approach but worse (-2) at Reckless (or Forceful). So each time he plays a card he modifies the value by his approach rating. This way he can get more use of the Planned card suits and less of the reckless. <br/>The way I see it, when you only modify the play the card down (so 5 becomes 7 for stealthy approach), but once it hits the table, the value resets? I am not sure about this one, maybe the top card should always be modified?<br/><br/>Let's steal from card games. How about each side in conflict would have a trump card? They can play trump card of any value to beat a high card, but this gives them <b>Yes, but</b> outcome. This would replace the "play to cards" move to take it down.<br/><br/>How about you can draw an extra card at a cost of Aspect.

Fate points are either draw two new cards (+2) or discard and redraw your entire hand (reroll). You gain a bonus for your action based on the suits you have in your hand. Each suit is an action: Attack = clubs, Overcome = spades, Create advantage = hearts, Defend = diamonds.

Someone in the crowd starts acting weird and runs away. He recognizes someone in the crowd because they're a snitch, crook turned legit, someone he's busted before. The only eye witness was in the middle of committing a different crime.<br/><br/>William- finds something but collects it improperly or it's lost in the chain of custody. He finds some bit of evidence but the lab's got a backlog, with the pressure from above he's got to make it happen now. He finds something he really doesn't want to find on the political kid's body like drugs, gang tattoos, signs of torture, cutting, track marks. <br/><br/>Tracy- some reporter asks her about a previous case that went south. She's taken off guard by a question and lets something slip or yells at a reporter on live TV. The reporters seem to know more about the case than she does and embarrass her.<br/><br/>To make these more dramatic you could have any of the above NPCs having a connection to the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435147/#Comment_435147" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T06:38:12+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  6:38AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Of course, in my mind, the means by which the dynamic of bringing in mechanical impact of preparation has already been spoken into being: the system has Aspects. Preparing should involve acquiring Aspects for a character, a place, or a situation.<br/><br/>My gut says that it might be worth it for <a href="/forums/profile/librarva">@librarva</a> to check out Bayn's <b><a href="http://danielbayn.com/wushu/" rel="nofollow">Wushu</a></b> RPG, because the evolving dynamic of an ongoing exchange of successes which accumulate is pretty core to the mechanic there, which involves an exchange of dice pools until the current effective Threat in terms of number of successes has been accumulated. This system exchanges a fixed Threat with an active hand (or hands) held by the GM. I dig that.<br/><br/>My own feeling is that the GM should probably only have a single hand of cards, no matter the number of GMCs in the scene, as it were. In that case, the GM has to set a needed/desired stake just like anyone else, but might have the advantage of more elements to narrate card play through.<br/><br/>This does lead me to an interesting thought, though: there's really no reason this mechanic has to be attached to a GM-full game. Stake-setting mechanics are really amenable to distributing narrative control around the group. Lift a little bit from <b>Wushu</b> regarding scene pacing and resolution, lift a bit from <a href="http://universalisrpg.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>Universalis</b></a> for ideas on how to turn successes/resources into Aspects attached to things, and I think you could do something terribly interesting with this.<br/><br/>(Tapping Aspects for a hand refresh definitely should go along with some kind of evocation of that Aspect in a narrative sense, but I don't think it needs to go along with some kind of change in the stakes or scene. You're deliberately calling on your reserves of character ability in some area, so you've got a built-in motivation to narrate it in. That really handles itself in application, I think.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
