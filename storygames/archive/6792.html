I wasn't there to see it used (Gregor did the demos) so I am keen to get feedback from anyone who read it, watched it, or most of played it, to see what I can improve for the next version (which we will have on the website as a download).<br/><br/>So, did anyone here play in a Solipsist demo? If so how was it? Did you like it? Hate it? Understand it? If you own Solipsist or have played it elsewhere did the Demo do a good job of communicating an interesting part of Solipsist play?<br/><br/>Specific questions\n<ol>\n<li>Did the rules presented in the demo (confronting the Shadow, changing reality) make sense as provided?</li>\n<li>Was the situation (attacked by dog-demons) interesting?</li>\n<li>Did you succeed or fail at making the change and overcoming the attack?</li>\n<li>If you failed were the consequences (or non-consequences) of failing clearly explained in a way that made it clear that it was a minor setback at most and fun was still to be had?</li>\n</ol>\nAlso if you played through and made an interesting change of reality, please let me know what it was.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
