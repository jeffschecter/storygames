(I count Fiasco and DitV as obvious influences.)<br/><br/>I came to the table with this procedure:\n<blockquote>1. Someone starts. When it's your turn, briefly narrate a life stage in your character's background.  This might be a burning wheel lifepath, or something like it.  You must state what your character is trying to do.  ("I'm leaving my village and heading to the city.  I want to apply at the lyceum.")<br/><br/>2. The player to your left becomes your Challenger, and they describe a challenge your character faces in that life stage - physical, emotional, relational.<br/><br/>3. Flip a coin to determine whether it goes well or badly for you.  If you do, describe what happens; if you don't, the Challenger does.<br/>The description should stop short of how this affects your character on a long-term basis, and it should be compatible with the remaining life stages.<br/><br/>4. Each other player, in turn, describes a lesson your character might learn from this experience, and an accompanying trait.  (e.g. For example, 'Cynical: love only leads to heartbreak.')  The lesson should be general enough to apply to future situations, rather than something specifically about the challenge just faced.<br/><br/>5. Choose one of the offered lessons, say it out loud, and write it down.  Disregard the others.  The lesson might be held consciously, an overt statement of the character's belief, or it might be completely unconscious.  ("I am unworthy of love.")  Totally contradictory lessons are a-okay.<br/><br/>6. Play passes to the left.<br/><br/>7. Repeat until everyone has the requisite number of life stages (e.g. 2-5 times around the table). Choose a different Challenger each time.</blockquote>\n<br/>We play a lot of BW, so I suggested we all pick four lifepaths (NRBH, so some of the lifepaths were made up on the spot) in advance, and then use the procedure to find lessons.  We chose to skip the 'Born' lifepaths for some reason, so we went around the table three times.<br/><br/>I may post more details later, but there were a few thoughts in the aftermath:<br/><br/>1. We had a good time, and would do it again.<br/>2. We all felt that we could play the characters that resulted.<br/>3. There would need to be some adaptation to a particular system.  Like, if you used this for BW, there could be any number of ways the 'lessons' map to parts of the BW character. At the very least, it produced a goldmine to choose from.<br/>4. As is, it doesn't produce a 'party', we didn't have the characters know one another, nor were they hooked into a particular situation.  (I had only said, "They all meet in a tavern after lifepath 4.")<br/>5. It was utterly delightful to get other people's suggestions of the lessons our characters might learn. <br/>6. In a group of 4, there's enough variety that the player still has a lot to choose from. The characters didn't feel alien at all, just enriched by everyone's suggestions.<br/>7. I felt like I cared about other people's characters.<br/><br/>So, to repeat, I'd love to hear people's experiences with this (try it for yourselves), or with anything similar.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417798/#Comment_417798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T07:43:42+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  7:43AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2013 7:43AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love when people invent stuff about my character because they usually turn up much better than I could have imagined alone. It's been lovely when I manage to, often by mistake, create a kind of workshop for brainstorming characters together. I also usually tell people, before we play, that they may add things about my character if they feel like it. It seldom happens. I guess that's because people think that they will step over any boundaries, perhaps breaking any character ideas that I got.<br/><br/>The thing is, you can't think in those terms. You must be leaving your character open to be able to accept the other's ideas.<br/><br/>It's also important to have a good group relation. If I can't trust my fellow comrades, like if someone makes up that my character sticks bunny rabbits up my ass as a hobby, then it's all broken.\n<blockquote>4. As is, it doesn't produce a 'party', we didn't have the characters know one another, nor were they hooked into a particular situation. (I had only said, "They all meet in a tavern after lifepath 4.")</blockquote>\nOne cool thing used in <b>Star Wars d6</b>, that I use in all the games, is that the players have to come up with why they are together. What has happened in the past? What are their common goals? Tell them that they are in a tavern and then ask why. Or in a gun fight. Or falling down from an airship. Why, oh why? And why is that volcano active? Why is one character holding a wand? Why, why, why? Brainstorming through directed questions, and on the positive side: you also create the first scene at the same  time.\n<blockquote>7. I felt like I cared about other people's characters.</blockquote>\nYes, to make a player create something is an easy way of creating an investment. You almost always get a connection to something you created. I use this if I want to create a connection between a NPC and a player, by brainstorming the character with the player. Other examples: if each character creates a separate story (as in all those rotating "GM-less" games), you will care more about that character if you were part in creating it (<b>Polaris</b> uses this). Another example: if you want the group of characters to be tight, like if you're playing a special op force, let the players help each other in creating characters. This is used in <b>Spirit of the Century</b>, where one player writes a short history about their character and then the next player writes their character into that story, and by doing that giving aspects to the first player. I don't know how tight that makes the group, because I haven't played the game, but it's a nice idea.<br/><br/>Great thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417799/#Comment_417799" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T07:56:49+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  7:56AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Rickard!

If you have a feeling for the other characters in the group right from the start, getting them to know each other is much more easy. I've never done it that way, but I've created characters with other players and it always made introducing the group easier.<br/><br/>I have a group where, as much as I like the people, the mere thought of creating characters that way makes me flinch. Not in the bunny rabbit up the ass-way, but we have such different ideas of what makes a good character. We play well enough together, but I'm not sure how well the exercise works in a group made up out of power gamers and people who love their characters to have weaknesses.
