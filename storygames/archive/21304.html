I wouldn't really prefer a forum post roleplay since it seems much too slow for the system I am comfortable with.<br/>-I am fairly new to RPGs like this. I only have slight experience with the Fate system, and I have never GMed a game before, so someone will have to be the GM.<br/>-I won't always be able to play since I am a teen who still goes to Middle School ( I'm young sue me ) so of course on weekdays I can't really play until about 4:00Pm, not counting after school stuff and Homework, so the group will have to have a flexible schedule.<br/>-I am very smart and open minded, so I am willing to learn anything that grabs my attention.<br/>-I have the erratic and joking personality for a Fate game.<br/><br/>If you are interested please let me know! If we can get at least 3 total people in the group then maybe we could find a time to get together on a platform and create characters together as session 1. Thanks for giving me the chance to join you guys!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
