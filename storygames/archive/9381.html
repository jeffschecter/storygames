I got a friend of mine who did marketing for a few different anime publishers (currently working for a company that makes green tea) to talk about small-scale marketing techniques and marketing to anime fans for the better part of an hour. His is kind of an outside perspective when it comes to RPGs, and I'm very curious what you folks think of his ideas on the subject.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
