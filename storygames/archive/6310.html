I've cross-posted this in a few places, but especially wanted to get some more small-press type feedback.<br/><br/>Are you entering in the <a href="http://www.ennieawards.com/publishers.html" rel="nofollow">ENnies</a> this year? As a new judge this year, its been curious to see the companies that have and have not entered (thus far, I should say). I know some publishers see a benefit or do it for fun, and some don't see the point. I'd just like to hear your thoughts on it. I'm an ENnies judge, not the organizer, so you aren't going to hurt my feelings. I'd just like to hear some honest feedback about if you are entering anything this year, why or why not, and what might happen to change that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139698/#Comment_139698" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T05:11:02+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  5:11AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I already answered <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=8737245" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.)<br/><br/>But I'm also interested in what people here have to say!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst" title="zacharythefirst"><img alt="zacharythefirst" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zacharythefirst">zacharythefirst</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139704/#Comment_139704" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T05:35:45+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  5:35AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw that Jason.

Also, I think non-traditional games are increasingly becoming more visible and known among mainstream roleplaying audiences, with more traditionally looking/feeling products like Burning Wheel/Empires and Spirit of the Century leading the way.  Honestly, even though I don't have a product to submit this year, I think the success of  small press games in "mainstram" roleplaying awards like the ENnies has and can continue to be an important part of that process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139732/#Comment_139732" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T08:21:01+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  8:21AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I didn't know that nominations were opening.

Why not!?  It's an honor just to be nominated!  Although, well, you essentially have to submit your own product.  For a podcast, it's a good way to reach a new audience, and only costs postage and some CDs.  I didn't realize this at the time of submission but judges like Zach sometimes mention the products they are reviewing at their own blogs or wherever so the potential to expand the audience isn't necessarily related to making the judges' cut.      <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139760/#Comment_139760" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T10:36:38+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 10:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have anything to submit this year, but having had an incredible experience when I did submit to the 2006 ENnies, I have a couple cents I'd like to toss into the discussion. The judges for the ENnies are selected by popular vote. These folks are folks that people listen to, in and out of the context of the ENnies. When you submit to the ENnies, you put your work in front of these judges. Even if you don't win, even if you aren't nominated, if any of these five judges like what they see, they'll talk about it and people <i>will</i> listen. People who you may never have reached otherwise. It's far better to win over a judge than it is to win the ENnie itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139784/#Comment_139784" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:52:34+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:52AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2008 11:54AM by Parthenia.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>3) The cost of submitting is pretty high, contributing 6+ free copies of a product for an outside chance of making the finals.</blockquote>\nI think you can submit pdf's if you sell your product as a pdf.

Why not!?  It's an honor just to be nominated!  Although, well, you essentially have to submit your own product.  For a podcast, it's a good way to reach a new audience, and only costs postage and some CDs.  I didn't realize this at the time of submission but judges like Zach sometimes mention the products they are reviewing at their own blogs or wherever so the potential to expand the audience isn't necessarily related to making the judges' cut.<br/>Mel<br/><br/>I do try to update as I get products on my blog.  I'm really big on the judges being open, straightforward, and communicative.  I know its an award that might not matter to everyone, but it matters enough to the folks who send stuff in for and follow it.  Knowing that it isn't just being hoarded or glanced at and thrown aside is the best way I can think of to grow trust in it.<br/><br/>(and yes, I did receive the Virtual Play CDs.
