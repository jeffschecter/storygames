The others players take on these witness roles on an ad hoc basis.<br/><br/>At a mechanically triggered point in the game, the case goes to court, whereupon two of the players who were taking the roles of the witnesses now take on the role of divine &amp; diabolical lawyers, each arguing their case for possession of the deceased's soul. The 'cop' players now take on the roles of the witnesses on an ad hoc basis, etc. The structrure of the story is very heavily influenced by (i.e. stolen from) the 'Law &amp; Order' TV series.<br/><br/>One sticking point I'm having is how to start the investigation; in Law &amp; Order, there is always a murder and the cops investigate whodunnit, but I can't quite see the room for that in this game. In dealing with a deceased's soul, where does the 'mystery' come in? How do you pick a client? How does the investigation progress? I did flirt with the idea of making every client a suicide of some description, but that seems a bit grim... would people enjoy that as a game premise? It would certainly be a good forum for picking apart moral questions, as in DitV.<br/><br/>A lesser problem is whether to make this a game strictly for 4 players; is it worth tweaking it to add other combinations of roles to make the game playable by 3 people or 5?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272598/#Comment_272598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-23T09:31:22+00:00" title="May 23, 2010  9:31AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not have the opening be exactly like a L&amp;O opening? Two shlubs from whatever city find a body. The first scene can be the angels and demons interacting with the mundane police (who see this kind of thing as routine) to discover the circumstances of their death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
