Go for it!</blockquote>A challenge! LOL<br/><br/>I give you the pitch for some imagined games:<br/><br/><b>LIFE</b><br/>This is a game about your life, done in two hours; childhood, puberty, work and marriage, love and loss, and finally; death. You weave the destiny of a man like yourself. But unlike real life; you get to play with that destiny ...<br/><br/><b>THE OFFICE</b><br/>You are playing a bunch of employees at an office, trying your best to stay on top, while keeping those around you reasonably friendly. In this game you are allowed to be as nasty and insincere as you ever dreamt of being, licking up the back of your boss in any conceivable way, and stealing any praise you can get.<br/><br/><b>MOTHER &amp; BABY</b><br/>You are mothers! You thrive in the company of other mothers, drinking coffee, gossiping and cooing your babies like real hen-mothers. Your babies are oh-so helpless, gullible, and sweet! And then, in the scenes back home, alone with your baby, you hate it. It belches, piss, defecate and scream endlessly! You are hard pressed not to mistreat it, and may do so ... - but back with the other mothers, you are a gullible saint again, with the other saints.<br/><br/><b>THE FAMILY</b><br/>In this game you play one day in the life of a family, leading up a family party that night. You start by choosing your family, then you build characters in that family, and then you play it.The game-play is close to free-form, intense, and focused on the mood of your chosen family.<br/><br/><div><b>* * *</b></div><br/><br/>Of course; I do not expect the average <i>player</i> to be baited by this, but grown up players may, and other grown ups may find that games are an interesting alternative to books and TV-series, when such games begin to surface ...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311413/#Comment_311413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T05:07:37+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  5:07AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2011 5:09AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>You are mothers!

So, "mundane" is informed by the view that life is what happens to you. "Mundane" is about living within an external destiny. It's about dealing with the entropy.<br/><br/>And this matches my experience with most of the slice-of-life comics I've read. They romanticize ennui.<br/><br/>By this definition, Nicotine Girls is not a mundane RPG. It's about desperate hope. The characters are protagonists trying to own a future for themselves despite life chaos, and despite possibly being unequal to the task. There's no ennui in it.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311462/#Comment_311462" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T09:41:47+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  9:41AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I admit <i>mundane</i> is a very slippery word. In fact, since I made the previous thread, I've been trying to pin down exactly what I meant. I think to one person, mundane simply means "not fantastical" or "not crafted to meet genre expectations," while to another it means "the details of daily life."<br/><br/>If I say I'd like to design a mundane game, I mean something like this: A game that contains no chance to act in an extraordinarily heroic or extraordinarily villainous way, or to derive pleasure primarily from the impossible, the extreme or the supernatural. I don't think this definition particularly prizes ennui or rules out desperate hope. But that's more a functional personal definition than one that could encompass this entire discussion.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to sell a mundane game. If I am pitching to someone who has rejected D&amp;D because of its subject matter, I tend to pitch the game as a challenge: Yes, you can enjoy role-playing. You were just playing the wrong game. Check this out.<br/><br/>Obviously, that bait is worthless on players who already enjoy RPGs and (ironically) find the subject matter of mundane games to be too extreme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312357/#Comment_312357" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-12T21:43:50+00:00" title="February 12, 2011  9:43PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, whether mundane or not, your game has to pitch something, right?<br/><br/>Even Seinfeld, which is a "show about nothing" presented itself as "funny", or even simply "original/unique". <br/><br/>I don't know if presenting it as a "challenge: you really CAN have fun with this, if you try hard enough!" is really ever a good way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_312544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312544/#Comment_312544" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T16:20:03+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  4:20PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2011 4:22PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is something that gets little (no?) mention when discussing games like these, and it's an odd omission ...<br/>- the love for human beings.<br/><br/>I've lived in this world for near to 50 years, and have seen nothing as fascinating as man.
