This weekend we're going to see the thrilling exploits of the DANGER PATROL.<br/><br/>While going through the Beta document, I noticed that the <b>Mystic</b> style seems to be missing some information, or hasn't had one of their Talents finished; it's in the Alpha documents, but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be the same in the Beta, or whether it's actually supposed to be as opened and freeform as it's written:<br/><br/><b>RIUTUAL MAGIC</b>: Should do something cool.<br/><br/>Can anyone part the mystic veil on this for me?  <i>The DANGER PATROL needs your help!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337440/#Comment_337440" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T11:02:50+00:00" title="August  6, 2011 11:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should check this old thread <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11836&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It has been that way for the Beta rules, too.<br/><br/>When my group and I have played DangerPatrol, we've always had a Mystic (or, I should say, the same guy keeps playing a Mystic, new character or not).<br/>The way I've been playing it has been you roll an appropriate ability, depending on what you're trying to magically do. Trying to unveil the secrets of the universe? Professor. Trying to create an obscuring cloud to hide your friends? Agent. etc. etc. Adding Danger and appropriate gear advantages as usual.<br/>The successes we treat as holds (a la Apocalypse World) that can be used as either bonuses to actions related to the effect, or to reduce the Danger accrued against an enemy, should that magical effect help stop their villainous onslaught.<br/>The kicker is, because this is supposed to be a Ritual, its the only thing in the game we say takes more than one turn. They declare it one turn, and it kicks in the next turn. That way they aren't constantly casting Rituals for all sorts of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337616/#Comment_337616" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T10:19:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2011 10:19AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this should be consolidated into the other thread, but I think it would be cool if Ritual Magic (and more talents in general) played around with Threat traits.<br/><br/>How about: When you apply hits to a threat, you can reduce your hits by two and choose one: prevent that threat from counting down at the end of this round, un-stage that threat from another threat, or reduce the resistance of that threat by one (before applying your hits.)  Resistance or Staging return to normal if you take a full hit or use this ability again.<br/><br/>It's too wordy, but it gives the feel of something that has to be maintained, and comes up situationally to foil elaborate schemes.  I'm not sure if it would be too powerful, since for many mixes of threats, it might be the only reasonable way to victory.  It might also work better as a Power?<br/><br/>I also like the idea of Ritual Magic somehow being done during the Suspense Scene, perhaps savings hits to spend them during a danger scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
