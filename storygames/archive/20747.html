The most popular games will avoid promoting any specific set of values, and only account for political trends when <i>not</i> doing so would send a stronger message. It's the case for games like D&amp;D and Pathfinder, and the case for monster licenses like Pokemon. Any game which does not follow this principle will never reach mass market.<br/><br/>But things have become more political than ever before in this interconnected society. You can no longer control context like before. Games designed for one region are leaking out to others they weren't and causing a lot of misunderstanding. You can't market your game to a specific audience because you have no control over who it reaches.<br/><br/>Which means Teletubbies all the way down (and even <i>that</i> didn't escape the ire of Christian radicals). Which means the most popular games will be the ones which only target people's base instincts to gamble, compete, collect, and socialize. Which means effort will be put into <i>removing</i> meaningful interpretations before release.<br/><br/>Of all the reasons 'Indie' games have not reached the mass market, this is the one that makes the most sense. I'm hard pressed to think of one Indie title which does not deal with challenging moral dilemmas, and often such is the core of play. There's nothing wrong with 'dumb' fun, and 'smart' fun isn't inherently <i>better</i>, but the market appeal for the latter will always be smaller.<br/><br/>Counterpoint?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455670/#Comment_455670" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T08:50:59+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  8:50AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That I'm completely disinterested in this debate and can only be bothered to participate insofar that its continuation irritates me mildly?<br/><br/>tl;dr - Yeah.

Even the Alignment system is not there to <i>raise</i> moral questions but to <i>answer</i> them preemptively.<br/><br/>Fiasco is a game which absolves one of the difficult questions by being about "powerful ambition and poor impulse control". It's also perhaps the most popular Indie title to date. And the new 7th Sea, the most successful RPG Kickstarter ever, <i>punishes</i> you for making the 'wrong' moral choice. Like Star Wars, which is also immensely popular.<br/><br/>Then there's My life With Master, Monsterhearts, Apocalypse World, Dogs in the Vineyard, Sorcerer, Shock, Bliss Stage, Cartel, Night Witches, Steal Away Jordan, Continuum, and many other 'Indie' titles which all <i>depend</i> on engaging raw emotional situations and/or considering moral dilemmas and questions of value. There's a reason the X Card came from this 'community'.<br/><br/>So it's not about having greater 'access' to value, meaning, and morals, but in simply being <i>about</i> those things.\n<blockquote>don't really think this merited a new thread,</blockquote>\nI don't care about the mass market.

I hope I don't have to define imagination and why it's essential to the medium, but I say this about criticality: Roleplaying as an activity between two or more people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> include criticality. <br/><br/>All concepts of we rely on such as "positioning," "shared imaginative space" and even "socialising" are rubbish - meaningless, vacant - without an element of critical engagement. To listen to what someone else is saying (or even to what you yourself say) and then to interpret and respond. <br/><br/>RPGs don't "allow" the critical player, they demand it. What is participation without criticality? An automated procedure? It's painting without surface; sculpture without form. <br/><br/>Try play Dogs in the Vineyard? Try play <i>anything</i>! <br/><br/>Sure, we can point to games that are potentially more 'mechanistic' in their procedures - more defined in what they want players to do at-table - but you just can't have an RPG that removes the concept. They all depend on criticality to function and for that reason can never, truly, be passive or predetermined experiences.  \n<blockquote><br/>Do they?

I'm not really under the impression that committing horrible violence in-character is any more frowned upon now than it was 20 years ago.\n<blockquote>How does the violence, sexism, and racism in the characters you <i>choose</i> to play (not) reflect on who you are as a person?</blockquote>Sure, it reflects on me if I choose to think about it, which I often don't.  But if I do, then yeah, it says that I'm curious about evil, and seek to better understand those who do it.<br/><br/>At the same time, I don't prioritize my freedom to engage in such exploration over the comfort of my fellow players.  I'm not going to play a sexist or racist character at a table where I don't know that everyone is okay with that.  So, I guess <i>that</i> choice reflects that I'm considerate.<br/><br/>That's what it says about me to <i>me</i>, anyway.  <i>Others</i> could assume that I'm alternately a sadist and a coward, I suppose.  But fuck them.<br/><br/>I'm just one player, though.  A game, which attempts to impact the experience of <i>many</i> players, is more complicated, I think.  Not more problematic, necessarily, but harder to tease apart whether it's problematic or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455807/#Comment_455807" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-26T16:36:08+00:00" title="August 26, 2016  4:36PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My 2\xa2 is that some games certainly promote or require more "moral dilemma" sort of content, but one of my friends, who has probably not played any indie story games, is running a 5e campaign that's full of racism, classism, and ambiguous morality.

(Or, at best, they have a little talk about changing the alignment on the character's sheet - "It looks like you're acting more Chaotic than Neutral here, Jane!" If so, though, the general understanding is that the label on the character sheet was an error. The player typically replies with something like, "Yeah, you're right! I guess this character is more Chaotic. I picked the wrong alignment; let me pencil that in.")<br/><br/>How does someone "challenge" D&amp;D alignment?

You can make D&amp;D racist, classist, and amoral because D&amp;D is a highly apolitical game. You can make D&amp;D classist in a way that something like <i>Prole: The Uprising</i> (a hypothetical game about worker's revolution with an inherently pro-Marxist bent) could never be.<br/><br/>The general trend of many indie games to hyper-focus on certain ideas and design around them should make it difficult to play them in ways that violate their themes. The same is not true for games that aim to be more open, more universalist. For example, I prefer to see Shadowrun as an anti-authoritarian game of anarcho-transhumanist anti-heroes. But there's nothing in the mechanics of Shadowrun that prevent you from playing megacorporate security trying to wipe out resistance, no penalty for actions that benefit the repressive megacorporate regime, and (usually) no moral implications of sacrificing your own humanity for power (only an increased susceptibility to magic). Shadowrun is an apolitical game, even when it's entire setting is politics-adjacent. These issues can exist, and the fluff even talks about them, but the game doesn't meaningfully engage with them, and doesn't force the players to either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455815/#Comment_455815" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-26T19:55:59+00:00" title="August 26, 2016  7:55PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2016 6:41AM by Potemkin.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>jangler, I feel like that's essentially what AnonAdderlan is trying to get at.

So they're in an occupied French village and I have to portray Nazis as more than targets (because the Resistance certainly didn't just gun down every German they saw; that would quickly become impossible). And so I read up a bunch about how Vichy authorities and German authorities and German military authorities of various sorts interacted, and I try to get it across and constantly, constantly keep close attention on what the consequences of events would be as best I can. If i fucked it up and was just being exploitative or shitty, I <i>hope</i> someone would say something about it, because that would be a misstep on my part and I'd never improve as a GM if nobody said anything.<br/><br/>Edit: I guess what I'm trying to say is that even if there's some larger political movement happening now (I don't see it, but I live in a super-conservative American state), RPGs, as folk art instead of performative public art, have access to another channel to work out these issues; you simply address them with your collaborators.

I don't think it's all <i>that</i> frequent, I don't think it's <i>completely</i> out of my control, and I don't think it's likely to be as consequential as the kind of shit many other people in RPG talk land have to put up with.  So, ehn, shit happens, any issue is gonna have some jerks on both sides, it sucks, but life goes on.<br/><br/>I would not be shocked to see some sort of community develop where a very specific version of sensitivity is all that's tolerated, and everything else is excoriated, but I would expect that community to be small and I don't think I'd be forced to deal with them.  I know <i>tons</i> of roleplayers and RPG designers who are <i>extremely</i> reasonable!<br/><br/>Example reasonableness:<br/><br/>I had a good conversation with Julia Ellingboe a few years back when I was trying to decide whether to play Steal Away Jordan.  I felt like it was supposed to simulate slavery history, and that to be an authentic part of such a simulation I'd have to speak in character in ways which, to our modern ears, would sound extremely racist.  And Julia was basically like, "No, you don't have to, the game doesn't rely on that, you get plenty out of the basic situations and rules without obsessing over historical authenticity in language."  And she was completely right.  <br/><br/>Initially, I think she didn't love the fact that I was introducing obstacles to playing her game, and I didn't love the fact that she didn't seem to get where I was coming from.  But we were both reasonable about it and eventually had a productive conversation without anyone being judged (AFAIK).<br/><br/>And I later played the game and really enjoyed the experience.  SAJ isn't some teaching tool that lectures you about slavery; all its characters are just people pursuing goals, and that's mainly what you do in play, and there are certainly opportunities to reflect on slavery, but no one's quizzing you or anything.  I'd say that players can kinda get out what they put in, or what they go in looking for, or something.  There's no one right way to play it, and I'm certainly not aware of Julia or anyone else who loves the game taking any dedicated action to tell anyone else they're playing it wrong.  <i>And this is a game about friggin' slavery.</i>  If there's tolerance and reasonableness and acceptance and shades of gray <i>there</i>, then I don't think the RPG hobby can <i>possibly</i> be in <i>too</i> overwrought a condition.  Or, well, that's what I hope, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455990/#Comment_455990" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-02T19:49:09+00:00" title="September  2, 2016  7:49PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2016 12:10AM by David_Berg.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I prefer discussion that sticks to the issues without wandering into attacks that are overly personal or completely superfluous, though.

Those of us with access to tons and tons of options can opt out of that with some effort, but I agree with Anon that the default is significantly predictable.  A lot of the fun is in seeing <i>how</i> the good guy wins or <i>how</i> the couple reconciles, not <i>whether</i> they do.<br/><br/>There's a popular intrigue show on right now where they killed off the main character and had several episodes without them.  I thought it dramatically improved the show, and I was crossing my fingers for the 1% chance that this character was <i>actually</i> dead, while knowing with 99% certainty that they'd reappear in the season finale.<br/><br/>I just watched the season finale last night.<br/><br/>Yep, they're back.<br/><br/>I'm sure the subject of just how actively or passively we consume such entertainment would be good debate fodder, but the most active possible interpretation is still a long way away from acting as a character or authoring their choices.<br/><br/>As for whether we "engage" with the social issues and moral dilemmas presented by our predictable entertainment, I'm not sure.  I think such movies and shows consistently tell us what was right and what was wrong via musical cues and other presentation techniques.  This intrigue show I've been watching often calls into question the value of violence and revenge and breaking the law to seek justice.  In just about every case, a more likable character is pitted against a less likable character.  When the less likable character gets their way, usually the outcome is bad, and the more likable character gets to close out the arc by lecturing them.  When the more likable character gets their way, the less likable character then feels troubled and goes off to do some processing which then never enters the story.  When the charming criminal kills people in the name of justice, it's cool -- when the stick-in-the-mud cop kills people in the name of the law, it's blind zealotry.  Viewers could certainly disagree if they wanted, but the show gives them zero incentive to -- once a conflict is done, it's done, and we're on to next week's, and nothing ever lingers with true ambiguity.  <i>And I would say this show is better on all these fronts than most.</i><br/><br/>When we roleplay, we certainly have the option to create a similar type of fiction and presentation.  But there are at least some games out there that nudge us not to, just like there are weird or independent films in the U.S. that nudge us to make up our own minds about what they mean.  I guess Anon's wondering whether such games will thrive or die.  Perhaps indie film can tell us the answer: neither.  Moral challenge RPGs will continue to putter along with their own niche audience just as thinky films do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_456636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456636/#Comment_456636" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T10:04:22+00:00" title="September 27, 2016 10:04AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2016 10:04AM by AnonAdderlan.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://twitter.com/radicalbytes/status/761625315936395264" rel="nofollow">Jonathan McIntosh (who you may have heard of) had this to say</a>:\n<blockquote>Devs say it's up to players to decide if internment camps are good or bad?! No. The question itself is political! Game developers like to pretend their narratives, scenarios and mechanics are politically neutral but that's never really the case. <b>Sometimes when game designers set up "player choices," the choice itself is immoral because it shouldn't be up to the player to make it.</b> Game designers want players to have \u201cfun" regardless of what "moral choices" they make. <b>As if psychopathic killer is just a \u201cplay style.\u201d</b> There\u2019re no significant consequences to immoral player choices. Maybe different weapons, paths or cutscenes but nothing that hinders \u201cfun." <b>If game designers want to include player choices with meaningful consequences they must be willing to significantly de-power the player</b>. If game designers are not willing to de-power players then their \u201cmoral choice\u201d mechanics are reduced to basically meaningless "play style." Meaningful \u201cplayer choice\u201d is severely limited (or non-existent) if the primary way players engage with the game world is by killing stuff. Game developers seem to think that \u201cto kill or not to kill\u201d is some kind of deep and morally ambiguous choice for players. It\u2019s really not. <b>The point here is that the \u201cplayer choice" itself is an artificial construct that carries political messages no matter what players choose</b>. Games can and should tell political stories but if developers want to do that, they gotta have the guts to present a point of view.</blockquote>\nSo players in games should not be <i>allowed</i> to make the 'immoral' choice.<br/><br/>Think about it.\n<blockquote>Tell you what, I will e-mail Jessica Price and ask her if she would be interested in discussing the portrayal of KKK members in my last campaign, a World of Darkness game set in 1921.

That said, I'd LOVE to hear how she feels when a GM does the same, and why she feels it's different. While you're at it, ask her how she feels about games like <a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13991.phtml" rel="nofollow">3:16 Carnage Amongst The Stars</a> (which can be reskinned for such play) or game designed to show how those racist beliefs and activities are maintained by peer pressure and harmful to the characters. Finally, if you feel up for it, ask her how she feels about representing other problematic subjects like pedophiles and rapists.<br/><br/>I don't want to engage her directly because I don't want to be accused of harassment, but considering nobody could ever mistake you for one of my followers, I feel safe in saying please go ahead.

You're selectively highlighting sentences to ignore what he is critiquing in the paragraph, which is the illusion that "player choice" is a politically neutral stance. In fact, while you seem to be critiquing him (<i>are you?</i> you just kind of quote him and then say "think about it"), isn't he, effectively, arguing for EXACTLY what you want later in the post? "Player choice" is the epitome of genre conventions in contemporary computer games, giving the players the illusion of making moral decisions when, ultimately, every decision a player could make returns them to the expected world of killing things, something that, as you say, has an emotional pay-off mostly because the player expects it. (I know that this is roleplaying forum, but I think it is important to remember that he's explicitly critiquing Deus Ex in this paragraph, <i>not</i> talking about roleplaying games) As he says in the non-highlighted sentences:<blockquote> If game designers are not willing to de-power players, then their \u201cmoral choice\u201d mechanics are reduced to basically meaningless "play style." Meaningful \u201cplayer choice\u201d is severely limited (or non-existent) if the primary way players engage with the game world is by killing stuff.</blockquote> Far from saying that the players should not be allowed to make moral choices, he seems to be arguing that "player choice" in computer games is an evasion, offering the illusion of engaging with political, social, and ethical questions, while ultimately just offering the player more of the same. Further, I think he's critiquing the way that all these mechanics work together to produce a narrative context where genocide ends up being presented as defensible a moral choice as any other. In this case, isn't it "breaking the social contract," as you put it, to develop a game that <i>doesn't</i> attempt to obfuscate itself behind this construct of "player choice," and instead openly take a political or moral stance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/OnlyAnAlligator" title="OnlyAnAlligator"><img alt="OnlyAnAlligator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/OnlyAnAlligator">OnlyAnAlligator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456646/#Comment_456646" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T15:33:11+00:00" title="September 27, 2016  3:33PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2016 3:43PM by OnlyAnAlligator.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And actually, as to your comments about Jessica Price, yes, she objects to a game about playing KKK members going around beating up minorities.

We went to see a Korean film, which was quite interesting. The trailer/advertising portrayed it as a happy, fun romantic comedy (which it was, for the most part). However, halfway through the film they introduced a dark, scary, quasi-horror storyline. <br/><br/>As an audience used to films which pick a genre and stick with it, it was fairly shocking. Suddenly the film took a dark turn!<br/><br/>I thought it was pretty interesting, and enjoyed the film, even though the contrast was somewhat jarring. So did my friends.<br/><br/>However, many, many filmgoers were shocked and appalled. They felt "tricked" or "misled", and felt it wasn't right or fair that this aspect of the film hadn't been revealed to them in the trailer.<br/><br/>I thought it was quite an interesting reaction. Must a trailer to a film really give away all its secrets? I'd like to think there's room for a few surprises (especially at an movie festival for independent films!).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456648/#Comment_456648" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T15:56:08+00:00" title="September 27, 2016  3:56PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have also been a few designers who have spoken of "laying traps" in their games.

But isn't that a perfectly acceptable criteria to judge me on? If all that matters is <i>my</i> internal satisfaction that I did something right, how will I ever improve? I promise I'm a self-satisfied twit who barely registers the world beyond the tip of my nose.   Only people who look past my own self-satisfaction will ever give me a judgment on my RPG performance worth having. If someone says "That satire didn't land; you blew it" on what level is my intent even relevant to their judgment? Why in the fucking world would I do anything when confronted with this opinion except to graciously thank them for their feedback and think about it seriously? Even if I conclude I was right and they were wrong, why is this particular criteria so horrible that we must frown and shake our heads at the possibility that someone might think it?<br/><br/>Again, please link 3 people who say that the portrayal of reprehensible people in RPGs is bad.

The <i>exact same game</i> can have drastically different results depending on who plays it regardless of the designer's intent.

But y'all bashing each other's arguments has nearly lost me.  I'm grateful for the evidence being offered in support of each position, but the "your reasoning is spurious" stuff is really detracting (for me, anyway).  I hope it doesn't devolve into pure conflict.<br/><br/>My personal takes on the latest subtopics:<br/><br/><b>Videogames vs tabletop RPGs</b><br/><br/>(A) Choosing between options scripted by someone else in a videogame and (B) authoring your own options in an RPG, are entirely different types of choices.  Ethically dubious behavior is possible in either case, but I'd level different sorts of critique.  I'd say the moral risk in "I did KKK stuff cuz the game made me" is more cowardice and the moral risk in "I responded to an open situation with KKK behavior" is more hate.  Note, though, that I say "risk" not "actuality".  Just because a player <i>could</i> be a thoughtless collaborator or a hateful bigot doesn't mean that they <i>are</i>.  To know one way or another in any given case, you'd have to be there (at minimum).<br/><br/>Some RPG play is more like videogame play in this respect (effectively choosing between options scripted by the GM or scenario) and some is more authorial.  So I see the span from (A) to (B) above as a spectrum.  It's hard to even know what sort of moral hazard is present just from the statement "in a tabletop RPG".  Might be just like a videogame, or it might be nothing like a videogame.<br/><br/><b>Opportunities for abuse</b><br/><br/>Let's say I make a game which features the KKK, and that the most obvious way to play it is for someone, GM or player(s), to act out the behaviors of KKK members.  Is this good, bad, or neutral?  Is whatever emerges in play my responsibility or not?  Does it depend on who I share the game with?  Does it depend on some blurb in the book about my intent?  Does it depend on whether the mechanics punish or reward KKK-like behavior?<br/><br/>I don't have a clear answer.  My position that this sort of game-making doesn't deserve censorship has more to do with my understanding of contemporary American culture than with any ethical absolutes.  If our cultural landscape were flooded with "Let's play Nazis and the Klan!" pastimes, then I would be all in favor of killing that trend, and censorship might be the way to do it.<br/><br/>If someone were to present to me a novel and compelling argument that America <i>is</i> flooded with pastimes that establish positive orientations toward bigotry, then I might change my tune.  I think this is in essence the argument being put forth against various entertainment products -- not that one game over here which might include rape is single-handedly deforming the world, but that it's another drop in an already dangerously-overfull bucket.<br/><br/>I'm going to feel a lot better about my KKK game if I hear that only my diehard liberal friends are playing it than I will if I find it's made it into a bunch of small towns in Missouri which are known for KKK presence.<br/><br/>Anyway, in lieu of a clear answer, three anecdotes:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> I think <a href="https://medium.com/matter/pc-comedy-and-paul-revere-dc2541356851" rel="nofollow">this article on stand-up comedy</a> nails the risks quite well.  Writing and performing a rape joke doesn't make you a rapist, but it doesn't leave you 100% in the clear either.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> Eric Cartman.  Sometimes we're reminded that he acts the way he does because of insecurities and demons and messed-up parenting.  Sometimes being an unrepentant asshole comes back to bite him.  And other times, he's just a blast to watch.  He's the show's most compelling character, conceiving and executing all sorts of entertaining shenanigans, unfettered by morality.  On a show that is definitely not for kids but looks like it would be from the animation style, is Cartman just as corrosive as pro-social children's programming is positive?  Or is he some sort of lesson?<br/><br/><b>3)</b> A friend of mine recently stopped playing Cards Against Humanity because it was seeding his mental experience with awful ideas in a fun context.  Does giggling as we play the "dwarf tossing" card stunt our empathy for little people?  Now that I'm asking that question, and am thinking about the issue, I feel that I can answer "no" on my own behalf.  However, I could just as easily have played the card and never thought about it, and in that case, "yes" is a risk.  <br/><br/>I still enjoy CAH in the right setting, but I do intend to try to <b>insulate myself against callousness-normalization when I play by maintaining a little critical awareness</b>, and I do intend to <b>acknowledge the wrongness when I contribute something wrong to the group</b>.  This is more or less how I view roleplaying slave-owners and KKK members and vampires and the like too.<br/><br/>My friend who's quit CAH and I are more or less on the same page about the dynamics here, and the decision about "not worth it" vs "worth it, if" is pretty fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/OnlyAnAlligator" title="OnlyAnAlligator"><img alt="OnlyAnAlligator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/OnlyAnAlligator">OnlyAnAlligator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456782/#Comment_456782" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-01T20:39:30+00:00" title="October  1, 2016  8:39PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2016 8:42PM by OnlyAnAlligator.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456784/#Comment_456784" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-02T00:26:52+00:00" title="October  2, 2016 12:26AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Jessica Price, sensitive college students, political correctness,<br/><br/>A you trying to make a case that these things are making gaming less political? Because the exact opposite is true. To say that there are right/wrong things for games to portray, or right/wrong ways to portray them is in fact to demand that games adopt a political point of view.<br/><br/>The phenomenon I'm seeing is not an aversion to politics, but an increasingly entrenched political orthodoxy. It's not that games must be apolitical, it's that they must adopt a point of view that affirms the orthodoxy. A vast majority of games published in the "indie" space share a singular political perspective, and those that don't are punished for it. (Cartel, for instance was pretty harshly reviewed in some places for failing to cast strong enough judgement on its subject matter.)<br/><br/>Even Cards Against Humanity does this in a sideways way. The entire premise is that "it's inappropriate to read aloud and laugh at the things on these cards!" By temporarily lifting those taboos, it implicitly affirms the orthodoxy that created them: "Ok, now HERE you can speak this and laugh at this. (Because obviously not out there.)" CAH is a boring waste of time to a person who doesn't observe those taboos.<br/><br/>My impression is that even mass market games are becoming more political, not less. The only design space I see making really apolitical games is the OSR. I sense an attitude there (that I agree with) that there's room in the world for art that portrays human ugliness without judgement. That there's value in sometimes experiencing or examining a thing absent a moral context. That not every piece of media must affirm and instruct goodness. <br/>(Though, obviously, beware the thin line between non-judgement and affirmation.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

reasons you don't agree with</i> and <i>facing persecution and ostracization from your community for not participating</i>. This is a core dynamic behind generational racism/sexism/*ism and I think worth addressing. However, achieving that depends on the players accepting those reasons as wrong <i>at least for the purposes of play</i>, because if they don't the game <i>does</i> become about killing minorities for 'fun'.<br/><br/>Vampire: The Masquerade had exactly this problem. And if you didn't consider your Humanity worth preserving then it became a game about trenchcoats and katanas.<br/><br/>But what can I do to make sure my 'message' gets across besides simply stating my intent? Should I even release such a game if there's a chance an actual racist might play it? Dilemmas like this are why mass media tends to be as politically innocuous as possible. \n<blockquote>A you trying to make a case that these things are making gaming less political?

How can you make a game where it's impossible for the player to reach the 'wrong' conclusions? Because people are not just demanding a single core message, but works which cannot be interpreted in any other way.<br/><br/>The only way I know to accomplish that is to change, expel, silence, or <i>destroy</i> everyone else who thinks differently, which is exactly what dangerous religious radicals do. But how many publishers want to deal with that for just a game?<br/><br/>And so you end up catering to the orthodoxy regardless of whether you actual believe in it or not.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Someone should really write a game about this.\n<blockquote>A vast majority of games published in the "indie" space share a singular political perspective, and those that don't are punished for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The only design space I see making really apolitical games is the OSR.</blockquote>\nI haven't noticed this being more prevalent in the Indie space (Pathfinder is pretty notorious about it), but I have noticed it being <i>less</i> prevalent in the OSR.\n<blockquote>Cartel, for instance was pretty harshly reviewed in some places for failing to cast strong enough judgement on its subject matter.</blockquote>\nR<i>eee</i>aly.<br/><br/>Can you provide sources? Because I'd be very interested in hearing those critiques.<br/><br/>Sadly Mark Diaz Truman is rapidly becoming persona non grata in the Indie community. One of the biggest problems I have with SJWs is how they'll actively <i>destroy</i> someone's beneficial contributions after a single sin and go after people rather than behaviors. For example, Bill Cosby <i>should</i> be condemned for his crimes against women, but his contributions to black performers and stuntmen in particular should not be erased in the process.\n<blockquote>Even Cards Against Humanity does this in a sideways way. The entire premise is that "it's inappropriate to read aloud and laugh at the things on these cards!" <b>By temporarily lifting those taboos, it implicitly affirms the orthodoxy that created them</b>: "Ok, now HERE you can speak this and laugh at this. (Because obviously not out there.)" <b>CAH is a boring waste of time to a person who doesn't observe those taboos</b>.</blockquote>\nI still think a player's relationship with these taboos is important. For example, I derive enjoyment from CAH because it allows me to address the absurdity of the concepts presented. Others play because they enjoy mocking the easily offended. The problem is in play there's absolutely no way to tell the difference between us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456859/#Comment_456859" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-04T18:30:20+00:00" title="October  4, 2016  6:30PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "They'll think you're bad if you portray bad things in a tabletop roleplaying game"<br/>"Who will. please link three"<br/>"Jonathan macintosh"<br/>"This dude is talking about video games and has nothing to say about tabletop roleplaying games, in fact nothing he says is applicable in any way to tabletop roleplaying games"<br/>"tabletop roleplaying games are just video games now anyway due to youtube, anyway what about Jessica Price"<br/>"here is a tweet where she says it's 100 percent okay to portray a kkk member in a roleplaying game, in fact she even says that it's a complex ethical issue! if it was wrong then she would simply say it was wrong"<br/>"this only proves my point!!!!!!!!"<br/><br/>Listen.<br/><br/>The next thing I want from you is the first thing I asked you for.

Both genres make political statements whether or not they intend to.<br/><br/>So unless you can tell us how the differences between them <i>are meaningful in regards to my premise</i> the similarities are such that it applies to both equally.\n<blockquote>here is a tweet where <b>she says it's 100 percent okay to portray a kkk member in a roleplaying game</b>, in fact she even says that it's a complex ethical issue! if it was wrong then she would simply say it was wrong</blockquote>\nBut that's <i>not</i> what she said at all, or to use your own phrasing, if it was 100% OK then she would simply say it was 100% OK.\n<blockquote>If you can't deliver three people who have said that portraying someone evil in a tabletop RPG (like, say, the Empire, in a Star Wars game, an actual genocidal organization) means you are evil, then I just am not going to believe that this is a real trend.</blockquote>\nI'm more than fine with that, in which case perhaps you can go celebrate your internet victory elsewhere?\n<blockquote>Like if someone is sitting at the table stewing with a fake smile on their face thinking "this guy's a fucking idiot" while I blithely ram my face into a wall over and over, what possible benefit is there for them not (eventually) telling me?</blockquote>\nThis is <i>exactly</i> the dynamic I was talking about in my game example, you know, the one <i>where I want to address how people participate in harmful processes because they're afraid to speak up or act against their group</i>. Friends keep quiet about their friend's harmful or stupid behavior all the time for exactly this reason, or do you need links for that too?<br/><br/>The irony, it burns.\n<blockquote>Yes, all these things will also improve people's opinions of me because I won't be throwing out any clumsy shitty "satire" that sucks and is just stupid anymore, it will be top tier stuff.</blockquote>\nOnly if the people you're performing for actually understand and/or appreciate satire. Taking feedback from fools you will only make you foolish.\n<blockquote>You're the one that is saying people will unfairly judge me for promoting racism if I touch on racial issues in a satirical way they don't appreciate even if I'm squarely on point in my own mind.</blockquote>\nYep.\n<blockquote>so how am I ever supposed to get better at satire (to take your example) if nobody ever says "that sucked" when it sucked?</blockquote>\nThat's an excellent question because satire is so context dependent.\n<blockquote>Who is gonna ostracize me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>There's no community to be ostracized <i>from</i>, since liking the same things and buying the same things and even having the same hobby is not a community. </blockquote>\nYet here you are, engaging the community. I also think this debate would be relevant on <a href="https://forum.rpg.net" rel="nofollow">rpg.net</a> and <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/" rel="nofollow">therpgsite.com</a>, but sadly you're banned from both.<br/><br/>And it's great you haven't been banned from your local tabletop groups. I however have not been so fortunate. I've been banned from the group run by the homeless person I allowed to stay at my house (and use my bed (where only later I found out he slept naked *shudder*)), and a Meetup which had no authority to do so when it came to the venue I played at or people I played with.\n<blockquote>Undoubtedly it is because I am so possessive of my own games against the (perceived, clumsy, unwanted) intrusion of the game designer, that I am not really able to put myself in their shoes.</blockquote>\nThen their game design <i>failed</i>, because if the 'intrusion' of the designer does not affect play, then their design has no meaningful impact and is essentially worthless.\n<blockquote>I don't think anyone is upset merely over the possibility that someone might speak unkind words to a participant over their portrayal.  The upsetting possibilities are:<br/><br/>- Someone gets ostracized, hatemail-spammed, or otherwise significantly shit upon for being racist or whatever, when they actually aren't.<br/><br/>- That sort of shit, or the threat thereof, causes smaller designers/publishers to abandon ethically challenging projects.<br/><br/>- Seeing that minefield, larger publishers steer clear and stick to ethically safe projects.</blockquote>\nCan we all at least agree that we <i>don't</i> want to see this happen?\n<blockquote>I know I started this by bringing up Cartel/talking about "the indie space" in broad terms, but the idea of diagraming the relationships of people I don't know squicks me out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I'd be more interested in talking about the attitude itself and what impulses guide it, rather than trying to ascribe it to specific people or communities.</blockquote>\nSame here, and so would I, but it's sometimes impossible to separate the two.\n<blockquote>I think there <i>exists an attitude somewhere</i> that demands art make moral comment on its subject, and that this attitude often correlates to a certain set of liberal political doctrine. The response I remember seeing to Cartel was of people searching for a moral or political message in it, or evaluating it based on its imagined moral outcomes.</blockquote>\nThis is exactly why people were confused about No Country for Old Men. And when it comes to games, I think this philosophy is actively dangerous.\n<blockquote>Feeling an unwelcome impulse to disclaim here that I'm also a strongly liberal person, don't kick me out of the tribe! Is that anxiety of my own creation?</blockquote>\nThe place where this impulse is coming from? <i>That's</i> what I'm concerned about.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457046/#Comment_457046" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T06:19:36+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  6:19AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, I already explained how video games are not the same as tabletop roleplaying games. Video games are mass market broadcasts.  Tabletop roleplaying games are in-person communications.  Even the ones on youtube, the actual players are all directly communicating with each other.  This provides an additional channel to sort these types of issues out that mass media don't have.  <br/><br/>It means you can get people who say "hey dude your satire blows" or "your portrayal of the KKK stinks" and I can get better at satire or the portrayal of racist shitheads.  I described this process above and the only thing you could reply with was "Oh but what if you get BAD FEEDBACKK?!?!?!?!!? WHAT THEN?!?!?!!?"  Oh heavens! That would surely be an insoluble problem.  Surely no other person in any other position in entertainment, business, politics, government, academia or family life has ever gotten bad or useless feedback before.  Whatever will I fucking do if THAT happens!    <br/><br/>You're so freaked out that John Mcintosh, one dude out of the 350 million or so dudes who played online video games last year thinks video games might not be perfect and digital manshooting might have some political problems.   So what? I mean, there's conservative video game players who are like "yeah, you go to Iraq and kill a bunch of Muslim terrorists because of what happened on 9/11 and that's what should be done! Vote Trump, what's your point"? Just look at youtube comments sections or Twitch chats if you don't believe me!  For his critique to mean anything to tabletop roleplaying I have to ignore all feedback and play of the other players at my table.  <br/><br/>Second, you're nuts if you think this is a community. It's an internet forum. rpg.net isn't a community. therpgsite isn't a community.  There may be RPG communities somewhere and you may have a beef with how some of them are run, but there is no community of "RPG players" because just sharing an interest and a thing you bought at the store is not a community.  (Also, GenCon isn't a community because it's controlled entirely by a third party who could simply close down one year for no reason if they wished.) <br/><br/>Finally, to address your first question last: if there are indeed people who believe that I'm evil because I portray the Empire in a Star Wars game, I would like to know about it because maybe they're right. I don't believe they are - in fact, I think it's a pretty silly idea.  But I've been wrong before and some things I've felt were silly turned out to be astute.  So yes, I would like to know if people are saying those things so I could hear them out.<br/><br/>However, the best you can find is one person on Twitter saying "yeah, it is an ethical challenge to portray the KKK in a RPG" and, within the limits of Twitter, that is absolutely true and in no way says that choosing to portray the KKK is unethical, let alone racist!<br/><br/>When I described a vaudeville act in my last Vampire game I said, "Yeah, there's a blackface portion where they do a few songs from Shuffle Along, it absolutely kills, the audience - all white - eats it up.  Two encores, and they only know three songs!"  I COULD have put on some blackface and sang "I'm Just Wild About Harry" myself, if I wished.  It's not illegal!  Lots of people LARP when playing Vampire!  But everyone would rightly see that act in a very different light.  So of course I am thinking about the ethics of my portrayals, just as everyone from Aristotle on has.  It doesn't shock me that there might be an unethical portrayal of the KKK.  Like, of course there might! There's lots of hurtful things you can do at the gaming table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457064/#Comment_457064" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T16:45:05+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  4:45PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>This dude is talking about video games and has nothing to say about tabletop roleplaying games, in fact nothing he says is applicable in any way to tabletop roleplaying games</blockquote>\nBoth genres involve playing from the POV of a single protagonist and present moral dilemmas.</blockquote>\n....do they?<br/><br/>Not to intrude on a perfectly wonderful internet argument, but you two seem to be coming from two entirely different directions on this and never really meeting anywhere. <br/><br/>JDCorley's clearly focused on running/GMing a game (i.e., playing from the POV of the world and presenting multiple antagonists), which -- be honest -- is a situation where portraying terrible people is something that <i>must be done</i> in most genres of games. Good luck playing Star Wars if there's no Empire, right?<br/><br/>You seem to be focused more on the idea of a player portraying a terrible person, which, yeah, that's gonna go wrong a lot, most people being fairly dumb and all, especially if you're in the kind of gaming group where everyone only gets together for a game and never interacts with each other in any other context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457068/#Comment_457068" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T17:00:25+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  5:00PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the supposed critique, (which again, I don't think is actually happening), makes that distinction.

But if I'm reading you correctly, then we'd both say that the problem there isn't portraying a setting where terrible attitudes and behaviors seem to be rewarded, but rather that you need to do a better job of communicating with everyone in the group <i>why</i> the setting is so unjust and that their opinions about it aren't just welcome, but necessary and important. <i>Especially</i> if their opinion is "Cut that shit out, you sound like a jerk and you're ruining what's supposed to be a fun time for me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457081/#Comment_457081" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-13T01:37:35+00:00" title="October 13, 2016  1:37AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My impression is that the critique has never been of <i>the play</i>, but of the text that tell you how to play. <br/><br/>It's not that <i>you shouldn't portray racists</i>, it's that if the text tells you to portray racists, the text should tell you <i>the right way</i> to do so (as villains, for instance.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457082/#Comment_457082" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-13T03:24:57+00:00" title="October 13, 2016  3:24AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 13, 2016 3:25AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think <i>either</i> claim is actually being made anywhere in any significant numbers.

You have to represent each culture in an identifiable manner somehow, even if just from the character's PoV, and simply stating your intent isn't enough as 'intent doesn't matter'. And if there isn't a way, does that mean you cannot address issues of racism in an RPG without <i>appearing</i> to be a racist or evangelizing a specific point of view?<br/><br/>Because games are a <i>model</i>, not a <i>moral statement</i>, and the latter is a product of the player's <i>choices</i>, not the game setting. But many believe in a world where morals <i>are</i> the model, and I'm not sure how to get around that, if it's possible at all.\n<blockquote>First, I already explained how video games are not the same as tabletop roleplaying games.

Computing has an entire field devoted to error correction to validate feedback.

You gave me a video game guy, a total  nobody as far as I can tell - he was obliquely involved with literally one set of youtube videos - saying something a giant video game company did might be wrong, and Jessica Price saying portraying the KKK in a RPG might be tough.  Video games don't matter to this discussion because what we do is extremely different for numerous obvious reasons.

They can't sit next to you while you play the video game they made and say "Oh crap, that's not what I meant for you to take away from this, let's pause here while I fix this," then reprogram the rest of the game while you go get a sandwich. Yeah, a video game is more interactive than a movie, but it's still just a container full of pre-written material, not an actual direct interaction between one person and another.<br/><br/>A tabletop roleplaying game session, on the other hand, isn't a mass market experience. Everyone involved in it is right there, they know each other (even if only in a "you are sitting in that chair three feet away from me" sense), and crucially, they can communicate directly with each other and change what they are doing while they are doing it.<br/><br/>That seems very relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_457131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457131/#Comment_457131" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-16T03:01:56+00:00" title="October 16, 2016  3:01AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Until I see what I asked for, 3 people who said that portraying something evil or racist in a RPG means you are evil or racist, I am indeed done.</blockquote>\nAnd yet here you <i>still</i> are.

Following your links, I have now read up on the issue, and there's way too much of that going on, from all sides.  Fanaticism begets fanaticism, I guess.<br/><br/>Hopefully Avery can find a way to avoid both the reactionary bandwagon and the harassment-enabling.  <br/><br/>Personally, I don't think working with someone who did a bad thing necessarily supports the thing they did, and I'd be happy to clarify the difference for anyone who cared.  <br/><br/>"This guy claiming to stand up for Jews who spent much of his post saying how we need to treat Hitler better?  Yeah, I think that was fucking awful.  He doesn't seem to have learned his lesson either.  It disgusts and angers me.  So, what to do?  Well, he has done <i>other</i> good things for Jews, and he clearly <i>wants</i> to be helpful, so I'm gonna hope he eventually comes around, and do what I can in that direction.  In the meantime, it doesn't do anyone any good if he simply disappears from the sphere wherein he's done a lot of good and a little bad, so if I'm working on a project for which I'd normally invite him, I still will.  If anyone mistakes that as an <i>endorsement</i> of his Hitler post, please read this paragraph.  Good people do bad things sometimes.

The first twenty replies: 17 expressing support for Avery and/or her decision, 2 retracting support for the project, and 1 saying he disagreed with the decision but would back the project anyway.<br/><br/>Avery said that after her initial comment on the issue, she "watched as my Kickstarter numbers ticked up, down, up, down, up for several days."<br/><br/>Some of this is heartening, but some of it is unnerving too.  I guess if an indie RPG is gonna get hundreds or thousands of backers, a lot of those people are going to be fairly plugged into who's who and what's what and the latest news.  This is quite alien to me.  I'd like to be able to find an audience without entering the land of community drama, but perhaps that's not how this works.<br/><br/>I really hope the number of backers Avery lost over this issue is small.  Maybe it's just two people, and the up-down numbers just coincided with the "middle of the pledge window" lull many games experience.  Or, maybe it's two in <i>every</i> twenty, and she's lost 150 backers.  That would be pretty messed up, that Avery loses 150 backers because Mark and Marissa decided to play moral police on Rob and then the rest of the internet decided to play moral police on Mark.  That sort of reactionary army may bode ill for the stability of future projects, creators and companies.<br/><br/>Or not.  Bluebeard is approaching $100k.<br/><br/>I dunno.<br/><br/>I hope Rob's projects aren't impacted.  That's actually the scariest part of this whole saga to me, that I might say something mean to a vicious Facebook troll and then get publicly called out and dropped by some crusader who thinks I'm a poor representative of Story Gaming or something.  Yikes.<br/><br/>Maybe we can disagree with each other <i>without</i> wielding the ostracism stick?  That one guy who disagrees with Avery but isn't pulling out is my hero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_458094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458094/#Comment_458094" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-15T02:24:09+00:00" title="November 15, 2016  2:24AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark's also involved in the most successful RPG Kickstarter of all time (7th Sea), which is the point: These kinds of boycotts <i>disproportionately hurt the most vulnerable minorities</i>.<br/><br/>And those who pulled their pledge made it quite clear they consider it more important to <i>not</i> support Mark in this trivial manner than support Avery and minorities like her in far more important ways, <i>still</i> support Mark by using Kickstarter in the first place, and are likely members of those very minority groups themselves, which is bullshit on a level beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>Yet Avery <i>still</i> approached them with genuine concern and compassion at the cost of her own emotional well being because she actually gives a damn, which is why she can mix politics and gaming so effectively. So losing just <i>one</i> backer over this hurts because it's not 'about' the money, and I wouldn't be surprised if she still feels as if she failed those people in some way.<br/><br/>Me? I've been the target and collateral of this kind of emotional blackmail once too often, and spending 90% of your emotional energy on 10% of your supporters is just not practical in the long run. And when people make things more difficult for the ones I care about, even if out of pain, even if <i>unintentionally</i>, I'm going to hold them at least as accountable as they hold others for the same.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20747/dumb-fun" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20747/dumb-fun" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20747/dumb-fun/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20747%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20747%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
