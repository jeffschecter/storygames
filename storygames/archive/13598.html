I played with my two flatmates, Ulric and J\xe9r\xe9mie. The former had never played RPGs before, the second had only played a few trad games. I thought InSpectres would be the best choice, with very simple mechanics and an open-ended story. Comedic and low-pressure.<br/><br/>But it had mixed results. Most of the story was built by me (when they failed) and J\xe9r\xe9mie (when he succeeded), with Ulric not doing much. J\xe9r\xe9mie seemed mostly worried about trying to tie out loose ends as they would happen to the point of missing out on nice story opportunities (e.g. they failed a roll and I declared them lost in the country, but he used the confessional to just cancel it, I don't remember how, exactly).<br/><br/>We still had some measure of fun. I was satisfied that I had not turned them off RPGs forever at the very least. We pretty much agreed all that was lacking was experience.<br/><br/>I talked with them both separately. They were able to articulate what they wished for in a game.<br/><br/>J\xe9r\xe9mie liked zany, nonsensical adventures, apparently. He was eying Capes, one of my favorite games.<br/><br/>Ulric said the most important thing was consistency and continuity.<br/><br/>Hum.<br/><br/>We also invited Chanel, a friend who was in Ulric and I's theatre class.<br/><br/>Again, not a success, but not a failure either. I wanted to play a GMless game because I wanted to be able to lead by example. Ulric and J\xe9r\xe9mie both had more fun, and were able to give better performance than with InSpectres, but Chanel wasn't thrilled buy the premise. My theory was that this was something new for all of them, so  I'd keep things light and keep drama to a minimum (which is what J\xe9r\xe9mie prefers anyway). But Chanel completely failed to find my supervillain trying to rob a bank to be very engaging. Eventually, I set up a conflict goal between her and another player, I think that triggered her interest better, but I now take note:<br/><br/>Chanel wants to build a meaningful stories. Which is fine by me, I prefer it that way.<br/><br/>Another potential player is Daniel, who is very nice, but he can't concentrate.<br/><br/>So now I have been thinking throughout the Holidays, what would be a good game to try next. <br/><br/>Maybe I should try one of those two games again, now that they're more familiar with the mechanics. I know these games can lead to meaningful, coherent, consistent stories. But I prefer to try something else. I want something that'll click for them, and then I'll go back. Someday.<br/><br/>I have been thinking of using :<br/><br/>-Shock: Each player will control an issue and tackle another one with their protagonist. It's bound to be meaningful.<br/><br/>-1001 Nights : we're theatre enthusiasts and we like storytellers and storytelling. I would definitely see us dress up for this. There would be stories within a story, which would cater to each individuals taste... I think. That's the one game I haven't tried, though.<br/><br/>-Dirty Secrets : I'm mostly thinking of keeping this game for later. It's weird inversed structure (one investigator, rotating  authority duties) would make it hard, I think, on the player being the Investigator. At the same time, we play Perudo all the time in this appartment. It's Ulric's favorite game.<br/><br/>Hero's Banner : Up there mostly because it's one of my favorite games, it never failed me, and the subject matter, I think, can only be relevant to a group of twenty-somethings.<br/><br/>Ulric has found Diplomacy used for 2$. Genius. I have never played, but have been reading up on it in the past week. We're going to play that first. I can't wait. And then I'll set up a new date for a RPG. <br/><br/>Comments?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307397/#Comment_307397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T21:27:04+00:00" title="January  7, 2011  9:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My suggestion is that you introduce Daniel to Capes, or Chanel and Daniel to InSpectres. With folks who aren't avid gamers, it seems pretty common that they would rather take a while familiarizing themselves with a game, rather than be excited about learning a new one each time they play.<br/><br/>My experience with indie rpg folks is that we all are more interested in trying new games all the time, because we tend to have a wish list of games we want to play, and with limited schedules, we want to fit in what we can. That's why my group and I are like, at any rate. <br/><br/>My girlfriend is the complete opposite - she tried Fiasco once, and that seems to be *the* rpg she'd be interested in trying again in the future, and she works the same way with board games. I don't, but I'm warming to more consistency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_307402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307402/#Comment_307402" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T02:31:16+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  2:31AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>Ulric has found Diplomacy used for 2$.

Or; if you have a feeling about what they would really like by now, you could go on to something you know will deliver it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307735/#Comment_307735" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T20:38:24+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  8:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, we don't expect a shortage of players for Diplomacy. RPGs are new for my friends, but we still play boardgames pretty often. (Actually, mostly Carcassonne and Perudo).<br/><br/>Similarly, though I've so far played with Ulric, Chanel and J\xe9r\xe9mie, they and Daniel aren't the only people I expect to play with. <br/><br/>You guys have a point about sticking to a ruleset they've tried. But Chanel didn't like Capes. She had a hard time grasping the rules, and she struggled with the English on the Clicks and Locks (we play in French). Ulric didn't like InSpectres, it was too vagues for his tastes,and too rooted in the supernatural.<br/><br/>I had a chat with Ulric, and described the games I mentionned in the OP. He was pretty enthusiastic about Dirty Secrets and 1001 Nights. And was reasonably interested in Hero's Banner, which I'll probably keep for later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
