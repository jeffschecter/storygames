While it's called Free RPG Day, there is money involved. First from the publishers to make the product and then from the Retailers to sign up to get the kit boxes (Which pays for the shipping, handling, labour Impressions incur). if we assume that there are indie writers/publishers willing, I wondered about the motivation for retailers to buy the kit if it had indie games in it and - more widely - what their motivation was for stocking indie rpgs in the first place.<br/><br/>In a market environment where the internet is killing off even apex predator high-street bookstore chains, I can understand a brick'n'mortar retailer being a bit down on the entire pen'n'paper rpg hobby as a whole. What is their edge? What can they provide that will encourage a discerning, money-constrained gamer to buy an rpg from them instead of ordering online? Maybe they should focus on miniatures and wargaming where the profit margins are higher, online purchasing is less common and where they have a greater edge in servicing a local community.<br/><br/>I think that indie rpgs do have a few advantages that could be leveraged, but perhaps the potential consumer base out there is simply too small to matter.<br/><br/>Does anyone have a local store (or even know of a store) where the retailer actually makes a commercial go of indie rpgs instead of ignoring them completely or having them in some back room as an afterthought? If so, how have they done it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382700/#Comment_382700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T16:00:25+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  4:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2012 4:00PM by Rafael.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been working with a handful of local gaming stores (Foundation's Edge, Hobby Masters, All Fun &amp; Games) for about ten years now. Foundation's Edge, a few other places. Since I haven't released a new game in three years, I haven't replenished the stock lately, but I'll probably start back up again later this year.<br/><br/>Aha! Took me a couple minutes to find this, but -- here's what I posted in another thread about 4 years ago:<br/><br/>"The first edition of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium was released in 2002, before the advent of Lulu. I had 100 copies printed up for about fifteen dollars a book. I'd sell them to the store for $20 apiece, and the store owner would sell them for $30. It usually sold out pretty quickly. I only sold a few copies this way -- most of my sales were direct, where people would paypal me and I'd put the book in a padded envelope and mail it to them.<br/><br/>These days, I print Dread up at Lulu for about 11 bucks. Add a few dollars for shipping, so that's, say, fourteen dollars a book. I take it to game store X, where they buy a copy from me for $20. They sell it for cover price -- $25 -- and so I make six dollars, store guy makes five. Sell enough copies, it adds up enough to justify the time and energy. Again, however, this only accounts for a small percentage of my sales -- most of my sales are online, via Lulu.<br/><br/>My sales pitch is pretty straightforward. I give the store guy a copy of my book, along with a one-page information doc. It lists the name of the book, and a one-paragraph summary (no jargon, you story/indie people -- just give them the plain-English version of what the game's setting and mechanics are like). Under that, a bulleted list of features (presumably, the same ones you've got on your web site).<br/><br/>The rest of the page consists of quotes from reviews, with proper citation (name of reviewer, name of site/publication, date). At the bottom, my URL in big bold letters.<br/><br/>This approach, combined with a direct and friendly sales pitch (when the store is pretty much empty and the store owner can give me her/his undivided attention), tends to seal the deal. Since this is the second time I'm doing this, I can draw on sales figures from the first edition of Dread to support my assertion that the game will, in fact, sell."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382701/#Comment_382701" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T16:02:54+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  4:02PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2012 4:18PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My <a href="http://sourcecandg.com/" rel="nofollow">local store</a> has a bunch of indie games.

The "new in store" shelf has Microscope and Monsterhearts on it this week and there've been copies of AW and Burning Wheel and Sorceror around and in-stock as long as I can remember.  They bought in to the Dungeon World kickstarter at the merchant level, too, and have asked me to run demos.  I know Joe's had some positive support from there, too.<br/><br/>So, I guess, anecdotal-evidence-wise, it is possible to make indie game sales happen at a store level, so long as the employees actually care about them.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382711/#Comment_382711" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T16:49:17+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  4:49PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2012 6:01PM by Andy.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game Kastle in Santa Clara, CA carries a decent selection of indie RPGs, and the owner in fact went out of his way to order Maid RPG from us. I suspect it's right at a point where they're not losing money on indie games, but these games are for the most part small enough that it's more out of a desire to better serve the local gaming community. If they only cared about money, they'd scarcely bother with RPGs, or at least with RPGs that aren't D&amp;D and Pathfinder (a kind of D&amp;D), and we already have one or two other CCG-only game stores in the area.<br/><br/>While we can and do reach a lot of people via the internet, there's still a large pool of potential customers who either don't bother to look deeper into RPGs online, or who do but won't have happened across any given game. An FLGS can put indie games in front of people who might never have come in contact with them. There's a limit to how much more they can do when they have a store full of other, better-selling products to deal with, but the better local game stores can be all kinds of awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marqos" title="marqos"><img alt="marqos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/850/nXOPCJBZCOJ7Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marqos">marqos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382716/#Comment_382716" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T17:33:50+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  5:33PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out here in Olympia, (where Realities were most recently Fabricated) our FLGSs are pretty dang supportive. <a href="http://www.olympiccardsandcomics.com/" rel="nofollow">Olympic Cards and Comics</a> (which might just be the best and most expansive nerd-store in North America, seriously) has a nicely stuffed indie/small press section with all the "big" titles in stock and many, many more "obscure" titles there as well.

They don't really have much of a clue how to order the right stuff, fulfill the needs of their customers, and make money. These guys sometimes carry indie games, but they often stay on the shelves and don't get purchased or played often. They are hard to work with because, even if you tell them about new games you want to buy or run in the store, they often won't order them or help support you. They survive most by selling minis, Magic, and D&amp;D/Pathfinder and the rest is too much work to keep track of.<br/><br/>2.

I think part of what makes indie games a little more difficult to sell is the unreasonable stigma associated with playing rpgs differently then you are used to.

It's still easier to duck into a store and buy three d12s and two d4s than it is to go online and order 'em. (But that's a lousy business model, I guess.)<br/><br/>And I suppose it can offer some kind of real-world social hub to meet and hang out with other gamers, assuming first that you are someone who enjoys that sort of thing, and second, that there are enough other people who enjoy that sort of thing near that brick-and-mortar store to make it worth your time to hang out there. But that's mostly a guess, because I definitely do not qualify on the first half of that at all. Do "gaming community" people still hang out in gaming stores, or have you all moved on to Facebook or something?<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I thought I read somewhere that Magic: the Gathering cards were basically the thing that kept brick-and-mortar gaming stores in business. If that's true, then I'd think the place for any RPGs (indie or otherwise) would be "shelved wherever we can't put the M:tG cards and where it won't get in the way of people buying M:tG stuff."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/silby" title="silby"><img alt="silby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/silby">silby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382772/#Comment_382772" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T00:19:35+00:00" title="June 19, 2012 12:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magic stuff is always behind the counter though, presumably to prevent shrink.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382799/#Comment_382799" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T05:34:18+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  5:34AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually have these crazy ideas but I've always wanted a game store that also served food and drinks.

If your staff know Pathfinder and are good at advising and selling Pathfinder then you're going to be able to increase the Pathfinder footprint in your area. But you're also going to become more dependent on that one range and their big releases for your revenues (as GW stores are).  <br/><br/>Also, when your customers are focused on a single publisher's product line then they will naturally start getting their news from the publisher's website and the publisher in turn will try to leverage that to start selling to customers direct at a higher margin.\n<blockquote>Another thing a store could do is have a printer/bookbinder machine in the store and charge for it's use.</blockquote>\nThis is certainly the future (assuming the dead tree format doesn't disappear entirely) as POD machines get smaller and cheaper. You'll be able to walk into a store and walk out with any book from a selection of millions. Such technology will certainly lend itself to the simpler production values of indie rpgs over mainstream.\n<blockquote>The only thing that a brick and mortar store provides over online ordering is the ability to browse (a shitload of online ordering offers this now too, in slightly truncated form) and an expert staff to help you find a game you will love. Unless the staff is willing to play lots of RPGs, they won't be able to help people find a niche RPG when they might like one. Staff at gaming stores, like RPG gamers in general, probably play D&amp;D, and that's what they have expertise in and can direct people to when they will like D&amp;D. </blockquote>\nI certainly agree with your first point - that an edge retailers have is to advise customers and allow them to browse (I'm sure there's psychology research that's been done on how much more likely someone is to buy something if they're physically holding it). <br/><br/>Having your staff able to talk knowledgeably about D&amp;D is great if you're a D&amp;D store - but not much good if you're trying to shift any other kind of inventory.<br/><br/>I think of quality bookstores - no one expects the staff to read every single new book they put on the shelves - but you expect them to have a sufficient knowledge to advise customers even towards books they haven't read based on the genre, the author, formal reviews or what colleagues have said.<br/><br/>It strikes me though that the product offering of mainstream RPGs is quite unusual. There's a core game book (Which has to be priced at a reasonable level to get people to invest) and then a series of optional supplements that look to enrich the experience (but can't be used on their own) where they try to make the profit.  <br/><br/>Is that a common model? Tabletop wargames certainly, but their supplements (particularly miniatures) aren't really considered optional. Video games have used it, but my impression is (for the world outside Steam at least) the number of expansion packs with "This requires XXXX game to play" on the back has gone down as video game publishers decide to spend a few more dollars to make a full game for which they can charge a higher price.<br/><br/>(A couple of obvious exceptions to this spring to mind: World of Warcraft - which is a video mainstream rpg in any case - and The Sims - which is clearly based on a Nordic freeform larp.)<br/><br/><br/>Whereas the indie rpg product is a far more similar to most other products. It's self-contained and expected to be used without (the publisher doesn't bank on) any supplements. In this way it's like a book or a magazine or a movie or a toy or a mainstream game like Monopoly or music or any one of a number of other sources of entertainment. In the case of mainstream toys, supplements might exist (extra lego sets for example) but they also stand alone. I don't need a core lego set to get started.<br/><br/>In all these fields, there are some recognised classics that are held in stock, but aside from those there is a high churn of the 'new'. The 'new' book/movie/toy/CD comes in, sells what it does and then the remainder returned, discounted or destroyed to clear shelf space for the new 'new'.<br/><br/>Coupled with this is the ease of accessibility - the 'new' has to be easily accessible. There are few books (and there are a few) where you have to sit down for a couple of hours beforehand to work out how you're going to enjoy it.<br/><br/>And there are no platform issues. When a new book or movie comes in, it's of potential interest to anyone because it's not dependent on having a specific preceding purchase to enjoy it (unlike a gaming supplement which is almost always limited to a total potential population of the people who bought the core book). Sure, customers have preferences, but that's not a concrete barrier to potentially enjoying the product.<br/><br/>I realise that not all indie games are easily accessible, but - to talk in gross generalisations - they often have a simpler total ruleset than a mainstream rpg. And, amongst indie players, there is a greater emphasis on the 'new' - what is the 'hot, new game of the moment?' And there are no platform issues. While indie players will have their preferences - none of them will ever immediately blank a product because it's not for _their_ system.<br/><br/>And given the variety of indie games available, the advantages that stores provide - allowing people to browse and sample and guiding them with informed advice - are that much more important for indie gamers than for a mainstream player dedicated to a system.<br/><br/><br/>I think I've run away too far with the idea here. I'm ignoring the many flaws of indie rpgs as a commercial venture - not the least of which is that you can't plan a business unless you know in well advance what releases are happening when - which doesn't fit in with most indie rpg creation.<br/><br/>Certainly the traditional retailer method of supporting of demoing and then holding leagues or tournaments wouldn't work (or wouldn't be nearly as cost-effective) for indie rpgs.<br/><br/>While I've likened indie rpgs to books and movies the one distinct difference is that I don't need anyone else to help me read a book or watch a movie. I can enjoy it completely without worrying about the choices of others. More commercially, the 'sale or return' approach in book selling removes from the retailer a huge risk out of the churn of the 'new' and disposal of the old 'new'.<br/><br/>Mainstream games like Monopoly do require other players - but I don't know anything about their operating model works. Mainstream game stores seem stuffed to the gills with 'the classics' or skinlifts of classics with very little 'new' coming through.<br/><br/>Still, it is good to hear so many stories of retailers willing to put effort into achieving a critical mass of indie games that can impact local playing habits as part of a RPG product range. <br/><br/><i>Edited for sanity</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382882/#Comment_382882" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T10:43:53+00:00" title="June 20, 2012 10:43AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have literally an entire PowerPoint presentation I give to other retailers at trade shows on this very subject.

I think that's the single best thing keeping <i>any</i> FLGS open, these days (it also helps that they seem to manage, like, ever single comic collector's monthly buys, in the area).<br/><br/>The fact that Sci Fi Genre can stock indie/local games (with their typically smaller margins-per-shelf-inch) is largely based on them making a solid income online.<br/><br/>Contrast that with... ANOTHER store in the area... whose owner seemed actively hostile to my trying to run an "indie games meetup" every week or two. The reason? He has no online presence (barely an informational site; no online store), minimal gaming space, and wouldn't stock indies because of those lower margins-per-shelf-inch. Apparently, all the Pathfinder and Magic players were spending money on a regular basis; but "indie gamers" could play for months and even YEARS with (*gasp!*) a free PDF, or some $20 Lulu book. (I made a point of spending at least $5 - $10 a week, but I was one of the few in the "meetup" who did consistently.)<br/><br/>==========<br/>So there's two data points, representing 100% of my current experience with FLGSs. Success breeds largess; and indies need largess; or need to work better retailer margins; or need to switch to retail-only sales, to avoid competing with folks willing to pickup their products.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382928/#Comment_382928" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T19:20:28+00:00" title="June 20, 2012  7:20PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My local game store has lots of indie stuff in stock, and hosts a monthly GoD thing.

Carrying a decent selection makes it clear we know RPGs and follow RPG design and culture, especially because we educate staff to have a working knowledge of the best of them, and support them with in-store play.<br/><br/>For neophytes, we've found at our shop that they have the same impact there as you guys have raved about at PAX: to a new gamer, they've maybe heard of D&amp;D, but everything else is brand-new to them, and it's a lot easier to sell a high-concept $25 story game than a $60 hardcover with half a shelf of supplements to someone new to (but interested in) the hobby. And once they've played one, they tend to come back for others, engaging with them more like board games or console games than the old-school 'supplement treadmill' consumption model. That they tend to be easier to pick up and run on short notice makes them ideal for in-store play and convention gaming, both of which we try hard to support.<br/><br/>Evan said this: "it's now local advocacy on the level of conventions (GoD) and retailers (FLGS) that will entrench the indie culture across the USA."<br/><br/>I believe this to be the case strongly enough that I coach other retailers with basically this advice. If local game shops are to remain relevant and profitable, they need to really ramp up their community-building efforts, and RPGs are a great way to do that. The necessity of seeking out unique merchandise that hasn't been commodified by Amazon and/or big boxes makes the Indie RPG movement a really good fit.<br/><br/>As designers, if you care at all about supporting these efforts, here's the best way to go about it:<br/><br/>When you do Kickstarters, make a Retailer Reward level available: 4-6 copies of your game  including shipping for 50% off cover. No bells, no whistles, no special perks needed (though we'll happily take them). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MEDIA MAIL shipping is totally fine!</span> They just need to get to us in one piece, and we're not expecting them next day.<br/><br/>No matter who you are or how you're distributing, if you give PDFs to customers how mail order your books, it'd be really cool of you to allow us to distribute those to our customers as well. Whether it's participating in Bits n' Mortar, trusting us to just be cool about giving them out on the honor system, or having us e-mail you when we sell a copy so you can send 'em yourself (Hi, Vincent!).<br/><br/>Make a moderately easy way to order your books when we sell out. If you're not in regular distribution (and most of you aren't!), consider IPR, most of us use them! If that's not feasible, for whatever reason, then a quick bit on your web site about how to order direct is fine. As with Kickstarters, we'll probably be OK with ordering a minimum QTY (4-6), but we need to get them for 50% off including shipping to make it worth shelf-stocking them. I know that really chops margin off for some of you, but please at least consider putting out a call when you do a print run when padding it doesn't cost you expected margin, or just build a certain percentage of retailer sales into your budgeting.<br/><br/>Mostly, feel free to go into local game stores and talk to the owners, or get to know some of the Indie-friendly retailers who attend larger shows you might go to as well. Most of us are happy to talk about our business models and how you might be bale to help us sell games. The growth of gourmet and long-tail retailing is very much a reality everywhere, and extra legwork to find unique and cutting-edge games is something many progressive retailers have come to realize is part of the new normal. Have a policy in place so that you know how to respond when a store owner asks you about how to carry your game, make sure anyone else who helps you sell at Cons knows it too, and be ready to let an interested retailer who meets you at a regional show snag 4 copies of your game at wholesale right there for his store. (Oh, and have a Square account and a reader so they can just hand you their store credit card).<br/><br/>All of this is practical stuff, but I hope it helps. I have mentioned our retailer-friendly Kickstarter list, I am an active participant there, feel free to drop notes to modern.myths.ny atsign gmail and I will pass them along. Just since Origins, I have signal-boosted Dungeon World, Durance, Serpent's Tooth, and had half a dozen more come my way via other retailers. We use the list, and I think it has an impact on the back end, so please design retailer rewards along the lines I mentioned above and let me know about them!<br/><br/>And, for anyone who actually WANTS to read my PowerPoint presentation to other interested retailers on boosting their RPG sales through indie games and robust events, <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/75441825/RPG%20Seminar.ppt" rel="nofollow">here's the link</a>. I'd ask you to please not share that outside the site here, I am still actively presenting it at retailer gatherings, but since some people asked, I figured I could share it here. (Note: You can read my actual Seminar text in the 'notes' field of each slide.)<br/><br/>Please feel free to hit me with Whispers if you have any other questions, or poet them up here if you think the answers would help others.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384198">\n<div

Really, MtG and (certain) minis games are good examples of how the equivalent of The Supplement Treadmill can work. Stir in competitiveness (both in and out of game with) aspects of gambling with no small amount of Lonely Fun potential and a much different schedule for meeting to game and group composition for gaming, and you start hitting a whole lot of differentiating factors that those games have not generally nearly as present in RPGs.<br/><br/>(* There are a whole lot of minis games that don't fit into the playstyle and promotional style of the sort pioneered successfully by Games Workshop and followed up by other companies like the folks who created Flames of War and The Warmachines/Hordes and similar. I suspect their sales and community building is much closer to what you see for RPGs, indie or otherwise.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384229/#Comment_384229" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T13:34:34+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  1:34PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *applause for Jim*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384243/#Comment_384243" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T14:30:10+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  2:30PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key to this is the same as PAX; you quickly realize you can sell a lot more RPGs to people who don't already play them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp" title="BRennekamp"><img alt="BRennekamp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BRennekamp">BRennekamp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384250/#Comment_384250" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T15:45:12+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  3:45PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2012 3:46PM by BRennekamp.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>MtG and ( certain*) minis games have some things going for them that generally RPGs ( of any sort ) don't, and that certainly helps.

Undoubtedly one of the reasons for oWoD's monetary success was cheap splatbooks. At around 40% of the cost of a hardcover core rulebook, you got all kinds of goodies for your character ( and maybe some in-game advantages from simple extra knowledge gleaned from the book) at a price that fit into the impulse purchase range for many people.<br/><br/>Even a minis-use encouraging RPG like D&amp;D 4e never did a good job of encouraging non-GM players to buy minis. Even the rather pricey ( if lovely) Reaper minis you commonly find in game shops fit into an impulse purchase price range, there's just no particular reason to buy them if you aren't a GM. And if you are a GM, something like D&amp;D would break most folks' gaming budgets if they actually tried to keep up with all possible critter threats, in their expected appearing per encounter numbers, if you tried to go for minis.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384260/#Comment_384260" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T17:19:55+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  5:19PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My quick take as a consumer in the East Bay area. Of the four gaming stores that are close to me (yes, I'm lucky), <br/><br/>-Endgame has the best layout for indie games and staff and play area and is just plain fun to go to. <br/>-Games of Berkeley has a really deep selection of indie games and a lot of the older ones. They always seem to have Luke and Vincent's games available. <br/>-Dr. Comics and Mr. Games has the least amount of RPGs and usually has a copy of Burning Wheel Gold floating around. <br/>-It's Your Move Games has a kind staff and a bit more RPGs. I've seen copies of The Dresden Files there. <br/><br/>I like all the shops for different reasons, but if I want to browse and flip through the newest in indie games (the reason for me to go to the brick and mortar, oh and instant gratification of course) I'll go to EndGame or Games of Berkeley. EndGame takes the edge as far as service, though. <br/><br/>When I lived in Portland, I remember Guardian Games being really cool, although looking through the RPGs felt like diving through a used bookshop. This can be a fun thing, but not if you're looking for the newest and shiniest, which I usually am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384389/#Comment_384389" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T20:42:07+00:00" title="July  5, 2012  8:42PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2012 8:48PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot for posting and sharing, Jim. I was particularly interested to read that you might look to interest a new gamer in a story game rather than a mainstream hardcover. New recruits are the lifeblood of turnover - especially as veterans have greater knowledge of alternative direct sales channels.<br/><br/>Indie games also spread across far more genres than mainstream can and thereby catch the attention of potential new recruits uninterested in traditional rpg settings. (This much I can glean from the reaction of my wife to Monsterhearts and Shooting the Moon.)<br/><br/>I'm particularly pleased that they've engaged with them like board games/console games/novels. It strikes me that it plays more into a retailer's strength to have this kind of customer behaviour than to have customers who are wedded to a single system. In the former case, the gamer needs personal, informed advice to navigate the myriad different games out there to find the ones right for them - and is potentially open to anything, whereas in the latter the 'value-add' provided by the retailer can be reduced to letting them know when the next release for that one particular system is coming out.<br/><br/>David Artman above relates a retailer saying that indie gamers can play for years with a free PDF. While possible, that doesn't square with my own (limited) experience. While mainstream players can get years of entertainment from one player with the core books, from what I've seen indie players churn through games at a far quicker rate. Indie games don't typically try to offer a holistic gaming experience, they focus on one thing and try to do that. The hot new game that everyone's playing stays that for a couple of months until the next one comes out, when it's shelved until the player gets the itch for that kind of experience again or thinks of a way to adapt it so to get a different experience. It can be a downer for the designer, but this constant interest in the 'new' is better for a retailer.<br/><br/><br/>I was wondering, in addition to your advice as to how designers can help retailers:<br/><br/>1) Knowing about it in the first place<br/>Talking briefly to my UK FLGS (who has a great display of indies), he said that there were a couple of difficulties with them. The first was hearing about them in the first place. While committed retailers will have their ear to the ground, it's in the designers best interest to inform them of a new product by the means that the retailer wants. How do you want to be told of new product/release date/etc - emails from individual designer/publishers? through a centralised source? <br/><br/>2) Ordering the product<br/>The second difficulty he mentioned was in ordering. Especially for indie games he wants small quantities of a wide variety and the time it takes for him to order 2 or 3 copies from a dozen different designer/publishers is time he could spend selling. You've mentioned IPR and Kickstarter, is there anything else?<br/><br/>3) Demonstrating the product<br/>As you say, it should also be quicker and easier to 'get somewhere' in a demonstration of a story game than in a crunchier mainstream game. Mainstream publishers spend money designing demo/introductory scenes and training staff to run demos to engage browsing customers quickly. Would it be genuinely useful for a story game to come with guidance as to how to demonstrate it in-store in 10 minutes - or would this be something that would be largely wasted effort as in-store demos aren't an effective use of time or you have your own clear ideas of how best to demo a game?<br/><br/>4) The Visuals<br/>Sales, especially sales to newcomers, are driven by visuals. A war-game set up on terrain with painted miniatures has a huge advantage in catching a new customer's attention than one that's boxed. With fiction books, customers can flip through them to sample the experience and try before they buy. RPGs, however, are typically bagged and so rely on the cover as the only visual info.<br/><br/>Related to this, during demonstrations or if you host meetups or allow gaming, when you look around at groups playing different story games, many look the same. Unless one of them has the rulebook in front of them, there's often very little to distinguish visually one game in progress from another. Not every game has to be as visually elaborate as Mouse Guard, but even the simple visual elements in games like Fiasco and Microscope help serve as an 'eye-pop' that can engage a new customer's interest.<br/><br/>Would you find it useful if more story games included a visual aspect beyond rulebook and character sheets - or again would you think that any special effort put into this by the designer would be wasted because it's better/more efficient to sell a story game on an elevator pitch and cover?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384411/#Comment_384411" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-06T02:04:18+00:00" title="July  6, 2012  2:04AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As it happens, I am at DexCon trying to put all my bloviating into practice!
