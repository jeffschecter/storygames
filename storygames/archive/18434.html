I wanted a skin that used a move like that to bring dark secrets into play. Another goal was to provide a possible model for the succubi in the shows Lost Girl and The Gates. The project began as a desire for a more dominant alternative to The Succubus. Of course Incubi can be boys or girls, just like succubi. Ignoring real-world lore, we're just calling this one The Incubus to distinguish it.<br/><br/>Playing an Incubus is not necessarily about being a sociopath. The horror of killing lovers may drive a sensitive soul to abstinence or other sorts of penitent behavior. If the sex move seems complex, that is by design, as that is the core move of the skin. <br/><br/>We've tested the skin twice now and it worked well, tending toward more villainy, as befits a demon.<br/><br/>All comments will be carefully considered.

That is juicy stuff there. <br/><br/>I feel like if I played the Incubus, I might try to abuse Dark Wings and the Power of Summoning. Between the two of them, I can practically take scene framing away from the MC. If Dark Wings can be used when I'm not in the scene, then I can be in just about every scene as long as I have strings (and a Hot little <i>cube</i> like me will have all the strings). This isn't a problem for me. I will be great playing my character and framing all the scenes around my character. It might be a problem for others though. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I really like how the Power of Summoning can be given to someone else. Now I wish I could trade other demonic powers... like in a pact. <br/><br/>In the sex move, you say "activate two Demonic Powers instead of one". Do you mean infuse two powers?<br/><br/>I could also use a little help in explaining what happens with the Soul Leech move. You have some text in "Playing", but for some reason it's still not perfectly clear to me. Is the idea that, since a PC always has a choice to kiss the succubus, they are "allowing" their character's life to be potentially taken away by the Succubus? That could be cool. Hmmm... might be the best way out if you are tired of a particular character...<br/><br/>Oh man... what if I <i>wanted</i> to die, but the succubus kept refusing to kill me! So fun!<br/><br/>Anyway, Soul Leech is awesome. I just want more clarity. Here's another point that is also minor: there is no "when" in Soul Leech. I think it is implied that you have to "at least" kiss someone, but does heavy petting count? What about a Magic Mike style stripper dance? Without the "when" being spelled out, I feel like I might be tempted to use Soul Leech on people from a distance, or without their consent, and then... I get to decide if I can kill them?<br/><br/>I wish there were crossover effects between this skin and the Infernal or Witch. They are radly string dependent and occulty. I don't have any great ideas though.<br/><br/>Awesome skin, Bryan. And my compliments on Michael's artwork.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hitchcock" title="Hitchcock"><img alt="Hitchcock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415626/#Comment_415626" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T16:40:45+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  4:40PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul T: I have seen the Succubus and played with it a few times. My group feels the Succubus is a bit over-powered. I find it odd and very victim-y. The Incubus is an attempt to make a more demonic version of the same idea, a predator.<br/><br/>Mathalus: Thanks for your comments. Dark Wings is my attempt to make flight interesting and story driven, rather than just a form of transportation. Any of the Demonic Powers can be given to a sex partner, but it requires sex. Summoning lets you give the power to someone with just a hot and heavy kiss. Yes, in the sex move it should say Infuse rather than Activate. Good catch.<br/><br/>With Soul Leech, it may not be voluntary if the recipient has been mesmerized. It is like the vampire feeding move, except it is a core part of the skin and has a roll attached to it. As to the "when" I will take a look at that. The idea is that when you either make-out or have sex with someone, the move triggers. The move requires physical contact and lack of resistance, if not consent. So a captured person or a hypnotized person could be soul leeched. That would be a pretty dramatic and serious situation in most of the games I run. But I wanted a skin that was a bit villain-y.<br/><br/>There is a sort of crossover with the other skins. The Incubus is more demonic than the Infernal, though I could imagine them making a good couple. The Ward power is a direct defense against witchy cursings, without completely negating any chance a witch might have of hexing an Incubus. I wonder what would happen if an Incubus were bound by a witch to do no damage. That's an interesting question for MCs and players to explore, I feel.<br/><br/>Finally, on the killing thing. I fully intended it to work like the vampire move, which in my reading, would allow PCs to avoid death in the usual manners: losing all their strings or going to Darkest Self, which might be bad for the Incubus. On the other hand NPCs can be easily killed which could make the Incubus truly monstrous or a victim of his/her own power, depending on how they feel about the NPC. As an MC I would rarely have the a 6-on Soul Leech lead to the victim's death. If anything the best result for that is to give the "victim" one of the Incubus's powers and turn it around on them.<br/><br/>Thanks for the comments and praise. I will let Mike know the image was well received.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415630/#Comment_415630" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T17:54:19+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  5:54PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why does the Incubus have a band?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415633/#Comment_415633" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T18:27:03+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  6:27PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because the Devil has the best tunes, naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415636/#Comment_415636" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-06T19:06:41+00:00" title="June  6, 2013  7:06PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

I do have a few issues with both the mechanics and the design, that I'll share in case they are of interest:<br/><br/>The Demonic powers seem a little overpowered to me without seeing them in play.  I imagine it might be frustrating to be another player in a game where there's a Incubus, they have the ability to beat down anybody, manipulate anybody, and summon/appear to anybody, as long as they keep recharging.  I like my PC-NPC-PC triangles as much as the next guy, but the Incubus can turn a triangle into a line pretty trivially.<br/><br/>The Skin makes it seem like the Demonic powers are all one-shots that have to be recharged with another Kiss to use again, but it doesn't actually say that anywhere. <br/><br/>The design issues are all interrelated, so I'll put them all in one paragraph: I don't think I've ever seen another Skin which incentivizes killing as much as this one does -- all the Moves point in the same direction of fighting, seducing, and possibly killing.  It feels a bit on-the-nose to me, without the ability to play against type that other Skins like the Ghoul have, where it can be a lot of fun to chase your Hunger, or also fun to fight your Hunger until you can't any more.  Even Vampires, Serpentines, and Infernal characters are open to being played as reluctant monsters who keep stumbling over their instincts. But a chaste Incubus wouldn't have anything to do, except maybe use Dark Wings a lot.  I feel like Monsterhearts Skins should have a healthy dose of moral ambiguity, and this one doesn't.  Also, it seems sort of pointless to use in a PG-13 rated Monsterhearts game, which is probably not a big concern for some folks but some gamers it's a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hitchcock" title="Hitchcock"><img alt="Hitchcock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416760/#Comment_416760" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-20T22:46:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2013 10:46PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi. Thanks for the feedback. There's been another update to the skin linked above and several play-tests. People seem to have a great time with the skin. I've just altered some of the support text to be less threatening and play up the pathos a bit.<br/><br/>I added an STD move, similar to the Queen's move Many Bodies.<br/><br/>Tainted Love: When you have sex with someone, they get +1 forward to lie, cheat, or steal. They also get this move.  <br/><br/>The Demonic Powers are actually a bit of a challenge to get. And even when you do, they are still subject to the whims of the dice. In comparison to the Succubus skin's automatic successes, the Incubus is a bit underpowered. The demonic powers let you roll as if your stat were 3, this comes as a big help to weak characters but doesn't make an auto-success for characters with a +2 already. An advance is required to have access to all the powers. <br/><br/>Demonic Powers are one use only. The language has been clarified to say "expended". If anything, it is too difficult to provoke the Incubus' Darkest Self. As dark as it is, that is kind of a good thing. <br/><br/>What the Incubus is really all about is having sex. Killing people creates corpses and problems and heartache. I've only seen the choice made to kill a victim during the Incubus's Darkest Self. The strings and powers make it worthwhile to keep your food alive. <br/><br/>A chaste incubus is exactly the model for this skin. The succubus in The Gates is a girl who can't kiss the boys she loves because she might kill him. What's sadder than a monster afraid to use his/her powers? The skin also models the main character from Lost Girl pretty well. I take your point, there is little moral ambiguity with the Incubus. It knows what it wants. I also hear you on the PG-13. I play and run games that seem Rated R, but really suggest more than they actually show. However the discussion is frank. This is also an issue for the Succubus skin, and I think any Infernal with a Butcher for a dark passenger.<br/><br/>The Incubus is about sex and rock and roll. I play mine as Lizzie Hale from Halestorm, who's lyrics are perfect inspiration. =&gt;<br/><br/>\\m/<br/><br/>.ps If anyone uses this skin in a game, I'd love to hear about it. There are MH games on Infrno.net several nights a week right now.
