Before this, I played one session of the 1st edition about a decade ago. I've never played the wargame. I played the MMO for a few days. I'm not all that familiar with the setting other than its grim, gritty, and low magic. I also have no sacred roleplaying cows, and in fact relish games that throw away traditional trappings - as long as it makes for a fun experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Well, Warhammer has definitely thrown out all of the sacred cow with the bath water and filled the tub back up with a different style of fun. The short answer is that this is still every bit an RPG as D&amp;D, Spirit of the Century, FATE, HERO, GURPS, and many other games ranging from large scale to independent publishing. A lot is different from any of those. And the differences seem bigger than D&amp;D 4E's changes. But they are also superficial. The main difference is that instead of writing down the damage you've taken, you track it via chits. Instead of writing down your special abilities, you use cards. Instead of enacting a special ability, you trade in special dice. Instead of memorizing pages of combat rules, you've got it down on your combat cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Immediately the game looked more like a European boardgame with the box's contents spread out on the table. There were cardboard counters for the characters and enemies, a slew of custom dice, cards of various sizes (actually, just two sizes I believe) and lots of chits and counters. I'm told it's a very Fantasy Flight setup. However, there is no map. In a refreshing counter point to 4E, all map oriented stuff is done abstractly. I like this. I love 4E and its use of the map, but I like having another (the only other?) high production fantasy RPG take a different path. Brian did creative things, using the counters arrayed on the table to set the scene for the combat, he used some of the chits to note distance and some setting cards to note where a fallen wagon was, or a particularly thick copse of trees. The system is built for this level of abstraction, and gives you plenty of materials to set it up. I like what it does for my imagination. <br/><br/><br/><br/>As Brian went over the basics I was also quickly struck by how much roleplaying potential there is. I need more than combat from a game, and looking down on the character sheet (which was only about 8" x 5", maybe smaller) I saw there was a great potential for roleplaying. The stats are evenly split between physical and mental, and there's the ability to get worn down in both areas.  Although there wasn't time for a non-physical conflict, so, I'm not quite sure how that works.  There's a slew of standard skills which you can have at four training levels (including untrained) evenly split between the two categories as well.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, I should note, while my mind instantly started swimming with role-playing potential, I don't think this is a revolution in story gaming or anything like that. At best it's a notch down from Spirit of the Century (which is still a very high notch for me), a type of game that still plays traditionally, but allows for a lot more variety in conflicts and player input than we played in the 80's and 90's. This isn't the next Dogs in the Vineyard or Polaris (from what I played), nor is it trying to be. However it appears to have a more modern design and robust play support than GURPS, HERO, White Wolf's Storytelling, or even D&amp;D 4E. (And again, we didn't get to play anything but a combat, so this is just my guess looking at the character sheet and getting a rules overview.) As Brian put it, the familiar trappings of roleplaying games have been removed and replaced by board game elements that do the exact same thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aside from 6 stats and a bunch of skills, your character also has some equipment (weapons and armor seemed to be the only important items), a name and career, and rare or customized skills (not clear if the latter is possible). There are some skills that you can only use if you are trained in them, like Education that the Elf pre-gen had. I like this method intead of asterisks or relying on memorizing which ones need to be trained (D&amp;D 3E I'm looking at you). There was more on the back, such as notes for additional equipment or career path choices, but we did not use any of it for the demo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Off the character sheet you mainly have action cards and a stance track. The stance track shows whether you are in a reckless stance or a conservative stance. Each action card has two faces, the one you use depends on your stance. Some careers like the trollslayer favor reckless. Others like the elven envoy favor conservative. I was playing a Roadwarden, which was evenly balanced between the two. There's also a neutral stance, but it seems clear you do not want to be there unless you have to (such as when you are moving from reckless to conservative).  Action cards tell you what abilities the action is based on, and special effects from the dice. Everything you need. All abilities have a number in the upper corner. This is a recharge number. Many of our abilities had zero's, meaning they could be used every round. Others had a 2 or 3. Using one of these means I need to wait that many rounds before I can use it again. Certain effects of other actions can increase or decrease the recharge time. What was really nice is that I felt like the 0 powers still felt very useful and powerful, unlike 4E's at wills which are often lack luster compared to encounters and dailies. Part of the reason for this is that dice play a big part in action results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The special dice work very much like Don't Rest Your Head. There's a variety of colors, some of them are good to have in your pool, some of them are bad. They are all custom and come with the box. <br/><br/><br/><br/>You have blue Characteristic dice which are based on the stat you are using for your action. <br/><br/><br/>Then you have green Conservative and red Reckless dice. Depending on your stance, you can swap a certain number of these for characteristic dice. The Reckless dice have some additional risk, but also chances at additional successes. The Conservative dice has very little risk, but there is a chance that your action will go slower (I'm not clear on exactly how, though, I rolled two hour glasses and it didn't delay my action).<br/><br/><br/>There are the gold Expertise dice. If you are trained in a skill (like Melee Weapons) you add this for each level of training. In addition to a chance at more successes, you can get a chance for criticals as well.<br/><br/><br/>Then there are white Fate dice, which you can add to your pool by spending fate points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That's all the good dice. All the good dice have hammers on some or most of their sides. You count up the hammers to determine success. On all the cards I saw, one was all you needed, but three would give you some sort of bonus. Eagles give you some sort of boon, and you usually need two. And there's the comet, only on the Expertise dice, which can give you a crit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now for the bad dice. Bad dice have skulls, which can cause bad things to happen and cancel out eagles. Two skulls usually triggers something bad on many abilities, although if you are reckless you may only need one. And crossed swords cancel out hammers.<br/><br/><br/>There are the Black misfortune dice. These can be added by the GM when conditions are less than optimal (such as its dark, or rainy, or there is interference of some kind). And purple Conflict dice, which act as difficulty dials. Usually you'll have one, two, or three conflict dice for easy, medium, and hard difficulties.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The dice rolling is fun. You are always building a pool, and it's just one roll resolution. There are no opposed rolls. Any active resistance just kicks up the number of Conflict dice that goes into your pool.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Damage is fairly straight forward. It's tracked by wound cards, and when you reach your wound threshold you are out, or dead, or I'm not sure but it's bad. You can flip over wound cards for critical hit results as well, which can have special effects like being dazed to grievous wounds and dismemberment (or at least, so I was told). All the fun of critical hit charts without the chart. The combat seems potentially as gritty as Warhammer should be, but it's hard to say as we didn't have time for a full combat after rules explanation and story set up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>All said and done, it was a fun time, and definitely a game I'd like to play more. Actually, I'm way more excited about the engine and design choices than I am the story and setting. I'm curious how the system lends itself to modding. I'd love to be able to use it like D&amp;D's broad fantasy brush, but I'll have to wait until the box is out to see how flexible the careers are.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For all that you get in the box, the $100 price tag is a steal. Even so, I question whether you get enough. There did not seem to be a huge slew of monster counters. I could see quite a racket from producing box sets of new monsters and characters and other counters (I should note it was all thick card board, no minis of any kind - although you could use them if you wanted). Although outside of the visual element, you can easily use beads, dice, or any other token stand in for monsters, characters, and the various chits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another question that remains is GM workload. Brian was referencing the adventure booklet for the enemies. So, I'm not sure if enemies have similar action cards or stat blocks (ala 4E) or what. I hope the GM load is as streamlined as the player side of it, but have no insight into that yet.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The demo proved to me that I'll enjoy this game, and it's everything I hoped it would be. New mechanics that are focused on fun and ease of play, ignoring RPG tropes that have been around since Gary and Dave invented them simply because no one thought to try something else. This is another landmark in what's turning out to be an awesome revolution in RPGs as better game design works its way into the industry. I probably won't line up to buy the game at launch, but I am eyeing the 38% off Amazon price as a great buy. If I loved the Warhammer setting more, or if I had a regular group that I knew I was going to launch a campaign for, I think it's still a steal at the $100 price.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It does have a potential to go beyond RPG players, with its slick packaging and various bits. I'm not one to predict whether it will or not. I'm one who believes that Primetime Adventures should be in every family's game closet, after all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242253/#Comment_242253" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T15:26:30+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  3:26PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2009 3:29PM by Sanglorian.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the report, Alvin! 3rd edition looks exciting!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Brian did creative things, using the counters arrayed on the table to set the scene for the combat, he used some of the chits to note distance and some setting cards to note where a fallen wagon was, or a particularly thick copse of trees.

Thus, my demo was heinously damaged by a well meaning but woefully underprepared GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I did see enough to be quite intrigued.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cons I took away:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) judging from the amount of flipping back and forth and searching for rules it seemed like the books suffered from a tremendous lack of organization magnified by a lack of an index.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The layout of the bestiary in particular seemed unfortuneate with a two page spread (nice) for each type of creature but apparently NOT every rule you need to actually play the creature.  This is certainly a prep issue but the monsters entry listed their damage as "by weapon" with no data block for their weapons...requiring more flipping in another book to uncover the stats for their weapons.  Fixable with proper GM prep...but crap...not the kind of prep I have any desire to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The game desperately needed player reference aids and a GM screen.  Certain rules like when to remove recharge tokens for actions vs. talents and what the formula is for checking damage and whether you can buy as many Crits as you have Boons for (no just 1) were neither intuitive nor easy to look up.  There were lots of fiddly rules, like fatique and stress which add bad dice when they get above the stat you're using, what you can actually do during a Rally (i.e. Short Rest), how many First Aid rolls you can make and how the different types (recover wounds vs. suppress crits) are rolled.  I'm sure many of these would be second nature to long term players...but before you get long term players you need to encourage new players to keep playing.  The demo material was IMO pretty horrible at making the game look easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The demo was The Suck:   A good demo should have been effective to run right out of the kit even with the limited prep my GM did.  Rules references, quick guides, summaries.  Not to mention the plot was dumb.  The final challenge involved a cowardly merchant rescued from a bunch of beastment who instead of being grateful refused to hand over the McGuffin and instead required a Negotation Challenge to convince him...huh?   The choice is give me the package or we leave you here to get eaten...what cowardly merchant is going to "negotiate" in a time like that...dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) I realize the demo was primarily to demo mechanics and so they wanted to demo WHF's version of a Skill Challenge in a compressed demo environment but if you're going to demo your mechanic...you should make the effort to make it FUN.  That negotiation was excruciating.  I'm REALLY hoping this was just the unprepared GM totally flubbing the rules...because if that's how the challenge actually works...OMG...best described as painfully tedious.  Build a track with a whole bunchy of spaces...then you and your opponent race counters down the track to get to the "event" token first.  All players roll but regardless of successes you only move 1 space...each time you have to do the "say what you do" thing...with that many spaces we would have run out of interesting things to say...really after the second one.  The GM (being a good GM even if he didn't know the rules well) promptly said..."this is stupid, let's end it here".<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because I was interested already I filtered the experience such that I gave it the benefit of doubt.  The GM, being an old WHF veteran immediately concluded..."this is stupid, I'm sticking with 2nd Ed" and I expect the other players who were new to WHF won't be ever interested in playing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo boo to the GM for not bothering to learn the game he was demoing...but double boo to the demo designers for designing a demo that, near as I could tell, was ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242263/#Comment_242263" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T17:23:56+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  5:23PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I played this on Saturday too.<br><br>Unfortunately the GM running it was an old WH veteran who hadn't been following the development on the fantasy flight site and the week before the demo still thought it was just a minor tweak.

Actually, I'm not sure if he had "fallen wagon" specifically it was covered up by monsters for most of the scene so I never got a clear look. It might have been a forest card. This might have been improvisation, just using cards that were already out.  The thick copse of trees was definitely a Trees card.<br><br>Though I do have to say that overall, the cards were a little too small to be very evocative.  Their best use is probably holding them up, showing them around the table before setting them down (Brian did this when we entered the forest with a Forest card).\n<blockquote>As for the chits, I thought there was a range card that you can set minis/tokens down on - I didn't think you needed to use chits.</blockquote>\nHmm, maybe. I didn't look at all the box pieces.  That also might have been improvisation on Brian's part to reuse as many pieces as possible.  I didn't see any range cards.\n<blockquote>The focus on arms and armor is going to annoy those who wanted a small and vicious dog!</blockquote>\nThere was actually another section that took up a good bit of space, but I don't recall what it was because we never used anything from it (and I think it might have been empty for my character).\n<blockquote>I don't understand what you mean by the 'method' for trained-only skills. The system you described seemed identical to D&amp;D 3E's.</blockquote>\nIt's really a character sheet organization thing. All the skills you can use without special knowledge are pre-printed onto the sheet.  The special skills are written down into a different part of the sheet.  In 3E, skills like Spellcrafting and Pick Locks (IIRC) were on every character sheet even though they required training to use at all.\n<blockquote>Did it seem to you that all the different flavours of good dice were necessary? It seems one or two would have been quite enough.</blockquote>\nWell, they could probably meld Expertise (Yellow) and Fate (White) dice as they are both d6, but the fact that the only way to get a Comet (which does crit and other potentially good things) is by skill training makes these dice - as well as skill training - much more important than simply spending a Fate point. I suspect and hope there is other potential emergent play and a feedback loop that is present from having the multiple die types.<br><br>Certainly the rest of the dice added different flavor. For example Misfortune (Black) dice can give you a lot of skulls, which is very bad news, but they don't cancel successes, but Conflict (Purple) dice have a chance for both, but mostly success cancellations (and I may have these names wrong, hence the colors). Likewise the two stances make them both better than sticking with Characteristic (Blue) dice, but the Reckless (Red) dice have a much greater risk for reward. I was comparing these two quite close. The Green die only had one bad face (of 10) and that was blank, a couple of eagles, hammers+eagles and a couple of hammers+hourglass (slow action). The Red dice have 4 (of 10) two of them blank, and two skulls, but almost all the other faces are either double hammers or hammer+eagles.  By comparison, the Blue dice have 1 or 2 blanks (of 8), and the rest of the faces are only hammers OR eagles, never both.<br><br>Plus, I found it enjoyable to build the pool. And as a GM, I can see the fun in throwing a Black or Purple die into a player's hand.\n<blockquote>Did it seem to you that you had too much to keep track of? For example, that there was way too much going on, what with this recharging then and these two eagles making this special effect except there's a skull. This seems like a real danger of the system.</blockquote>\nYes and no.<br><br>Yes, because I'm not quite sure the difference between fatigue, stress, and damage, and how these might adversely affect my character (Brian explained that fatigue can get bad when it builds up to your lowest physical stat, which was 2 for the elf, 3 for me and the dwarf, but I don't recall what happens since it didn't come up), but that's just a matter of reading the book I think.<br><br>However the skulls and eagles and all the dice stuff are pretty straight forward. Every action card lists what happens when you get a certain number. So if you forget what happens with two skulls when you are doing a Melee Attack you just pick up your card and look at it.<br><br/>The demo ended right after I used the only recharge power (everyone else did 0 charge abilities). That seemed simple enough. Put a number of chits onto the card and remove one after every round. The danger there is that you might forget. So I'm iffy on the process. I know in 4E I've forgotten to roll for monster powers to recharge. I'd need to see it in a longer play session. But it seems like an easy habit to get into, even as a GM, just to announce a reminder for the whole table.\n<blockquote>Did the mechanics pull you out of the flow of the role-playing? This might be hard for you to answer since you say you mainly focussed on combat, and then only an incomplete battle.</blockquote>\nNope, not really. It was actually kind of hard for me. I played the Roadwarden, sort of middle of the road, leader type. My stance track was even reckless and conservative, so I could have gone either way, and it usually takes me some time to get a feel for a character under those circumstances. However, for the other two, the reckless heavy stance for the Trollslayer and the conservative heavy stance for the Elven Envoy seemed to help them. The Trollslayer definitely dove into being reckless, and the elf hung back and used his bow.  So, I can't really say with any clarity. But I don't think they would have gotten in the way.  I didn't see anything that would help in any way, either. There were no traits like FATE Aspects or DitV traits that reinforce characterization. So for the most part, players are still required to do some heavy lifting. I'm just not sure how much.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242279/#Comment_242279" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T19:51:49+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  7:51PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I recall, assuming it was correct, if your Fatigue / Stress exceeds the stat you're using you get an extra black die for each additional point.  Wounds didn't seem to do anything until they matched your wound level and went down, except for crits which had a variety of effects from mildly annoying to oh, crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere did seem like the potential for good tactical play in combat.  I had been following the design blog on the FF site so I had read up on using maneuvers to close range bands, so I had my elven archer close to medium range and shoot.  This, it turned out, was a mistake because what I didn't know is that you can take fatigue to close more than one range band and the enemy boss had a charge move that let him close to engagement range for free, so what I thought was a safe move that would allow me to shoot a couple of times wound up getting me virtually gacked.  Which I would have done differently had I known.  I'm not sure about the "spend a fatigue" to maneuver again rule.  With fatigue not doing much until you have 3-4 of them, not doing THAT much even then, and being totally recovered after a rally (and with the GM's characters not needing to survive the encounter)...it seems at first blush to be pretty cheap to just rack up the fatigue to move whereever you want...potentially minimizing the point of tracking range bands.  I'm hoping to discover more depth to it than that when I get my copy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242283/#Comment_242283" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T21:01:02+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  9:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite>So did the GM have a 'Fallen Wagon' card and a 'Trees' card?</blockquote>\nHe did!  Actually, I'm not sure if he had "fallen wagon" specifically it was covered up by monsters for most of the scene so I never got a clear look. It might have been a forest card. This might have been improvisation, just using cards that were already out.  The thick copse of trees was definitely a Trees card.<br><br>Though I do have to say that overall, the cards were a little too small to be very evocative.  Their best use is probably holding them up, showing them around the table before setting them down (Brian did this when we entered the forest with a Forest card).<br/><br/>There was a card in the set for an Old Dirt Road - which I used to mark the general area of the coach and melee - and Forest Glade (which I used to mark some cover).  Both were cards from the basic set.<br/><br/>I would have liked an extra card or two (Coach, etc.) to support the specific demo. \n<blockquote><blockquote>As for the chits, I thought there was a range card that you can set minis/tokens down on - I didn't think you needed to use chits.</blockquote>\nHmm, maybe. I didn't look at all the box pieces.  That also might have been improvisation on Brian's part to reuse as many pieces as possible.  I didn't see any range cards.</blockquote>\nThere were no range cards provided.  According to the rules as I grokked them, you use some of the generic tokens  to mark off the general range increments between PC / NPC / card locations.  1 for close, 2 medium, 3 long.  I started the groups at long range - represented by 3 tokens - and then let them move from there.<br/><br/>I found the abstracted movement both one of the interesting parts, and somewhat suprising, given WFRP's miniatures upbringing and parent.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242286/#Comment_242286" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T21:11:44+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  9:11PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2009 9:16PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1000buffalo</cite>I will say that for the games I ran at EndGame, I ran into two consistent items - one, yea, the scenario was pretty lame.

The scenario itself was made available maybe a couple days before that, but made no sense without the game itself.<br/><br/>Please cut your FLGS some slack on this one, everyone!

We'll have to see how they handle that part of it; the folks who showed at our demo seemed to really quite like it, but were conspicuous in their failure to place a pre-order.<br/><br/>Did anyone who played it see a potential problem in how tightly designed it seems to be for 3-4 players?

They suggested using the Warden and the Elf as the primary "plot" drivers (each having a McGuffin to hunt) if you only had two...but without the Dwarf tank we got our ass handed to us pretty promptly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this was a demo failing, not a hard coded game feature, but I will suggest that given the structure* of the game it's probably best to plan on parties of only 2-3 characters...which I think is more reasonable from a "story" perspective anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe D&amp;D; structure is a large number of very short turns, which can handle a larger party because it cycles pretty quickly if everyone knows what they're doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe WHF structure is a small number of longer turns.  While some of the length is learning curve, much of it is interacting with the game components, selecting a card, slotting talents, adjusting cool down, etc. etc.  The battle will only last 2-3 rounds but each players turn takes a fair amount of time, which I suspect will lead to undesired lengths of down time in larger groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244346/#Comment_244346" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T07:27:01+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:27AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update after having read through the rules now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome corrections / expansions to my demo inspired comments above:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The books are not as terribly organized as I'd feared.  They are, however, organized based on readability not for referrability which makes the lack of an effective index doubly heinous.  There are, however, a couple of parts where a key bit of information (of the sort "what do you do in this situation) is just missing.  I neglected to catalog for reference and questioning the game forums, but there were at least 3 occassions when reading the rules when I remember thinking "Ok, so now I need to know "X"...and....no "X" (gah)".  Next time through I'll have to write them down as I encounter them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The bestiary layout is actually pretty good.  The concern about having to flip around to get the weapon data was incorrect.  The demoer had missed the (admittedly small and inconspicously placed) paragraph that said the monster block already built in the standard weapons into the listed stats.  One poor organization tidbit is that the rules indicate that the monster stats list the specific actions the monsters get -- in addition -- to the "basic actions" that everyone gets.  But then neglects to list what those basic actions are...which I believe can only be found in the character creation section of the players book.  Doh!<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The game is actually not nearly as fiddly as the disorganized demo made it appear.  It seemed like a lot of unnecessary chrome, but subsequent discussions with the GM indicate alot of bias that no doubt was reflected in the demo.  He has repeatedly stated that he's certain that "real gamers" would just use paper and pencil and that therefor all of the tokens and shifting game components around was just "fluff to make the box heavier".  Actually, the rules give pretty good advice for using the tokens as effective game state tracking tools that will (I predict) be easily assimilated into routine play by dedicated Eurogamers used to such components.  A one page reference sheet would still be invaluable (as it typically is for Eurogames with lots of bits to track).<br/>\n<br/>\n4) The demo was indeed the suck, but the sample adventure in the GM's book (which is nearly 1/4 to 1/3 of the book) reads like it would be a much better adventure, although the initial hook into the adventure is weak (as such preplanned things typically are).<br/>\n<br/>\n5) The progress trackers are not nearly the disastor they appeared to be in the game.  The way I would have intuitively set it up to work in the demo is, in fact, exactly the way the rules say to do it.  I don't know where he got the method we were doing but it was unnecessary.  I think he confounded a couple of different things.  The "Progress Tracker" concept is a fairly universal idea to be applied to everything from tracking enemy morale, the spread of a plague, the course of an investigation, the time until a murderer strikes again, diciphering an ancient tome, a chase, tracking a enemy through the woods, a long distance trek, etc, etc, etc.  And each of those can be set up in a unique customized fashion with customized ways of deciding when the tokens advance and what it means when they reach specified event spaces on the track.  The rules provide a list of ideas on what to use it for, a bunch of sample mechanics and ways to assemble the track, and some specific examples of a built track being used and then expect you to mix and match the ideas for whatever need you have.  I was rather impressed by the use for monster morale with what sort of things move the morale on the track and how to determine which monsters flee when different steps on the track are reached.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome new things that I discovered.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) or confirmed really.  The dice really are slick.  The ability to convert basic ability dice into Reckless or Conservative dice based on stance is really interestingly tactical (especially combined with actions that work differently depending on what stance you're in).  We'd been doing it wrong (of course) and letting players freely select stance (which eliminated a large cycle of decision making).  By the rules changing your stance is just one of the things you can do on your turn.  The game mechanically supports the GM being free with bonuses for clever player ideas.  All that stuff in Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard where Luke bemoans weasels who try to get extra dice from crazy forks and bizarre Wise uses...not really a problem in the new WH.  Fortune dice are nice, but each one doesn't shift the odds that much, so if the players weasel a couple of extra...no biggie.  Its balanced by misfortune dice which allow the GM to throw in "bad things happen" dice for the same sorts of reasons "yeah but you're fighting with the sun in your eyes and the slope is slippery so take two Black Dice also.  The GM is free to invent modifiers for all of the environmental effects he wants with no need to refer to exhausting lists and little worry of heinously messing up the probability curve.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The GM advice is a bizarre mix of hoary old Illusionist advice (including such chestnuts as fudging the dice and "all roads lead to rome) as well as a fairly structured flow chart of adventure design complete with a system for players providing plot hooks and the GM defining systemized "triggers" that move play to the next sequence.  It reminded me alot of CRPG play where the new area isn't "opened up" until you deliver the package to guard <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> and thus "trigger" him unlocking the gate for you.  The game included several pages on a really bizarre interpretation of the "Three Act Structure".  Where most of us would think in terms of scenes being the building blocks of an Act, and 3 Acts charting the course of the story, WHFRP puts the 3 Acts at the micro level...literally using 3 Acts to mean 3 Actions.  Instead of scenes they call them "episodes" and give each episode its own 3 Act Structure.  For instance the players arrive in a tavern looking for answers.  Act one is the rising action as the patrons become increasingly hostile to the player's questions.  Act Two is the big climactic bar fight.  Act Three is the falling action where the defeated foes finally cough up the clue.  Rinse and Repeat.  The game does go out of its way to say not all episodes need to be structured this way, but I found it very strange to be thinking of the 3 Acts on such a micro scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill haven't read the magic or religion book...but like most Fantasy RPGs those will probably take an otherwise simple straightforward system and complicate it in crazy and needless ways.   But then, I'm the guy who always plays fighters because I can't be bothered to learn the game's magic rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244354/#Comment_244354" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T07:54:41+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, after you get a chance to play this at your table, we should cast about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian, I look forward to hearing you talk about this on 2d6 feet quite a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244359/#Comment_244359" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T08:35:34+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  8:35AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            there is one of the cards that has a small, vicious, dog.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sanglorian</cite><br><br>The focus on arms and armor is going to annoy those who wanted a small and vicious dog!<br><br/></br></br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244380/#Comment_244380" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T10:20:35+00:00" title="December  1, 2009 10:20AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ogre, love to.
