Basically, I wanted a place where I could get a solid survey of all (read "most"/"many") of the smaller press RPGs that came out that year, and find more about them (to perhaps fuel purchases for myself, which it did). As for assigning winners and maintaining the awards, I was interested in that aspect less, and far more interested in giving qualitative ("wordy") feedback to the authors/writers rather than quantitative ("300 people voted that they liked your game"); and keeping a list of that year's releases.<br/><br/>This year, too: I ended up discovering 4 games (by looking at the All Registered Games list) that I never heard of, and even picked up one of them!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225901/#Comment_225901" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T12:25:43+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 12:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so, lets start with Game of the Year. <br/><br/>For those who don't know when you vote on a category you get to pick 3 different games. Your first choice gets a large amount of points, your second a medium amount of points, and your third a small amount of points. <br/><br/>I think, based on my hazy recollections, that I voted like this: <br/><br/>1) Solar System<br/>2) In A Wicked Age<br/>3) A Dirty World <br/><br/>So its notable there that I didn't vote for Mouse Guard. Not because I have anything against it, and I fully think it probably deserved to win, but because MG didn't hit me the way these three games did. <br/><br/>My comments about them were: <br/><br/>Solar System: Normally I'd never consider giving a reprint or remake of a game my nod. However, Solar System represents the strength of creative commons and open game movements in a profound way. The fact that the rules are now better than ever, both more solidly explained and further expanded without losing the core focus of the game, and that it was done by different authors in different countries shows that despite the end of the d20/OGL there is still viability in the concept of open gaming. <br/><br/>Wicked Age: By focusing on serial fiction rather than either simple single stories or ongoing novels, Baker has managed to do the best homage yet to the pulpy, hard hitting swords and sorcery genre that we've yet managed to produce. <br/><br/>A Dirty World: A Dirty World is a little bit of a hidden surprise, which doesn't reveal its full complexity until after you've actually managed to play it. The layering of secrets, character's whose very personality and morality are up for grabs and constantly under negotiation, and a gritty noir sense all work together to form a package of surprising power. <br/><br/>And for the category as a whole I'd said: "A very strong field this year, showing a growing sense of diversification and love of production as simplistic boundaries of "trad" and "indie" as labels of content rather than production start to fall down."<br/><br/>Which, of course, is now ironic given the "what is and is not indie" debate is rearing its head again. BUT LETS NOT TALK ABOUT THAT. <br/><br/>Anyway, I was also tempted to throw some love towards Barbarians of Lemuria and Hellas, because both are in many ways "traddy" games in execution, but by the time I got to it I found I didn't have the votes to do it. So sorry guys, it was a tight field this year and so my votes went elsewhere. <br/><br/>I'll also say that I think A Dirty World is seriously overlooked by a lot of the community, and has a wonderful lot of worth to it. The book could use some serious additions about "how to run this and make it work" -- but then so could many games. <br/><br/>Up next: Supplement of the Year and Brand Fucks Up and Makes a Public Apology                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225902/#Comment_225902" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T12:25:53+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 12:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't vote in the awards, but I see that Zombie Cinema did pretty well.

My comment, more fluff than tough, was: Liquid cool. A supplement with more mojo than the original game. <br/><br/>It's possible to read that and think I was dissing DRYH, but I wasn't. I like DRYH and think it pretty cool too. But DLYM does something that I like supplements to do -- it kicks up in flavor, spice, and octane the things the the more workmanlike core book setup. So DRYH had a lot of cool stuff in it, but it also had to do a lot of heavy lifting and the boring part of game writing -- the actual, functional rules without which everything else falls to crap. Because it did its job so well, DLYM was able to come along and throw a whole new level of weight behind it, and managed to actually get me on track to run a game of DRYH, which I hadn't done since the core book first came out. <br/><br/>And then there was my screw up. A big, embarrassing screw up. I could make excuses about how I had limited net, about how I was on vacation, and blah blah blah, but here is the sad fact. <br/><br/>When I voted for Archipelago (comment: "Communication, procedure, and rules for the above take center stage above mechanics in this..."), I was misreading where I was on the screen due to voting via blackberry. I thought I was voting for Matthijs's game, and not for what I was actually voting for. <br/><br/>This is a screw up, and I would like to apologize to everyone involved for it. I should have been more careful, whatever the circumstances, and I hope everyone can forgive the mistake. <br/><br/>So, other than me boning it, I'd also like to note what a short list field this was. Apparently Indie RPGs don't do supplements much -- but stuff like Don't Lose Your Mind shows that it can be done well. I think we should avoid supplement treadmills, but that doesn't meant this isn't an area worth some further work. <br/><br/>Next: Many more awards, all in one post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225918/#Comment_225918" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T12:52:37+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 12:52PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best Free Game: Sufficiently Advanced -- The best testimonial I can give this game is that for several weeks one of my friends didn't know it was a free game. He assumed that its quality and production meant it must have been a game we'd paid for. <br/><br/>And that was the only vote I cast. <br/><br/>Why? Was I not aware of the other games? <br/><br/>Well, I wasn't at all aware of Shell Shock, and had only a passing awareness of Gates and Gorgons. The other games I knew about, but had not spent any critical time appraising, playing, or thinking about. So this left me in an odd place -- I did quite like Sufficiently Advanced, but I almost didn't vote for it at all because I felt that my lack of exposure to the field skewed whatever results I might put in. <br/><br/>This is the field that year after year surprises me. I do keep up with free games in a passing way, but every year I find that I've not heard of more of these games than I've heard of. I blame myself for not being supportive enough, but I also think that the communities emphasis on "publication = pay money" keeps our general signal level about free stuff fairly low. <br/><br/>I'll endeavor to do better at that. <br/><br/>Best Support: I didn't vote at all in this category. The reasons for this are complicated and have to do with a general level of dissatisfaction, complications between personal and professional relationships, and my own disinterest in a lot of the support work around many of the games. There is probably a lot of discussion to be had here, but I don't know that much of it is relevant to the community as a whole, so I'll drop it. <br/><br/>Best Production: <br/><br/>1) Mouse Guard -- Well, what the fuck was I going to say? I didn't vote for it for game of the year, but it was so bloody fucking obvious that it deserved best production that I would have felt dishonest not voting this way. The combination of graphic novel know how, art, layout, and presentation overall -- including little things like the back of the dust jacket -- were all better than most of the stuff the big studios do, much less what smaller groups have done. <br/><br/>2) A Flower For Mara: Photography and realism are, alas, underdone in RPGs. A Flower for Mara takes a much higher stance and plays well to its aesthetic.<br/><br/>3) Mist Robed Gate. Pretty. Oh so Pretty. <br/><br/>All in all I found this one of those categories where there were so many things to vote for that all deserved it that it became almost arbitrary towards the end. The level of technical and aesthetic know how in the various communities has obviously grown a lot. I do feel bad that I didn't vote for something with an indie-punk production vibe though, as I do sometimes think that games like Death's Door often get missed for the games they are because they chose a different type of production value. <br/><br/>But damn, I'm shallow, and Mouse Guard is gorgeous. <br/><br/>Most Innovative Game: <br/><br/>1) A Flower For Mara -- Breaking down the doors between play, LARP, Jeep, improv, and RPG -- A Flower for Mara is a strong step away from the ordinary. <br/><br/>A lot of folks have done a lot of good work in the structured freeform area, but it was this game that made me put up my head and take notice. <br/><br/>2) It's Complicated -- Especially with the online play edition, It's Complicated moves gaming strongly towards the mainstream and thinks about games as something other than adventures imagined around a table.<br/><br/>I also wish I'd said the thing about the relationship web being the mechanics, but I didn't. <br/><br/>3) Sweet Agatha -- Because I have to cut up what? <br/><br/>The thing about this field this year was that I felt there were a lot of games that really were trying to push the boundaries. Things that are not roleplaying games anymore. Not because of the bullshit "D&amp;D is roleplaying and nothing different is" reasons, but because when I think about them I want to use a different, more specific word for them. When I think about playing D&amp;D 4th and playing any one of the three games above, I'm not thinking about the same activity, and its really only historical accident that makes me even think about them as the same hobby. <br/><br/>And to my mind, that's awesome. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Okay, so that's me and my votes. Anyone else want to talk about their reactions? Talk about why my votes were wrong? Right?

My votes went to products that went beyond the book (not my verbatim comments from the awards, just paraphrases):<br/><br/>(5pts) Houses of the Blooded - John Wick recorded a music CD for his game about ven opera!<br/><br/>(3pts) Zombie Cinema - The game, complete with color-coded pieces and dice in an easy-to-carry package<br/><br/>(1pt) Mouse Guard - The dust-jacket as map was a step above.<br/><br/>However, I screwed up!
