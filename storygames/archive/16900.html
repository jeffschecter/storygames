After testing out my latest character creation procedure for Within My Clutches, we were looking for a short game to play.  I pitched Animal Crime: simple rules, storytelling rather than strategy, funny animals + noir, an hour or two.  Sold!<br/><br/>I was psyched to be a suspect with a hidden, sordid story and some level of complicity in the crime, so Joey offered to be the investigator, Marmot Detective.  The other characters were chosen from the 8 provided with the game, and customized as follows:<br/><br/>The Innocent Wronged - Sister Wuggles - puggle - a small, nervous nun<br/>The Son of Society - Remington Ozymandias McCorgi - small dog - elitist snob<br/>The Femme Fatale - Sydney McCorgi - white cat - aloof, charming sophisticate<br/><br/>Joey left the room, and we conspired to concoct The Crime.  We decided the highlight was the murder of playwright Wilde Weasel.  Sister Wuggles had accidentally killed him through rough sex.  This seemed like a hilarious choice at the time, but was actually a horrible idea, because we couldn't bear to think through and discuss the details of the murder scene.  Poor Joey wound up getting some pretty incoherent and contradictory clues.  As for the McCorgis, they were guilty of auxiliary misdeeds: Remington and Sydney were blackmailing Wuggles and Wilde over their affair, hoping both to replenish Remington's empty coffers, and to prevent Wilde from putting on his play about Sydney's affair with teddy bear Theodore Rockefeller.  Not wanting to keep Joey waiting, we called it good enough and called him in.  In retrospect, we probably should have either taken the time to iron out the motives and machinations, or just gone with something simpler.<br/><br/>Actual play was hilarious.  Joey led the noir vibe, while I led the zany animal ridiculousness.  He gave the world-weary voice-over for the chase scene while I was throwing in tricycles with squeaky horns.  Everyone seemed to have a great time combining '40s Bogart movie behavior with whatever animal touches came up.  Sydney's pearl necklace included a bell at the center.  Sydney's hotel had a duck butler who communicated in quacks, followed around by a smaller duck.  Sister Wuggles worshipped at Peter Parrot's Popular Parish.  Remington's posh club included a coat check panda and a beaver butler named Henceforth Puddington III.  Crime scenes were examined from above by web-hanging forensic spiders.<br/><br/>Marmot Detective was approached by Wuggles.  None of us had come up with a good reason to involve a detective, so I loosely conceived that Wuggles was sure she wouldn't be caught for the murder, and wanted to bring shame on the hated McCorgis and expose their misdeeds.  Or maybe she felt guilty and sorta wanted to be caught; I dunno.  I dropped a few hints that I liked Wilde and hated the McCorgis.  Anyway, the Marmot wryly agreed to take the case, lured largely by the McCorgis' money.  He went first to Sydney's hotel, where Remington also made an appearance.  I think Joey succeeded in a roll, which caused Remington's player to reveal a script tucked in Remington's coat.  Then there was some poking around the incoherent crime scene, after which the McCorgis were taken to the police station for questioning.  Marmot Detective hung around outside the interrogation rooms, listening to the cops question Sydney, then Remington.<br/><br/>This was the highlight for me.  Joey played good cop Charlie Fetchit, a helpful golden retriever, while I played bad cop Baboon McSmoothy, a growling tough guy who upped the ante by glaring, finger-pointed, threatening to throw feces, and hanging upside down from the ceiling while drooling.  Sydney's player gave us tears and terror in abundance.  It was glorious.<br/><br/>In the end, I think we clued Joey into the fact that Remington had a script written by Wilde satirizing high society.  But there wasn't really any theory-forming going on.  No "I think I know what's going on here", just moving forward to the next scene in hopes of more puzzle pieces that would add up better.  We stalled out for a bit, so I jumped in with a news report of Theodore Rockefeller's murder.  I figured that's the sort of thing that happens in noir movies when things have slowed down, right?  I was hoping Sydney or Remington might come up with a reason to implicate themselves, but if not, I was happy to say that Wuggles did it in some sort of rage, because Theodore was in on the blackmailing, or she wanted Sydney to know what it's like to lose a lover, or something.  This may have just added to the incoherence, but it did get people moving forward again.<br/><br/>Perhaps we could have done more to divert Marmot Detective into scenes that weren't about the mystery.  We all used our character Moves (Ensnare, Be a Victim, Cry, etc.) unconsciously and liberally, but we never really got personal.  We were all just suspects to the jaded Marmot.  We never really gave him a reason to love the Femme Fatale, get protective of the Innocent Wronged, etc.<br/><br/>Marmot Detective eventually went to the Parish, fired a warning shot, failed a roll, and accidentally gave Wuggles a mortal wound.  She tearfully apologized for what she'd done to Wilde Weasel, but then said that the McCorgis were the real bastards, so please bring them to justice.  Joey first interpreted this as a climactic confession, but then wasn't so sure after my last bit about the McCorgis.  I guess I could have just revealed everything, as our time was running out, but my gut wasn't feelin' it, and nothing in the game told me to, so I just nudged the Marmot back toward the McCorgis with a bit more info.<br/><br/>It turned out the info was too vague, and this late in the game, Joey figured the Marmot had failed.  Of the two concluding options, "reveal the truth" was now off the table, leaving only "die tragically".  The rest of us weren't seeing it, but couldn't come up with an elegant path to revelation, so we eventually got on board with the death.  Sydney smacked Marmot in the head from behind, and the duck butlers wheelbarrowed his unconscious body out a 46th floor window while the police closed in on the McCorgis.  The end!<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I dig the process of uncovering or failing to uncover the mystery -- if I was Marmot, I'd probably resolve not to treat it as a puzzle at all, and just use the hints and clues as fodder to take dramatic action for a fun tale -- but the combo of funny animals + noir is an absolute winner.  I'm always down for filling the dim, grim precinct with clerk Smiley the Octopus, coroner bat Nathan Deathmaggot, et. al.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
