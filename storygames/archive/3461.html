I thought it would be better not to include them in the post, but to answer you specifically:\n<blockquote><cite>Misspent Youth draft text</cite>4.\tStability<br/><br/>Things are very good right now, and The Authority is intent on making them stay that way. Alternatively, things are pretty bad, but The Authority is more intent on them not getting worse than on improving anything. Whatever the state of things, The Authority wants to preserve it.<br/><br/>The school's Plan for Compliance, a process for coping with problem children, calls for corporal punishment, arranges political power for those faculty who most eagerly enact its precepts, states in the handbook that its purpose is to ensure that children learn in an environment free of fear by bullying, and was developed by well-meaning educational theorists who really thought they were improving the lives of children. In the end, though, it is solely concerned with the maintenance of a calm, quiet school.<br/><br/>5.\tUtopianism<br/><br/>The Authority has a vision for how to make the world a perfect place, and is willing to do whatever it takes to make things the way they are supposed to be. An ardent idealist may easily find itself committing the most monstrous acts.<br/><br/>Her Holiness and Most Exalted Prophet Larita Pratcher causes her flock to engage in vicious acts of cruelty, squeezes money and services from her followers, fills her speeches with nightmares about what will happen if she is not obeyed, and promises her apostles a life of calm and ease. All her speeches and rites are focused on her belief that following her Way will lead to a good and proper life, however.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78046/#Comment_78046" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T08:06:11+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  8:06AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2007 8:07AM by Bill_White.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob -- Awesome.

If you check out my response to Bill you'll see that I describe all the ways in which the preacher could be motivated by Fear, Sadism, etc., but point out that what she's <i>really</i> about is Utopianism.<br/><br/>It's easier to understand with characters. You may pick Tough, but that doesn't mean you're not intelligent, even though you didn't pick Smart. You are as smart or dumb as you want to be, but what your character is <i>about</i> is being Tough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78086/#Comment_78086" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T10:53:58+00:00" title="June 27, 2007 10:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm looking forward to our playtest Friday night and will post what we come up with.

It's a good one. <br/><br/>Visage (and all the Authority Traits) do a couple of jobs in the game. They describe it, they're flags (if we decide to create a Government Authority that tells me some things about what we want to see in the game), and they're guidelines for narrating in conflicts (less strict for The Authority than for the Youthful Offenders). In this case, the most important value they provide is probably to describe The Authority and figure out what the world will look like.<br/><br/>I like the idea of organizing principles but it loses some concreteness. I'll ponder. Visage is probably the weakest of the three.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78246/#Comment_78246" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-27T16:42:25+00:00" title="June 27, 2007  4:42PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see.

From an example:\n<blockquote><cite>Misspent Youth draft rules</cite>The Human Purity Coalition (HPC) is terrified of what it will mean for the future of humanity if human/alien romantic relationships are condoned, and are fighting bitterly to prevent acceptance of this deviant practice. To stop these relationships, aliens and alien-lovers are being rounded up and killed or put into internment camps. These camps are planted in desert "wastelands" which are stripped of all natural life. Most of the studies done at the time the aliens first arrived have been rewritten to expunge any mention of genetic compatibility between the two species. Ultimately however, the HPC is terrified of a new structuring of society, and everything it does is aimed at suppressing this change.</blockquote>\nThis is a Fear, Organization, Progress Authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78340/#Comment_78340" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T07:30:48+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  7:30AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Suburban Parents:  Utopianism / Machine / Freedom<br/><br/><br/>That was pretty easy and fun.

In that sense, the only category that I think in insufficiently evocative on its face is "Organization"--could be a church, could be a, um, pyramid scheme, could be whatever. You have to decide which name you think best (a) encapsulates the various possibilities that exist, so as not to constrain player imagination, but (b) make the same sufficiently concrete that it gives players an idea of what an Authority that takes that form looks like.<br/><br/>So rethinking what categories "need" to be there:<br/><br/>Government &lt;--&gt; State [political authority] The Law<br/>Business &lt;--&gt; Corporation [bureaucratic authority] The System<br/>Organization &lt;--&gt; Church [dogmatic authority] The Godhead (God or Mammon)<br/>Individual &lt;--&gt; Demagogue [charismatic authority] The Will of the People (Vox Populi)<br/>Machine &lt;--&gt; Science [epistemological authority] Reality (the Way Things Are)<br/><br/>So a "business"-type authority might either be the System ("Megacorp owns you now!") or the Godhead ("Greed is good!"), depending on whether it sees the YOs as malfunctioning cogs in its machine or as recalcitrant converts to its way of thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78362/#Comment_78362" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T08:39:54+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  8:39AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I need to think.
