Unlike some of you, I haven't done any playtesting, nor read any playtest documents. So I've got to say: Man, this is great stuff. I haven't finished reading it yet, but so far I can tell that Paul has done an amazing job at tackling the ever-present problem of how to simultaneously make a game text teach the game and also be a rules reference while playing, and all this wrapped in an entirely in-fiction voice! It just feels so right. The layout is awesome, and I love the photos. And teaching the game by writing it in such a way that one person is supposed to read it out procedurally to the group, and then start play (ooh but it's all play, it's all in-fiction)? That's really smart, seriously. I'll get to the game later, but right now I'm geeking out about how this is an extremely well put-together gaming product. Kudos Paul, for all your hard work.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Editing this in later: I'm wondering about the decision to not include anything in the front or back or anywhere about this being a game. Obviously this fits with the completely in-fiction nature of the text, but I wonder if Paul has concerns about people not knowing what it is. What do you all think (you too, Paul, if you're around!)? Is it simply a case of "people who buy this game or run into it in a shop will know basically what it is, and if they don't, it's not for them"? I can see a non-gamer leafing through this and going, "Interesting. Now what is this? Real therapy? A joke? A weird little fiction book?" I have a hard time envisioning them latching onto it as a game. But hell, that's probably the same level of understanding when someone sees "a role-playing game" as the subtitle of a book, and maybe that's Paul's point.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212146/#Comment_212146" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T15:36:07+00:00" title="June 13, 2009  3:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sign a urinal and stick it in a gallery; it is now art.

It was Ryan Macklin's idea for me to rewrite text with the "reading instructions" after some playtests he ran at Dreamation 2008.

The important part: "Fountain", and (as you add) the process that created it, are now universally understood to be art, because of their context.  Even insofar as Duchamp may have been earnest, at some point in his career, about wanting to make non-art, his career succeeded mostly in demonstrating that postmodernism allows art to infect everything that comes within spitting range of it.  And now we all have to live with the consequences of his discovery.<br/><br/>Parallel: <i>Penny</i> is sold as game.  If you sell it as a game, it's a game.  If you sell a rock as a game, it probably isn't a very good game, although it might be an interesting critique of games and game-selling.  If you sell a genuine guide to psychiatric treatment as a game... it might be a cool game, actually.  <i>The Feeling Good Handbook</i>, a workbook for serious-minded CBT against depression, might be a provocative thing to see on a shelf next to the PHB, and insight can be fun. Maybe this should get its own thread, actually.<br/><br/>In any case, to the main point: No one would mistake <i>Penny</i> for <i>Feeling Good</i>, not beyond the first page of reading.
