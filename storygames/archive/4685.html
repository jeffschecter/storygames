(I'm looking for the crazy backstabby fighting that characterized certain interpretations of Paranoia, to be precise.)  However, often times, combat systems can be <b>boring</b>:<br/><br/>"I attack."<br/><br/>"Roll to hit."<br/><br/>"Yay I hit." or "Boo I missed."<br/><br/>"Next turn."<br/><br/>There have been exceptions to this.  For example, while I never actually played <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>, I played the combat simulator many times.  I felt engaged because of the meaningful decisions and resource management, tied to the unforgiving nature of the system.  (Any miscalculation could be fatal.)<br/><br/>Another example, from the other side of the design spectrum, is <i>Sons of Liberty</i>.  This is essentially just a combat system, but the real-time card play plus special abilities encourages madcap action, which is fun in a completely different sort of way.<br/><br/>So, here's my question:<br/><br/>What makes combat fun for you?  What are some systems that have consistently brought the awesome for your combats?  Got any good examples where a game system made your combat more gripping/exciting/hair-raising/betterer?<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105550/#Comment_105550" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T12:22:04+00:00" title="October 30, 2007 12:22PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fact that if you lose, you might stop having fun (character death), makes survival the opposite, unknown, exciting, even if the way of determining the result is anything but.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105553/#Comment_105553" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T12:33:40+00:00" title="October 30, 2007 12:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not especially interested in butchery, but I am interested in why people fight.

When I was playing more than GM'ing, 3.5 was the order of the day for just cooking out some baddies and stomping mudholes with my minis. Glorified action figures, with mechanics thinly veiling the let's pretend aspects of narrative-injected wargaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM'ing, however, is a completely different story.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best example comes from a d20 conversion of Battletech. The campaign lasted well over a year and a half, with lots of crowbarring to turn d20 Modern into an angst-ridden story-driven mech combat simulator. The scene involved mechs venturing into an abandoned hangar on a frozen-over ice planet, only to find five story tall monsters lurking in the shadows as they explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made the scene pop was the characterization. Each of these characters piloted these war machines for different reasons; and the mech was made to be another layer of the personality, a Freudian Super Ego whose physical limits and sustained damage reflected the mental states and attitudes of the characters. These monsters were far too massive to take on foot, even for a hundred men; and so the mech served as a metaphor of technology protecting mankind, even as it enslaved mankind (a recurring theme throughout MechWarrior, particularly the Dark Age material). At its' heart, it was merely a dungeon crawl; but the novelty of the scenario combined with a thick, almost stiflyingly serious mood of play (dark room, cold house, no one speaking, everyone caustically self-reflective) made the sudden combat all the more unexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes combat interesting to me isn't the combat, just like Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers wasn't about a man who shot bugs. The action is intense, visceral, dangerous, and scintillating; but it also says something about the world, and how the characters approach survival in a world that's left them behind. That's a recurring theme in my games: characters on the edge of space, reality, the kingdom, sanity, whatever - dynamic choices are made when players, deep into a narrative, are faced with choices for which there is no right answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nLacuna is the best answer to that. With every swing, the Agents are brought one step closer to their heart exploding; even as they grit their teeth and reach their peak in Blue City their bodies are rupturing on the slab, moments away from a horrific, disembodied demise.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat should represent something. Random encounters, when brief and deadly, punctuate the danger of the world outside the village. Think of every fight in those contexts, and people will foam at the mouth for murder, knowing that their fights <i>mean</i> something. At least that's my experience. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105556/#Comment_105556" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T12:46:49+00:00" title="October 30, 2007 12:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2007 12:47PM by Jarrod.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>So make it mean something, or hand wave past it.</blockquote> Hive Mind.

It's also the hardest to implement mechanically, if you're really talking about "meaning for the players" rather than "meaning for the characters."<br/><br/>There really are different approaches to how to make the process of combat fun. The main one, for me, is just like for the rest of roleplaying: <i>make players' choices matter</i>. That includes giving them a good array of choices to begin with. When I played AD&amp;D 2e, the choices were very limited. And out of those, throwing a couple of daggers, for my dex-based character, was always by far the best choice, so that it wasn't even really a choice anymore because the alternatives were not viable.<br/><br/>The second way to do this is to make the narration matter. In other words, allow player ingenuity and creativity to become a focus of the conflict, of each action or at least several important ones. You'll notice that that's a particular preference of mine, as I've designed a game about that whole concept.<br/><br/>Third way: allow me to kick ass. At times this is a whole different play style (wish fulfillment), at other times it's just what needs to happen for the character to realize their place in the story. I don't care about "realism" nearly as much as I do about being a protagonist. Remember how Malcolm Reynolds solves the hostage situation toward the end of the Firefly pilot? Most people do, for a good reason.<br/><br/>Fourth: Make teamwork matter. If we're going to do combat together, allow us to make each other more awesome. Promote the group cohesion and tactics. Put in combos for multiple characters; something more than just buffing/hexing.<br/><br/>I might have more later <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105569/#Comment_105569" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T13:54:33+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  1:54PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because guns and explosions are cool.<br/><br/>That's not "gamist" (if anything is), but still. <br/><br/>Guns and explosions are cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105574/#Comment_105574" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T14:20:02+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  2:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Imagining the action.  Even this can be fun:<br/>"I attack."<br/>"Roll to hit."<br/>"Yay I hit." or "Boo I missed."<br/>"Next turn."<br/><br/>Just as long as it doesn't last too long, because there's a lot of other stuff outside of that: "The goblin is in your face!" "I attack!" or "The minotaur gores the wizard, next!" "I attack!".  Attack is probably the default option, but if there's enough going on, other options present themselves and even if you still go with the attack, considering all those elements are fun.<br/><br/>Because even narrating the action can drag on, so I think what you say doesn't matter as much as what's being imagined.

That direct response of action to consequence without a mediator. A lot of the times when playing D&amp;D or especially GURPS, when all the choices have been made and I narrate my sequence right up until resolution, the clacking of the dice on a table feels like the pull of a trigger, and the experience becomes much more visceral and immersive. Burning Wheel has that great tactical feel, but the <i>tactile</i> feel gets lost in the shuffle, and it feels more like I'm commanding a one man army than actually bashing skulls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105658/#Comment_105658" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T08:37:26+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  8:37AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to admit to a bit of the simulationist bug when it comes to combat. I like tactics to work. I want to see how a grappler fights a boxer, or pit gladiator with net and trident against shield and cestus. I want every creature to have developed tactics that best suits its niche in the ecology and the body that developed to fill that niche. Wolves bring down larger animals with pack tactics. Lion prides add ambush to that mix. Orcs and rats swarm. etc. I want all those techniques to bring different challenges to the table.<br/><br/>I also like the narrativist approach which basically allows for various shades of "you succeed, now tell us how." The descriptive freedom can create fun stories of "can do" swashbuckling.

Mmmmmmm yummy.  There are a few things that a combat system must have in order to be fun.  This is regardless of whether combat is handled just as a part of the normal resolution system or as a separate thing in and of itself.  **Note: This is all my opinion and not some statement of objective truth here.<br/><br/>1.) Characters must always be effective.  Non-effective characters = crappy, not fun play.  This doesn't mean every character has to be the MOST effective, just that no character should be completely useless.  If a character is ineffective in combat situations that player is essentially nothing but an observer and when we're talking about more gamist play being an observer sucks hind tit.  TSoY does a good job at this.  Everyone's effective.  Bonus dice and cool Secrets make everyone a viable participant in combat.<br/><br/>2.) Players must always have choices.  Personally, more choices = better to me.  Only having the choice to make a basic attack roll or run away is generally not terribly fun.  In this situation you end up with combat that is roll to hit, subtract some damage, move to next player, rinse and repeat.  YAWN.  SNORE.  Being able to make decisions that increase or decrease one's defensive and offensive capabilities from moment to moment based on the current situation is fun.  Burning Wheel does this well.  Fight! has a bunch of different options that are interesting and can help or harm your chances at success depending on how well you anticipate your enemy's strategy.  Strangely enough D&amp;D doesn't do this very well with most of the Fighter type characters but does do this with the Wizard, Sorcerer and other magic-wielding characters.  A wizard generally has more combat options open to his player than a fighter due to spell selection.  (Yes, level and refresh rate of spells and such have an affect here.  Not trying to get that complex at the moment.)<br/><br/>3.) Losing should be a result that doesn't end the game for the player.  This seems to be a no-brainer to me.  OD&amp;D handled this by making character generation so simple that a player that loses simply takes 10 minutes to make a new character and then joins right back in.  More hippy-style systems make losing not tied to character death and removal from play but rather tied to player intent for the combat.  Thus if the player loses his character is captured or humiliated or something but not necessarily removed from play.  Removal from play for any extended period blows.<br/><br/>Well, that's enough for the moment.  I'll let someone else talk for a bit.<br/><br/>~Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105680/#Comment_105680" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T10:01:15+00:00" title="October 31, 2007 10:01AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with James and Andrew both.

Looking at some other systems though, I can see mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuneQuest had decisions over when to parry. It had decisions of how much to delay to adjust hit location (and do you give up first strike to have lots of control over hit location). Of course everyone in RQ is a spell caster (I played 1st ed) so there are some tactical choices in spell use.<br/>\n<br/>\nCold Iron (a college friend's homebrew) had lots of tactical choices. It had a lot of the options that D&amp;D; 3.0 introduced, yet somehow they seemed less complex. There was also a lot of strategy and tactics in buying and using expendable magic items (and eventually permanent magic items).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to (A)D&amp;D;, I think there were a couple elements that factored in. One is that combats actually resolved pretty quickly. Another is that magic items were significant, but you had to (mostly) work with what you found (I did allow some amount of trading). But I think a lot of the fun comes from the strategy that leads up to the combat, which is fine if it takes a relatively short time to run a combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105732/#Comment_105732" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T13:01:31+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  1:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a very specific mechanic (ie a single magical item) the +4 Longsword of Defending is/was my favorite item in D&amp;D.

You've got your minis on a map or whatever, you know what they can do, you can see your opponent's stuff, you know what they can do. You have a big list of options, and you sit there for a few minutes, grinding through decision trees until you figure out the right choice as best you can. It's a lot like a chess game. You lose if you lack enough good options (the fighter problem in 3.X DnD) or play too fast. You can certainly play fast anyway, like Speed Chess, but the basic result is that inexperienced players lose that much faster.<br/><br/>A Yomi-based game allows much faster play, though the potential is not always realized. Anyway, I'd much rather my RPG combat feel like a round of Street Fighter than a game of chess, and the former is certainly a lot faster to play. Contenders is like this, with a choice/counter-choice game embedded in the stance selection. You have a rich play experience, but with a much smaller rule set: the opponent is providing the complexity, not the quantity of rules or the complexity of the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106227/#Comment_106227" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-02T09:43:04+00:00" title="November  2, 2007  9:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Anyway, I'd much rather my RPG combat feel like a round of Street Fighter than a game of chess, and the former is certainly a lot faster to play.</blockquote>\nYes!

In action-oriented games I like:<br/><br/>1) Meaningful tactics. Your choices matter. In some games this is very lo-fi (WoD, where the biggest choice is spending Willpower).or based on hardwired character traits (feats, class/character abilities). In action games I like there to be choices available to everyone, regardless of character build and for there to be multiple viable options.<br/><br/>2) The opposition's choices matter to you. *S/he* does meaningful stuff too and your choices plug right into his/hers, and vice versa. Being able to suss out how this will play can ive you a advantage based on reading your opponent.<br/><br/>3) There's plenty of room for narration. One of the limitations of a GURPS Martial Arts/Burning Wheel/TRoS approach is that your system choices do a lot of the narrative heavy lifting ahead of time. This is very useful for lots of people and I enjoy it from time to time myself, but n many cases I personally prefer to have specific actions done in broad strokes so that the player has the most room possible to plug in descriptions.<br/><br/>Ready 2 Run's combat system (the system used in Aeternal Legends) is designed for games with the above values. You build your own special moves round to round by spending Wits (which regenerates each round) and plugging them into your choice of single/multiple actions and defenses to make them better or worse based on what you think might happen during a particular phase. So your dice buffed opening move can be a downward blow or some kind of spiralling cut, or whatever -- you design the game characteristics of the move you want to do. From there we plug in Tricks and Preps, Expertise and special abilities, but all characters have options to pursue,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106559/#Comment_106559" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T13:37:25+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  1:37PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>It is surprisingly fantastic fun, even for doubters, once the scripting sheets are out.</blockquote><p>Not always.</p>\nDitto, it failed for us pretty spectacularly.

Watch how I soar" feeling during social interaction sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example in a Viking campaign the PCs are in the middle of a battle and an enemy shapeshifter has turned into an orca and is gnawing away at the bottom of the boat. I meant it to be a danger for the entire party but one of the PCs jumps into the freezing water by himself, distracts the orca with his pet walrus (don't ask) and has the walrus gets torn to pieces he is able to jam two spears deep into blubber behind the whale dorstal fin. Then the whale starts raging and doing everything to kill the PC while he draws weapon after weapon and drives each deep into the blubber. After a lot of Captain Ahab-style fun the PCs ends up standing on a dead whale, in the middle of the enemy fleet, with all of his weapons lodged in whale blubber and with a dozen Vikings about to throw spears at him, good times :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108128/#Comment_108128" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T13:48:09+00:00" title="November 13, 2007  1:48PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2007 1:51PM by buzz.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>Right, and this is where I'd really like to see some insights from folks.  What mechanical bits have you encountered in a game that made combat "fun"?

By eliminating various options people supposedly complain about (e.g., AoO's), combat got incredibly boring. E.g., since my PC didn't have to worry about getting into a flank, penalties for shooting into combat (iirc), or provoking an AoO for using a ranged weapon in a threatened square, our use of minis seemed pretty pointless. I was immediately obvious that walking up to a foe and popping a cap in his temple was the optimal strategy, as there was no risk. Damage in that system is also very random; you make a saving throw and your degree of failure determines the effect. It complicated resolution and made it difficult to gauge whether my PC needed to be cautious or not.<br/><br/>I think that, in an effort to be "more about the story," yet still be recognizably d20, the system basically achieved neither.<br/><br/>I dunno. I play a lot of D&amp;D 3.5, so maybe I've become biased. It can certainly get over-complicated sometimes, but I enjoy the tactical aspects. I like that while there may be optimal strategies, they aren't so obvious that play becomes repetitive and boring. Figuring out the optimal combos becomes part of the game. And positioning matters, so it's not just "walk up and roll to hit."<br/><br/>Like other people said, there should be a robust array of choices to be made, and those choices should matter. Realism needs to take a back seat to gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108202/#Comment_108202" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T03:24:15+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  3:24AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The second way to do this is to make the narration matter.

When I was working to turn Panty Explosion into a murder simulator I discovered that all I really wanted out of a fight was to be able to describe it. Everything else was secondary.When you get to describe how the butter knife slid into the soft skin around his eye, knowing that it also did 10 points of damage just doesn't matter. Even better, using that description as a platform to decide what happens next is just great. I succeed at stabbing you and "<i>The butter knife slides into the soft skin around his eye. He screams in pain and lurches out the door, into the snow. His brother screams curses at you and follows"</i>. That's the description of my dice roll. Now you roll your dice and we'll describe your action.
