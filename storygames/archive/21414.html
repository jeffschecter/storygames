(Most directly inspired by the fiction of Alastair Reynolds, but there's shades of Ursula K. Le Guin and classic Star Trek in there, too). It's been through a number of revisions with my local group, but I'd love to have more eyes on it.<br/><br/>The game is a diceless, GM-less system inspired by any number of storygames but probably most directly by Microscope, Downfall, Ben Lehman's Polaris, and Lovecraftesque. Players collaboratively create a House (a group of near-immortal galactic wanderers) and the values its members have sworn to live by. They then create characters who have their own personal values. Gameplay involves improvising a story together by asking successive questions, building towards a Dilemma, a big decision that puts two values in conflict. How the characters resolve the dilemma might change them and their relationship to their values in the next session.<br/><br/>Any feedback would be appreciated, but I'm especially interested in whether the rules read clearly, especially around building the Dilemma: and if anyone happens to run it, where the pain points were and what your overall experience was like. Thanks in advance! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="http://archivesofthesky.textories.com/pdfs/ArchivesOfTheSky10b.zip" rel="nofollow">Game and Handouts Link</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468724/#Comment_468724" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-06T22:13:09+00:00" title="January  6, 2018 10:13PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Archives of the Sky"?<br/><br/>Great title!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aaronareed" title="aaronareed"><img alt="aaronareed" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/966/nQYHV6FMT1122.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aaronareed">aaronareed</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468730/#Comment_468730" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-07T16:27:43+00:00" title="January  7, 2018  4:27PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (There's also a website <a href="http://archivesofthesky.textories.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> with a short example of play, to give a better sense of the game's flavor.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468735/#Comment_468735" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-07T19:53:31+00:00" title="January  7, 2018  7:53PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this at Go Play NW last year, it was one of my highlights of the convention.

I'll assume you do - let me know if I'm wrong - and include a few notes here:<br/><br/>* "Everyone should be thinking about how scenes are building towards a Dilemma between two Values"<br/><br/>This sentence, while correct, made me think that *each scene* should be building towards a Dilemma. Might be worth rephrasing, if you can avoid that implication.<br/><br/>* I was a little confused about the Roles and how they work in small groups. It sounds like everyone has a character to play, except for the Archivist (right?). But then, in any given scene, there is a Narrator, an Epic, and an Intimate, and, ideally, the people playing characters aren't any of those.<br/><br/>It might be good to include a few examples of how the Roles get assigned, particularly with smaller groups. Is the Archivist only distinct from other players in that they don't have a character?<br/><br/>* When you talk about constructing a Dilemma, sometimes you refer to placing a Value on the Dilemma sheet, and sometimes about "creating a Threat". <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, "creating a Threat" just means choosing a Value to be involved in the Dilemma. Is that right? If so, the text is confusing, because I kept looking for what the Threat was and what an example of one looks like. (Your term "threatened Value", used just before that bit, was clearer.)<br/><br/>Here, too, an example for illustration would really help! It's a little hard to imagine just from a read-through of the rules what it's supposed to look like.<br/><br/>* "Voting: Continue passing around the role of Narrator as before..."<br/><br/>This is a little confusing, too. How does this relate to "as before"? Earlier, we were playing out scenes, but now we're just voting. Does each "vote" or question act as a mini-scene, effectively?<br/><br/>An example and/or some orienting description for the reader would really help here.<br/><br/>* "The Archivist cannot vote"<br/><br/>What happens if you have three players, and all have a character? Wouldn't the Archivist's vote be necessary here?<br/><br/>* Flowchart/order of events<br/><br/>p. 12 has a really nice chart explaining how to play through a scene.<br/><br/>I think a similar chart explaining how to play through voting would be really helpful!<br/><br/>As described, it sounds like it's both very similar to playing a scene and yet, somehow, also quite different.<br/><br/>I also saw a typo somewhere (a missing verb, I believe), but I can't find it now, I'm afraid. (And it's not the one on the "summary of play" handout, which ends with the word "confl".) It wasn't that important, and it's notable that I only noticed one in the entire document - that shows a high attention to editing/proofreading.<br/><br/>Looks like a wonderful game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aaronareed" title="aaronareed"><img alt="aaronareed" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/966/nQYHV6FMT1122.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aaronareed">aaronareed</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468796/#Comment_468796" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-10T02:44:05+00:00" title="January 10, 2018  2:44AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul-- thanks so much for this feedback!
