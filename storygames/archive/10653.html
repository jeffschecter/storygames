I lost track of my IAWA games at 20 or so, but once again the game delivered a engaging, visceral chapter, and once again the fiction was dark and brilliant.  <br/><br/>We're going to play again in 2 weeks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236257/#Comment_236257" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T18:15:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  6:15PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love gaming with Paul!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236262/#Comment_236262" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T19:51:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  7:51PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeay!<br/><br/>That was interesting, and a very... different... game of IaWA.<br/><br/>For starters, all the PCs were children, although my child character was actually a devil--the soul of a stillborn child who was thrown off the alabaster tower.

his father (by trying to get them to love each other again) I got a bit freaked out - partially because, by establishing Baryamin as such a monster, it felt inevitable.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, that completely nailed the sort of Damian/Poltergeist/Sixth Sense angle, where the devil-boy doesn't <i>know </i>he's a devil-boy, doesn't realize he's hurting everyone.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few points, from Rob/Valvorik (player of the child/moon seer possessed by 10 rival spirits)<br/><br/>(a) The Sex and Sorcery book I gave Ryan at session coincidentally has the lines/veils concept for dealing with things like violence against kids and sexual violence etc. in setting parameters in play.  I'm a veil guy for most stuff (hey, I work for the Ministry in charge of film and video game rating in Ontario).  Which is to say I'm fine with (paraphrasing stuff in the Ron E's book), "we go into ally and have wild monkey sex with SM edge where she submits to me", but don't want an action by action narration of that at the level I'm okay with combat where "I punch him in face", "hah, no I duck his punch, grab his wrist and pull him off balance and to his knees" level of specificity.<br/><br/>(b) B~ being such a bastard in the fiction/Paul's playing of Aram. <br/><br/>Well villains need to do more than wear black, have moustaches and go "bwah hah hah". They can't all be plotting to end the world or other grandoise things. Sometimes they're just the local S.O.B. To me, B~ emerged as a character who the fiction "needs to deal with" in order to have narrative structure (e.g., we see whether he gets his comeuppance or not).  My play style for this sort of stuff is to have at least as much eye on "what is this story" as "who is my character".  In fiction, particularly TV/movies, there is often an early establishing scene "see just how bad this bad guy is".<br/><br/>First time I've met/played with Paul, I similarly put his in play actions down to, "well, he was playing a devil - it says "devil" not spirit, ghost, angel - what do you expect a devil's influence in a situation to result in, lollipops for everyone and people making good decisions?  The scene he evoked talking to his mother was creepy - presumably when your dead child you don't acknowledge comes back as a devil, creepy is an option.  That he finished off showing himself "more a fiend" physically while "a caring person at heart" creates an interesting dichotomy.  He was most fiendish when apparently a boy and most human when apparently a fiend.<br/><br/>(c) To Ryan, do you want any write up of the narrated stuff to track it. <br/><br/>In a wicked age, in the garden of the noble house of Midas, met the two children, the gardener's son, moon-watching Rab Seen, and the governess' daughter Cajun, wise beyond her years. On this night, Aram the devil child came to the house to seek his parents. On this night of the new moon, an alabaster tower arose unseen from the waters of the bay.<br/>....<br/>Cajun and her distraught mother fled using the money stolen from B~'s lock box as he lay unconscious and bloodied, his favourite cane broken nearby and the cook as witness to their flight.<br/><br/>Aram freed Rab Seen of his possessing spirits, which were dragged back down under the waves of the bay with the tower's descent. However, as Rab Seen tried to free Aram from the chains binding him to the tower as it bound the spirits, he did this only at cost of one re-entering him and creating such a chain between Rab Seen and Aram.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236465/#Comment_236465" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T18:39:22+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  6:39PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Rob!<br/><br/>It's nice to have a little summary like that. And I'm glad the character concept I was going for came across--I wanted to play a good little kid, but I felt I'd be cheating you all if I didn't stick to the "mischievous devil" part of the oracle description. Oddly enough, going in I'd been sure your character--the kid with 10 rival spirits inside his head--was going to be the creepy, scary one.<br/><br/>I think Kate spelled her character's name "Cajen", and she's up next on the Owe List, so it sure will be interesting to see what happens next.<br/><br/><br/>And John S,<br/><br/>You'll be happy to know I've already volunteered to run some Dogs, jenskot-style, for these fine folks.
