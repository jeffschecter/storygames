                    Hey everyone. This is my first post here. I found out about this place on the FATE yahoo group. I am fairly new to indie rpgs (have been reading up on it for about a year, but have had next to no chance to actually play most games), but love what i have found so far. My newest interest in indies has been GMless rpgs. I have already stumbled upon capes, but i was wondering if you guys could sugest any other GMless games that I could check out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Charles                </div>

Are there really many more than that? You also have "<b>Death's Door</b>" and "<b>It was a Mutual Decision</b>" and... I can't really think of many others, at least not ones that have been published.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I'm forgeting some, there still haven't been that many GM-less/GM-full games made.                        </div>

                            Hey. Thanks for the great responses.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Charles, what sort of thing interests you? Are there any particular genres or styles of game you like? What do you like about Capes?<br><br>Graham</br></br></blockquote>
Well, I am mostly into fantasy role playing, but like the occasional super hero, world of darkness style (though not the system), and modern games. I also tend to prefer story oriented games than the games that are rules heavy and emphasize "actor stance". <br><br>I really cant say a whole lot about capes. I haven't purchased it yet, but have read the capes lite rules, rlooked over the modules, and went through the capes flash demo. I like what i have read and seen, but cant say much more until i have actualy played it a bit. <br/><br/>I am currently most interested in story games that tend to give players more of the power and responsibility that was previously reserved for the gm in other systems. That probably explains my current interest in gmless games.<br/><br/>I am also making vain attempts at game design. I have been since 2002, with little to show for it. I just really needed, and still need, to check out more games. For example, I was trying to find a good way of handeling simultanios combat forever, only to discover that FATE already had a good setup in exchanged based combat (as well as other systems, but FATE was my first dose of indie rpgs).<br/><br/>Thanks again for the info!<br/><br/>Charles                        </br></br></div>

                            Ah...excellent. OK.<br/><br/>One thing to bear in mind is that many games, although they have a GM, give much more power to the players than is traditional. Dogs In The Vineyard is a good example.<br/><br/>If you're looking to check out lots of games for design ideas, I really recommend the www.1km1kt.com site. Look through some of the old Game Chef entries: it's a superb way of reading <i>lots</i> of games and working out what works and what doesn't. I remember, just before Christmas, I read through lots of Game Chef 2005 entries, and learnt a lot.<br/><br/>While you're there, check out Bacchanal, which is GM-less and, well, fascinating.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Personally, my favourite of these types of games is Universalis, because it literally can do everything, and do it <i>well</i>. I can't wait for the second edition. Want to do fantasy? Easy. SF? Easy. Superheroes? Easy.                        </div>

                            Hey man, welcome to the boards!  Also, I gotta say:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cjnodell</cite>Hey. Thanks for the great responses.<br/><br/>I am currently most interested in <b>story games</b> that tend to give players more of the power and responsibility that was previously reserved for the gm in other systems. That probably explains my current interest in gmless games.</blockquote>
This is kinda exciting: I picked the name "Story Games" as a lark, way back when in a discussion regarding how some folks on other message boards just have to draw the line between what is and isn't an RPG. I'm kinda happy to see that name take root, even though we (Clinton first) came up with the name off-handedly. :-)
<blockquote>I am also making vain attempts at game design. I have been since 2002, with little to show for it. I just really needed, and still need, to check out more games.

Rock on, dude.  Yeah, I'm still "working on a Sorcerer supplement" that I started in 200-fucking-1. For me, it's not so much "must check out more games", as "must get off my lazy ass, sit down and frigging write, dammit!".  Most of my recent work has been jumping between three in-process games of sorts. What really helped me get going was participating in my own <a href="http://www.24hourrpg.com" rel="nofollow">24 Hour RPG Project</a>, which worked great.  I got some groovy ideas, and the foundation of a solid game that I'm about a third done writing.  Anyway, good luck with your stuff.<br/><br/>Also, it's not GM-less, but have you seen The Shadow of Yesterday?  If you like FATE, there are parts of this game (it's available free on the internet as well as purchasable in a nicely laid-out form) that are really worth getting into if you're a fan of Fudge: Namely "Bringing Down the Pain", and how it seamlessly moves, gestalt-fashion, between blow-by-blow conflict resolution and "one roll for the whole conflict" conflict resolution (from the original Fudge docs).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

I had no idea how to add to the discussion otherwise, so I simply created this new discussion so that i could continue, as well as a way to tell you guys that the oll discussion was messed up.<br/><br/>Anyways, I have already checked out The Shadows of Yesterday, and love it. It is on the top of my list of games to play once i get back to america. In the mean time, I keep reading it over and over again to get a better understanding of the concepts. In fact, together with Fate, Pace and The Pool it is one of my main sources of insperation for my current rpg design effort.<br/><br/>Charles</blockquote> </div>

                            It's worth noting that there are two types of GMless games.  One type, like Capes, Universalis, or The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach, gives all players the exact same role.  Another type, like Polaris, Shock:, and Breaking the Ice, splits up power differently between different players, but does it along non-traditional lines (the guide in Breaking the Ice is a rotating role that is really nothing like a GM, but very different from the active player as well.)<br/><br/>You may well be interested in both of these, though...<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

I would have to say that games like Capes, Universalis, or The Shab-Al-Hiri Roach tend to peak my interest a bit more at the moment, but I will defenialty be looking into all the others in time. I kind of like the competive, player against player, feel i got from capes. <br/><br/>It kind of makes sense that it is either a rotating authoritive figure (wont use the term gm as you have pointed out that this figures role varies from that of the typical gm), or a complete dispersal of gm power among all players in a way that gives everyone the same role. I am definatily excited to see the various ways in which this is done. I seem to be getting the impression that a lot of people are taking an interest in gmless design, so i hope that there will soon be even more gmless games to check out<br/><br/>Charles                        </div>

                            Both of the games I've posted online -- <em><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/01/the_court_of_th.html" rel="nofollow">The Court of the Empress</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a></em> are "GM-less", though I've never thought of them in that light before. It seems like an odd way to classify a game -- the games in this thread vary wildly in style and the kind of play they support. But I guess that's a feature!                        </div>

                            Well, it's like saying you want a car with a V8. You're not specifying horsepower, revs, or power:weight, but you know it'll be kind of a big engine. It also doesn't tell you much. But since a V8 will cost tens of thousands of dollars and a GMless RPG will cost you tens of ones of dollars, the experimentation is liable to be more cost-effective.<br/>
<br/>
The games I've written so far have had a particular distribution of responsibilities: in Under the Bed, the player who won the last conflict sets up the next conflict because it tends to encourage an escalation of gnarl. In Shock: the player to your left plays your Antagonist. That way, you develop an intimate relationship with them and can easily read each others' notes.<br/>
<br/>
These are two of my attempts at eliminating the conflict of interest that a GM faces in an older game structure. Other designers do it different ways; Vincent strictly outlines the responsibilities of the GM in Dogs, for instance, as establishing situation and playing opposition in order to push the players toward making a decision. Tim does the same in The Mountain Witch by distributing scene framing responsibilities and putting the dynamics in the hands of the Trust mechanic. Matt strips almost everything away from the GM in Prime Time Adventures, leaving only the initial scene and opposition in the form of a Budget.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I like to distribute it widely. Lots of GM stuff is fun and I like everyone to share that fun; plus, protagonist stuff is fun, and it's a drag to not have one when you're GM (because having one constitutes a conflict of interest).                        </div>

Err, I've designed a couple of GMless RPGs.<br/>
<br/>
The Ronny award winning <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/contenders.htm" rel="nofollow">Contenders</a> and the non-Ronny award winning <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/dragon&amp;Gun.htm" rel="nofollow">The Dragon vs The Gun</a><br/>
There are pdf versions of them both available for free if you're interested. Print version of Contenders is due for launch at Indy GenCon.<br/>
