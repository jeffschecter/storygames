Being creative IS gaming, gaming IS being creative. <br/><br/>So the more you do it, the better you get at it. 100%<br/><br/>As for my own experiences with this... gaming is a creative activity that I can pursue that helps me think differently about creating stuff than making jewelry does (my current art form of choice). It leads me to research facts for my game, create personalities for my PCs and NPCs, find colorful pictures that best describe my world, and get together with a group of friends and basically bounce around awesome creative ideas with each other for hours, generating really interesting stories and a fun time had by all. This is pure magic for my creative brain. All this creative juice then basically causes a domino effect with my art making, so I can bounce back and forth between the two, using that voodoo research I did for my WOD game to effect ideas about ritual artifacts and designs that I employ in my newest necklace, or the story we told in our IAWA game that allowed me to think better on my toes and create freeform lists of ideas for projects in the future, or to utilize some research I just did about Ancient Greece for my jewelry to influence the mythology I'm creating in my Farscape game.<br/><br/>Pure creative gold, gaming is.

My sister who is a 4th grade teacher suggested that I include the line about creativity. She uses "simulations", which are essentially RPGs to stimulate creativity in her students. It's a fairly accepted method of stimulating creativity in schools. Businesses use it to! I'd argue, I'm way more creative because of RPGs. And I have been very successful in business because of that creativity. I think presenting games from these perspectives can possibly help attract non gamer adults, parents, and business people. <br/><br/>And when I attended art school, we also used exercises similar to RPGs to stimulate creativity. <br/><br/>Creativity is not the same thing as innate talent. Creativity is something you can exercise. It's not that different than strategic thinking or socializing. And those are accepted areas where gaming can help you grow. <br/><br/>That being said, Ron brought up a good point. Even if gaming can help you be more creative, that doesn't mean that is the best way to present gaming to new people. Presenting it as a fun creative outlet may be more attractive. It's definitely food for thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222263/#Comment_222263" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T13:16:15+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  1:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think role-playing games absolutely help people be more creative.<br/><br/>For example, I'm a big fan of 'In A Wicked Age' - a game that require the players to create characters, settings, imaginary histories, and so on. I have never once failed to be amazed at how funny and inventive people can be when given a framework in which to do so, even (or especially) people who don't normally play RPGs.<br/><br/>As to the question of whether such games are just bringing out existing creativity, I don't think its a meaningful distinction. If I play a game and help invent a civilization of fungus-people and their dying violet empress, I am being creative, and I wouldn't have done that if I weren't playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222268/#Comment_222268" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T13:27:14+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  1:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><br/>It's a weird "argument," since the improvement can only be measure by the efforts seen -- so, are you getting better at being creative, or getting better at expressing creativity?

It also allows you to express you creativity in the act of gaming.<br/><br/>I'm not a follower of the school of thought that Art (being used also synonymously with Creativity in this sense) is something that you're born with or not. Everyone can learn Art, and everyone can learn to be Creative... its part of being human. So, I guess I kinda disagree overall with the discussion that people CAN'T be creative at all. Creativity is something we all have that needs to be nurtured and brought out through various modes of expression. Gaming is one of these modes, just like drawing is. The act of doing "creativity" helps you learn and express at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222276/#Comment_222276" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T13:40:07+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  1:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, just as much as anything else could.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222289/#Comment_222289" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T14:48:27+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  2:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also agree with Anansigirl.<br/><br/>When I "won" NaNoWriMo this past November, it was only because I'd spent the previous year playing a ton of Primetime Adventures and learning how to play and run games that were different from the games I played as a kid.

What's important is that you and your friends are <i>telling</i> a story together. It's the act of creation that's the focus, not the finished product. Consider this: there have been plenty of "how do we make our game more fun" threads on S-G, but when was the last time you saw a "how do we make our stories better" thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222295/#Comment_222295" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T15:28:15+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  3:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite><br/>Maybe it's because my main creative outlet is music, but I think there's a big difference between creativity and practice.

I teach guitar for a living, and have spend most of my adult life studying jazz. I practice improvisation by focusing certain areas, by giving myself constraints, and the being creative within those limits.<br/><br/>For instance, I might improvise over a jazz standard using only major 7 arpeggios superimposed over a different harmony and only allow myself to play 5-note phrases.<br/><br/>I teach my students the same method. They're learning the basics of chord substitution, they're learning arpeggio fingerings, some of them are learning their notes beyond the root of the chord (this IS guitar), and at the same time -- they're making music that hasn't been heard before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222296/#Comment_222296" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T15:28:53+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  3:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron,<br/><br/>I get where you're coming from.  It's one of the reason's I'm a big proponent of the idea of practicing individual games.  There is no "GMing" skill set.  Even better there is no "Story Games GMing" skill set.  GMing Sorcerer is not the same as GMing Primetime Adventures, is not the same as GMing My Life with Master, is not the same as GMing Dogs in the Vineyard.  Sure, there are some overlap but the there are some pretty unique demands from each of those games and if you try to apply just the overlap skills in a generic way the game will be a weak watery version of what the game is supposed to be like.<br/><br/>So yeah, when I play Sorcerer, I'm getting better at Sorcerer.  I'm not getting better at being a writer (even though there may be some overlap skills).<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222318/#Comment_222318" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T18:09:49+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  6:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>More importantly, when I<i>play</i>a song (as opposed to practicing a song) I am<i>not</i>doing so in order to get better at music, I'm doing it for the sheer joy of<i>making</i>music, right then and right there.</blockquote>\nBut (to pick up the analogy) you *are* getting better at music, even though that isn't your goal in playing the song. When I play The Mountain Witch tomorrow, I won't be doing so to hone my creativity, or to master the rules, but I will be doing those things all the same.<br/><br/>And, to merge this with Jesse's comment, the more you play guitar, the better you get at *music* in general. So if you picked up a brand-new instrument, let's say the hammered dulcimer, you'd be better at it than someone completely untrained in music, once you got your bearings. Because you have spent time with the general principles, even if there is a new set of techniques you need to learn to apply those principles.<br/><br/>[Insert sound of analogy stretched too thin to support weight]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222327/#Comment_222327" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T20:18:14+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  8:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2009 8:20PM by ccreitz.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neal Stephenson</cite>"Star means a master of conventional [media], which are precisely the technology we are trying to move beyond," said Mr. Beck, a bit scornful that she wasn't getting it.<br/><br/>Mr. Oda pointed to the band.

The headliners \u2014 I want to say it was the Bouncing Souls, but my memory could be failing me \u2014 set up on the floor instead of the stage.

Gaming is synthesis practice.  Improvement may be incidental, if you're just playing and not targeting any skills for improvement, but it'll happen.<br/><br/>That synthesizer needs good raw material, though.  You gotta keep feeding that brain. <br/><br/>When I was writing fiction, I met people who had never done anything but write and read in their chosen genre.  Their manuscripts had a very distinctive stank to them.  They might have been expert reassemblers but for materials they had only bubblewrap and dialtone.<br/><br/>So yeah.

We're still living in a post-post-modern world, one that turns Picassos into rock stars and overexaggerates the romantic ideal of the artist that has been around since just after the Renaissance. The ideal that god or some magical thing inspires creativity and art, and that's where it comes from only for the elect, elite, or special individual. These ideas are so outdated! Art can be taught, and so can creativity. It doesn't even need to be, really, because that's something we all have.<br/><br/>It's so weird that this is even a controversial idea. But, I see examples of that every day. I guess not everyone lives in the midst of that much obvious creativity, nor makes it their life pursuit. I dunno, if gaming wasn't creative and didn't help my creativity grow, I'd dump it like an abusive boyfriend that demanded too much of my attention and didn't pay rent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222963/#Comment_222963" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T09:17:58+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  9:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2009 9:23AM by Burr.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't expressed, you haven't created.

Have you read Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi? He is one of the most famous scholars in the field of creativity. He wrote the "Flow" books, in which he expresses a similar idea: that creativity only exists externally, in the way that it impacts society, and that therefore it is society which judges whether or not an individual/work is creative. His focus, therefore, is on "Big C" creativity, or people who make a major impact on the world of idea.<br><br>It seems to me that the effects of personal creativity are pervasive and impossible to track. If I live a creative life, even just internally, that will implicitly change how I think, how I speak, how I act, how I vote. It will change the way I interact with others even when I'm not engaging in explicitly creative pursuits. If I "create myself", the results of my changes may have profound effects on the world. It is not difficult to imagine a butterfly-effect type of phenomenon rippling out from such personal creativity. This is not particularly a solution for me, as I am an externally creative person as well as an internally creative person, but this does apply to, for instance, my father. His life and those of his family has been greatly improved by his embrace of internal creativity as he's gotten older, even though he still lacks the skill and confidence to create external product.<br><br>That being said, the book "Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery of Invention was profoundly personally meaningful to me and I highly recommend it to creators of all kinds.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_223027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223027/#Comment_223027" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T13:03:33+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  1:03PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Mainstream western culture has allowed their creative muscle to atrophe to the point where its hardly accessible to them anymore and thus displays of creativity seem magical or wonderous.</blockquote>\nI apologize for the derail, but whenever I hear romantic sentimentality like this, my knee jerks hard.

I can think of several other activitities besides gaming that does the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most people I know outside of my gamer friends don't engage in any of those activities.
