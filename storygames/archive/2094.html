                    READ DOWN TO SEE INFO ABOUT PTA ONLINE GENERALLY, THE FIRST FEW POSTS WERE BRAINSTORMING FOR A PARTICULAR SHOW.<br/><br/>The FoundryTV production of "Curtains" has been greenlighted by Showtime. This show is tentatively described as a "struggling theater company production in a haunted theater". In this thread, the writers, actors, producers and directors of "Curtains" meet to discuss locations, characters, and technical details.<br/><br/>My first question for you Writers' Guild-card-waving pencilnecks is this: having never used Primetime Adventures for a troupe game where people might be coming and going throughout the season, how should Screen Presence be handled? Should it default to 1 or 2 or just whatever people decide on in the moment?<br/><br/>Should the unit of "Curtains" play be a scene or an episode? I'm thinking episode, but how can we handle season length when some people might be in 12 episodes and others in 3?                </div>

                            Let's talk about ghosts, too. Are the ghosts visible? If so, what do they look like? In other words do we have low-budget makeup-and-odd-costume ghosts or cgi ghosts or what? Also, how do they interact with the living, can they talk or is it just visions? <br/><br/>We had a pretty strong veto of "casual" ghosts in the sense of the Buffyverse, they are supposed to be creepy, that's a good starting place.<br/><br/>What are the ghosts after, can they be placated/exorcised/dispersed or no?<br/><br/>I'm seeing this primarily as a magical-realism show where magic is unusual and frightening to the characters but also naturalistic in its own way. (A basic magical realism article which is only useful if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, if you do, don't click: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism</a> )                        </div>

                            Obviously we will have to secure a theater, or build one on the lot. What other sets or locations should I be sending out scouts for? Apartments for some of the characters, certainly...maybe an agent's office or the local coffeeshop/hangout?                        </div>

                            RISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.<br/><br/>I have given some more thought to this project as well as to online PTA play in general.<br/><br/>Is anyone still interested in "Curtains"? As you can see from the above, interest was rather, ah, slight.<br/><br/>There was some discussion in a hatin'-on-Star-Wars thread (fie! fie!) that we might produce a PTA series that revised the prequels.  I am interested in Producing this too. You must understand that as a Producer I have a huge amount of money and if I don't get it into a production soon the IRS will take it all away.<br/><br/>I am going to either start a new discussion about an online PTA play model or post my ideas in this discussion.<br/><br/>Anyway, anyone still interested or who is becoming interested, pooooost.                        </div>

                            MY PROPOSAL FOR ONLINE PRIMETIME ADVENTURES PLAY<br/>By Me, JDCorley<br/><br/>REALITY<br/><br/>Now I know working in television means reality is our enemy.  But let's face at least one fact:<br/><br/>FACT NUMBER 1.  People are going to be logging on and off and playing this at weird times.  We want them to be able to create scenes and episodes at any time of the day or night because they probably live in some Marrakech slum or Detroit penthouse. Fucking writers.  Anyway, the point is that there will be only a weak correlation between characters and situations available for any given scene.  That correlation will be based on the physical location of the contributors - everyone on the East Coast of the US might be wanting to play at one time, two hours later the West Coast folks will be getting home and ready to gear up.<br/><br/>That to me says that we should take the standard requirement of 'everyone is here and the Producer is here so we can play' out behind the shed and put one behind its ear. <i>Just like I did when I cancelled Firefly.</i>  Now that we have done that, this opens up some options:<br/><br/>-- Play on the Foundry or on Skype or on IRC or on a wiki or in a play-by-post format can all be accomodated equally well.<br/>-- Those hippies that like to have lots of different characters and play this one or that one depending on what message they want to send in the Hallmark Special that they've got in their heads can do that and they won't fuck anything up or go over budget or anything.<br/><br/>It also creates some requirements:<br/><br/>-- We are going to have to document everything to be sure that there's no continuity screw-ups that the Internet nerds can fuck us with. The good news is that wiki and forum space is accessible to everyone and free.  Everyone will have to commit to reading up before they play and reporting after they play, we're not all going to be around at the same time.<br/>-- There will have to be someone making decisions, the large number of different writers/actors and even (gulp!) producers of independent episodes require that someone be able to nail down what is true and what is not true. <i>That will be me, I control your world now.</i><br/>-- We will have to do something about the budget/fan-mail/Screen Presence ecosystem. That is the subject of my next memo.                        </div>

                            SCREEN PRESENCE/BUDGET/FANMAIL Proposal<br/><br/>There are several options for people who want to play this game.<br/><br/>The first and most preferable is an <i>analogue of tabletop play</i> in which there is a Producer and several participants.  This can take place over Skype, IRC, or on the Foundry. (You DO know how to get on the Foundry, right? ) In these episodes, players could select the Screen Presence of their characters as being 1-3.  You can only set your Screen Presence to 3 once per season and only with the consent of the Producer handling the episode.  Fan mail and budget work normally in these episodes.<br/><br/>The second method is <i>playing a single scene or series of scenes without a full episode</i>.  There need be no formal Producer for these scenes, and they can take place whenever two or more players are around.  The budget for each scene is 1, which is automatically spent on any Conflict.  The participants in a scene have to agree on both sides of the conflict.  (Thus, if you have a strong opinion on the way that a scene should come out, you should volunteer to be a Producer of a full episode surrounding the scene!)  The purpose of these scenes is primarily to develop character and expand situations. Maybe even to provide some of that exposition that the kids today are so excited about.  All participants in these scenes have a Screen Presence of 1.<br/><br/>The third method is <i>creating a scene through non-budget collaboration</i> via a wiki or forum posts.  All collaborative methods not related to the budget fall under this third method.  You don't have a screen presence, no participant in these scenes do.  The Big Shot Producer in charge of everything (<i>me, remember, it's me</i>) can give you up to 1 fan mail per scene if it's a fucking cool scene or he might not if you suck or he forgets to or if it's Thursday.<br/><br/>The person who creates a report of a scene or episode and posts it to the wiki space gets 1 fan mail from nowhere for doing so. <i>From fucking nowhere, it doesn't cost me a fucking dime, do you understand?</i><br/><br/>Fan mail attaches to players, not to characters.  However, only one of your characters can have a spotlight episode in a season.  So if you want to have six thousand supporting characters who never go above Screen Presence 1 and one who is more important, go right ahead.<br/><br/>The season is over when the Big Shot Producer says it's over.  This will be announced some time in advance so that people can get in their spotlight episodes in.<br/><br/>I am interested in critiques and ideas re: this method not only for this project but for future projects.                        </div>

                            I'm up for this, whether with Curtains or something else. I have no shortage of ideas for TV shows. I think the resource framework in place is good enough to start with, though it might be good to state explicitly how spending (and handing out) fanmail works for Scene Type <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, which is still engaged with some sort of budget. (Does that 1-cost conflict come out of a seasonal/episode budget, or just out of thin air as well?)                        </div>

                            Ooh, definitely Landon. I'd like to see what you've got. Hardcoded cards and fanmail would be great.<br/><br/>Reading over my proposal I don't think there's really a difference between scene type 2 and scene type 3 except that type 2 is where someone in a type 3 scene said 'hey, we found a Conflict! Let's use the system to resolve it!'  Next draft will collapse these two scene types together.<br/><br/>The 1-chip conflict Budget in non-episode based scenes comes out of thin air.<br/><br/>Really I want to encourage the use of the episode and standard budget structure but we have to take into account the possibility that a goodly number of scenes will just involve a couple of people logging in and their characters have a conversation and nobody will want to Produce an episode.<br/><br/>Also, this ain't goin' to work with just the three of us - or more precisely, if we do that we should just do a 3-person PTA game and not worry about the Massively Multiplayer proposal. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

                            Foundry has at least one Deck of Cards code-object, that could be ported elsewhere assuming compatible codebases. Though personally I think just doing it at the Foundry would be cool.<br/><br/>I feel like if we start up a game with 3-5 core players, the massively multiplayer rules will be nice to have for people who want to jump in to the occasional scene or episode, or are willing to commit to playing bit parts and the like. After all, nobody wants to be on a show until it makes it to mid-season -- that's when you start scheduling all the big cameos.                        </div>

                            I went back and reread the "fie, fie on Star Wars" thread to dig out how we want to be revisionist.<br/><br/>It seems to me that there are two major plot arcs that have to be accomplished to get to A New Hope:<br/><br/>The Empire has to rise (and the Rebellion must be formed - by the time Luke gets to it, it is a going concern.)<br/><br/>The Jedi have to fall and be more or less wiped out. (I'm not committed to everything Kenobi telling Luke being one hundred percent accurate or truthful, but they should <i>not</i> be a going concern.)<br/><br/>Everything else is on the chopping block.<br/><br/>Interestingly, to me, these two arcs, while related, don't seem to be inextricable. The first seems like it could be a political drama and the second a mystic one.<br/><br/>Thus I propose we make this a "large ensemble" show like a soap opera, although it would still be in the standard PTA format. Each episode could advance both the individual stories of the characters and the larger aspect of the Galaxy and where it's at, though not necessarily always strictly in order.<br/><br/>As you know from my participation in the other thread, I'm pretty enthused about the idea of showing (not telling) that the Empire is bad and that it is destroying something good. So for the rise-of-the-Empire bit, here's a proposal:<br/><br/>We portray the Republic as having very positive ideals and doing <i>some</i> good, with the implication that it used to do much more. However, corruption and bureaucracy impede everything it tries to do, even legitimate things.  The populace at large is tired of the bribes and delays that accompany every aspect of public life, although they'll all enthusedly support 'The Republic' as an entity and will (mostly) accurately reminisce about when the Republic actually seemed to be working, they want a change. There are two upstart factions that offer this change: one, led by Palpatine, supports "centralization of authority" as a cure, another reformer group (led by who?) supports "systematic reform" which would send tons of beings to jail.  The latter is much more expensive and their outfits aren't as cool.  Neither faction, at the outset, seems to have much chance against the entrenched elites. There should even be temptations and difficulties involved in these two factions working together or being confused for one another.<br/><br/>Maybe two brothers, one of whom is a Senator, support different 'reform' factions, and then we get some of that good Star Wars family drama too.<br/><br/>This is just a start, it needs a good injection of running around shooting things and punching bad guys.<br/><br/>Post more Star Wars revision thoughts here whilst I work on the wiki.                        </div>

                            Free time? Ha! But 7pm Arizona time is 8pm Eastern (I think...), which might be manageable for me, depending on the day of the week, of course.<br/><br/>The political is personal, and the personal political -- at least, they are in an engaging story. And remember this is ultimately the story of Anakin Skywalker and his family, in which the Republic and Empire exist only to provide a supercharged version of the "pathetic fallacy" by which the external, nonhuman environment manifests internal, human emotions. Thus, in a story set in the real world, when the protagonist feels like crying, it rains, and when she's angry, there's thunder and lightning; in a story set in a fantastical world, when the protagonist feels loss, civilization falls, and when the protagonist feels anger, he gets into a laser sword fight atop exploding lava.<br/><br/>The bottom line: The Republic, the Rebellion, the Empire, the Jedi Order, and everything else in the Star Wars galaxy exist ONLY to provide emphasis or contrast for the Skywalker family's personal conflicts.<br/><br/>I'd propose that what's wrong with the Republic and the Jedi Order, at the most basic level, be the same thing that's wrong with the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan: There is an ancient set of traditions, time-tested and full of goodness, that have become constricting and repressive, breeding conflict between the established order and innovative newcomers, between those who want to preserve and pass on the good that was and those who want to find new expressions of goodness, between fathers and sons, between teachers and students. I'd propose, further, that the Republic and the Jedi Order need to be destroyed, if only by thoroughgoing reform, just as children ultimately need to break from their parents and metaphorically "kill" them.<br/><br/>Of the elements on the prequel movies, I'd like to keep and salvage the idea of the Jedi Order as monastic and celibate -- maybe even the idea that they are essentially Janissaries, much of whose "recruiting" involves separating young children from their parents. This fits well with the whole "Light vs. Dark" dichotomy in the classic films and, especially, the characters of Yoda, and to a lesser extent Kenobi, in the classics: solitary, utterly unconcerned with display, minimally concerned with physical comfort, deeply distrustful of any strong emotion be it anger or love, without any family or friends of their own and willing to counsel Luke to sacrifice his friends. We know they failed with Anakin, and I can imagine why: As Obi-Wan implies in the original <i>Star Wars</i> with his praise of Luke's father, Anakin was already a young man, not a malleable child, whom Obi-Wan decided to train in the Force himself, without Yoda's supervision (as implied in <i>Empire</i>), because of the great emergency of the Clone Wars and Anakin's great talent.<br/><br/>What the Clone Wars are, I don't know yet. Some kind of civil war or slave revolt within the Republic rather than an external threat, clearly, given that the story is about conflict between Anakin and his father-figure (Obi-Wan) and surrogate family (the Jedi), rather than "us versus them."<br/><br/>I'm also remembering the scene in the first <i>Star Wars</i> where Tarkin announces the Senate has been dissolved, and the immediate response of his council -- who, like all Imperial leadership in the films, are not merely majority-human but 100% white human male -- is, how can we maintain control without the bureaucracy? To which Tarkin's answer is that the regional governors will be given absolute power in their territories.<br/><br/>That implies to me that Palpatine is <i>not</i> a centralizer at all: Quite the contrary, he's dismantling the established central bureaucracy of the Republic -- note "the bureaucracy" and "the Senate" seem to be synonymous! -- in favor of a system that gives regional strongmen free rein, restricted not by formal oversight and regulations but by roving hatchetmen given even greater independence. Darth Vader is such a troubleshooter, apparently, and the entire idea of a Death Star is the "do what I want or I'll choke you to death" philosophy of management on a grand scale. I suspect that, like Hitler's Reich, the Empire <i>looks</i> rigidly organized but is in practice a chaos of competing fiefdoms.<br/><br/>So moving backwards in time, I'd suggest that Palpatine is the reform-minded advocate of decentralization, the spokesman of a rising new class of provincial potentates -- wealthy and well-armed merchant princes, perhaps, with private armies to protect their interests amidst the growing lawlessness -- who have found a way to prosper as the Republic declines but who are chafing against the remaining restrictions. I'd further suggest that the provincial newcomers are human and that the traditional central government is dominated by aliens.<br/><br/>Palpatine thus stands politically as the advocate of the Galaxy tearing off the restraints of the past to allow a new breed of bold, assertive men to take power and Do What Must Be Done -- and personally, as the advocate of Anakin tearing off the restraints of his Jedi teachers and allowing his passions to give him power to Do What Must Be Done.<br/><br/>Anyone surprised that I'd love to play Palpatine? A relatively young, charismatic, crusading, reformist, passionate Palpatine? I don't even think he's necessarily a Sith yet -- that may come later as he becomes increasingly frustrated with the obstructionism of the Jedi and seeks to fight them on their own terms.                        </div>

                            That seems reasonable to me, especially about where Palpatine intends the power to actually go, and the Kenobi/Palpatine rivalry. What I see as interesting about the rivalry is that Palpatine (in this recasting) is primarily political and Kenobi is primarily mystic. Different worlds. Maybe one reason Palpatine seems so tempting is because he offers a doorway into a world of luxury and all Kenobi has is a bowl and a blanket and a bathrobe. Even if Palpatine is willing to eschew 90 percent of the overblown opulence of the rest of the Senate, he still can snap his fingers and the girls come a running. When you're fifteen that means you're god. Why am I hearing the Godfather theme?<br/><br/>How did Palpatine get from being a fascist political reformer to a Sith Lord? The existing movies cop out and say he always was. But what if he had to cut a deal to get what he wanted and the extermination of the Jedi was the cost?<br/><br/>I disagree a little that the whole thing can be set as an allegory/parallel of family dynamics. Tarkin for the bad guys and Solo for the good guys and Lando for the rest keep the feet of the original trilogy narrative on the ground - without anyone remotely approaching their position in the prequels, it floated away into the cgi-generated ether. But, same token, if we don't at least have SOME of that family hoohah stuff, yeah, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Remember, folks, Arizona has no daylight savings, so take that into account in your calculations.                        </div>

                            Oh, you're right about grounding. You need strong characters who aren't caught up in the family dynamic -- the Tarkins and Landos, and even Han at first -- to avoid turning it into incestuous soap opera, where a whole bunch of overheated people emote at each other in a bubble isolated from any kind of real world.<br/><br/>&gt; Maybe one reason Palpatine seems so tempting is because he offers a doorway into a world of luxury and all Kenobi has is a bowl and a blanket and a bathrobe....he still can snap his fingers and the girls come a running.

                            Darn it, now you've infected my brain. I have a deadline at work, you know.<br/><br/>Excerpt from PROCEEDINGS OF THE GALACTIC SENATE, 11453rd SESSION, DAY 122<br/>(Transcript courtesy of G-SPAN)<br/><br/>SPEAKER: The Senator from Far Nilahn has the floor.<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE: Thank you, my lord Speaker. And thank you, also, to my distinguished colleague for the intriguing suggestion that my constituents should have, and I quote, "simply waited for the Jedi instead of preempting them." Quite so, my friends, quite so. And that is precisely what my constituents in fact did, for six weeks -- six weeks! -- while the pirates of this so-called Calrissian Corporation....<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED: Slander! Slander!<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE (continuing): ... I say again, while the pirates of this so-called Calrissian Corporation preyed with impunity upon peaceful shipping and upon peaceful citizens of the Republic. Six weeks, while Amalgamated Tarkin simply waited for action upon its reasonable requests, while this distinguished body referred the matter from one subcommittee to the next, while the bureaucracy memorandized and the Jedi Council meditated....<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED: Blasphemer!<br/><br/>SPEAKER: We will have order!<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE (shouting): ....while the Calrissian pirates....<br/><br/>{CROSS TALK, INAUDIBLE}<br/><br/>SPEAKER: Order! Order!<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE: Four hundred dead! Eighteen freighters taken or destroyed! Four hundred billion in damages! And the lives and livelihood of hundreds of billions of citizens endangered by the disruption in trade -- endangered until Amalgamated Tarkin's private security forces took action in the public interest!<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED: Private armies! Private war!<br/><br/>SPEAKER: Order!<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE: I would have advised Chairman Tarkin to write off the costs of defending the public against Calrissian as a tax deduction.<br/><br/>{LAUGHTER, BOOS}<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE: Yet when the Jedi finally arrived, who should they arrest? Citizen Tarkin!<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED: Butcher Tarkin!<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE: My friends, some say this great Republic is in decline. But I say -- no! Not as long as public-spiritied citizens volunteer their own resources...<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED: Private armies!<br/><br/>SENATOR PALPATINE: ...to defend her! To defend her, I say, and to expand her: For while we sit here on Coruscant sadly speaking of decline, private enterprises like Tarkin Amalgamated are busy making this Republic grow -- yes, and making new revenues flow towards the Senate, taxes for which they receive precious little in return. My friends, it may be that the bureaucracy is in decline. It may be that this august assembly is in decline.

                            I have completed a template for PTA characters on the wiki.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Inspector_Hiiyimna" rel="nofollow">Sample character</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Template:FoundryTVChar" rel="nofollow">Template with instructions.</a><br/><br/>Note that if you are more adept with templates than I am, please fuck around with it to make it better. Like...columns would be nice.<br/><br/>Next step is getting some specific production decisions down about each show (there is still interest in "Curtains" on the Foundry although few have talked/brainstormed about it here).<br/><br/>Let's get some specifics, narrow some shit down.                        </div>

                            Okay, I wrote this once already then accidentally deleted it, so this version will lack the compelling polish of the original pitches.<br/><br/>Short version is: Star Wars makes me yawn, why do I want to spend effort fixing what George Lucas broke? Fuck that guy. We need new shows!<br/><br/>So here's three pitches:<br/><br/><b>Curtains!</b><br/>An amateur theatre company has somehow inherited <i>The Excelsior</i>, a once-hallowed playhouse long-since collapsed under the weight of its name, and haunted by the ghosts of past tragedies and productions. Can this collection of ex- and semi-professionals, white-collar amateurs, alchoholic drama nerds and starry-eyed ingenues put together a successful show and restore the theatre to its former glory? Or will their efforts come to ruin, dragged down by the shadows and detritus of the past? And what of the theatre itself -- how will the company fare when the frayed curtain between the living and the dead begins to pull back?<br/><br/><b>Themes:</b> Personal drama, ghosts, life and death, community and art, why would anyone want to be in an amateur theatre production anyways?<br/><b>Tone:</b> Drama and dark humour. Dead Like Me with the seriousness turned up several notches. Ghosts are emotional manifestations, not independant 'people' -- supernatural encounters are harrowing and unexpected, and their purpose is to emphasize and illuminate the struggles of the cast. <br/><b>Possible types:</b> The bitter, burnt-out director; the motherly stage manager; the ambivalent (business v. art) producer; the rehab-prone Hollywood B-list; the overtalented ingenue; the sleeps-with-everyone bit-parter; the creepy stage-hand; the new-age make-up artist; the washed-up stage veteran; the eager professional with no idea what he's getting into.<br/><br/><b>The River</b><br/>In the shadow of a long-abandoned industrial suburb, a collection of misfits, outcasts, criminals and wanderers makes their home along a stretch of water -- "The River," famous for its suicides, itself a constant presence in the lives of those it intersects. Houseboats, scrap-heap hovels, hollowed-out refrigerators and wheel-less schoolbuses dot the landscape. These are desperate, lonely people who have somehow -- if only for a moment -- found some kind of equilibrium here. The river offers solace, cleanliness -- but the river takes, too, and who knows how long this tenuous community will last, before they are all washed away?<br/><br/><b>Themes:</b> Loss, balance, community, what the river gives and takes, past misdeeds and salvation.<br/><b>Tone:</b> Dark, surreal, unexpectedly thoughtful, unexpectedly violent. Tom Waits, Buck 65, Bruce Springsteen circa "Nebraska." Saturated colours, you can always hear the river, and everything is damp and heavy.<br/><b>Possible types:</b> The runaway; the ex-con; the river-criminal/smuggler; the gypsy musician; the suicide; the mystic; the ruined professional from the city; the serial killer; the lunatic who lives in a fridge; the old man in a suit who plays the three-stringed violin.<br/><br/><b>The Pink Rose Hotel</b><br/>The Pink Rose Hotel is not really a hotel, though it may have a few rooms for rent. It's a whorehouse, a brothel in the wrong part of town. Its clientele are strange and varied, and for good reason -- the Pink Rose is no ordinary brothel. Many of the girls who work there have a strange ability -- they can channel the spirits of the dead. It's all part of the business, though -- grieving widows come to sleep with the spirit of their dead wife (or husband). Some come merely to speak with those they have lost -- or to speak with the dead for less emotional reasons. And of course, some just come for the sex.<br/><br/><b>Themes:</b> Sex, power, mourning, vessels, emotional dependancy, dead people, memories.<br/><b>Tone:</b> Lurid, washed-out, mystical, <i>humanist</i>. Strange combinations of tenderness and emotional manipulation. Psychosexual drama. Ever read any Haruki Murakami? Ever see a Won Kar Wai film? Mash 'em up. I'd like to set this one in Japan or Hong Kong (with as much attention to the differences as our writers can provide.) Unlike Curtains, ghosts here are definitely people, and the world of ghosts is only tenuously separate from the world of the living. <br/><b>Possible types:</b> the ingenue/medium; the madam; the grizzled eunuch/bouncer; the journalist; the mourning businessman; the jaded prostitute; the survivor; the wilfully-ignorant cop; the front-desk clerk; the one guy who actually stays at the hotel and doesn't know its a brothel; the newcomer.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm willing to go ahead on any of those, unless Star Wars 2.5 trumps it all (no offense intended there, I think the screenplay excerpt there is awesome!)                        </div>

                            There's no reason we can't produce an episode of 'whatever we feel like tonight', more choices are always good. They're all so serious though....<br/><br/>Of course now I have to decide whether fan mail sticks with a player even when we're talking about totally different shows. I lean towards "yes", does anyone have a compelling reason it should be "no"?                        </div>

                            Curtains is fairly easy to make less-serious -- just adjust levels of comedy v. drama.<br/><br/>If you wanted someone to write the next "Friends," you should have hired somebody else! Somebody without a soul.                        </div>
