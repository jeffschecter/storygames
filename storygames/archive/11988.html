The player can accept, contest, or clash (provided that the evil vizier is actually a component and not just story color).  Why not allow Grund to try to bust down the door or pick the lock using a quick system that's a lot less drawn out than a clash, but doesn't take over the position of Chronicler and make it so the event never happened in the first place?  What I'm thinking of is based on a Contest but the winner gets spoils (like removing a constraint) and the dice.  It's kind of a mini clash, but without all of the gravity and fanfare.  Why wouldn't players just resist each incidence of pain with a trait?  If you fail, you get even more pain.  Here's the idea:\n<blockquote>A component may use a trait to attempt to resist pain.  The Chronicler uses the die offered for the pain and the player chooses a die from their Dice Horde equal in size to the relevant trait or smaller.  Spoils: the Chronicler must wager a weakness first: "Failed to ..." (whatever was being attempted).  Flinching reduces it to default spoils with no other ill effects.  The winner gets the spoils and the die (unlike in a contest, where the loser would get the die, but dice gotten from Boneyard wagers go back to the Boneyard, as in contests).  Default spoils for the Chronicler are a weakness: "Failed to ..." and the default spoils for the player are to negate the pain inflicted by the Chronicler.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
