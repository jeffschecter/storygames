I adore how it is about the city, and the characters are lenses - almost always complimentary and opposed - through which the city as an entity is viewed.  So you get the rising and falling arc of a drug kingpin and his play for power, and it parallels the race for mayor.  Or how the city schools are a twisted reflection of the police force.  Wheels within wheels, sympathetic and reprehensible characters in opposition and concordance, gripping stories and story-telling.  I like how each season is really an extended rumination that rewards steady viewing without losing the episodic punch of television.

Oh, and his estranged mother lives in Miami as well.<br/><br/>I love that the show is supposed to be about covert ops and finding out the truth.  But it's really about the main character's commitment and family issues.<br/><br/>And the voiceovers the main character does during the show really add a lot to the experience.  I'd love to see more use of voiceovers in PTA.<br/><br/>I also love the use of Miami as a character in the show.  Miami Vice did this back in the 80s, but Burn Notice really threads the feeling of being in places like South Beach into the narrative of the show.  Their use of scenic montage to setup scenes is particularly interesting, and I think this could translate to a PTA game as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167813/#Comment_167813" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T16:29:27+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  4:29PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite current TV show, and the best current TV show, is <i>Pushing Daisies.</i>  It's contribution to PTA is that it hits a tone and just keeps hitting it and hitting it and hitting it and hitting it, in every aspect, from plot to character to voiceover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167817/#Comment_167817" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T16:43:24+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  4:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Wire is the best thing that's ever been on TV, but everyone knows that.<br/><br/>I'm a big Veronica Mars fan.

Where is the next great HBO show?  Carnivale is particularly heartbreaking for all the plot threads it created that were never fully developed much less resolved before it was canceled.<br/><br/>I love It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia but I think pure comedy is really hard to game.  Sure, humor and funny situations arise in role-playing, inside of PTA or out, but rapid fire funny writing and characterization is hard (impossible?) to replicate live even for professional improvisers.<br/><br/>My favorite current show that I would love to game is "Intelligence."  I love crime drama and Intelligence would really translate well to PTA.  It's character-driven, the characters are developed quickly and they all have clear agendas, but they are complicated.  The plots twist on a dime, but always plausibly.  There's a lot of good acting, but Ian Tracey (Jimmy Reardon) and Klea Scott (Mary Spalding) are particularly good.

Recurring characters are the Moon, Ol' Gregg, various shaman chums of Naboo, cockney geezer the 'Itcher with his polo eye. Each show features a song in a different style from the punk of 'I took a shit on your mum (and she rather liked it)' to the cockney knees-up dance cross-over 'Eels (comin' up inside you)'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167893/#Comment_167893" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T06:11:49+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  6:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Avatar.

Then as much as I love The Wire, it doesn't count, it's done. If it does, then the Television show I loved the most is Monster. Monster is Anime based on a Manga series of the same name, created by Naoki Urasawa. The anime is very interesting as it manages to hold a palpable sense of tension over it's 74 episodes. At the same time it's very understated and very human. The story focuses on Dr. Tenma a Japanese doctor working as a brain surgeon in a prestigious German hospital. After saving a little boy, he discovers he's saved a Monster, an almost anti-christ figure. The show is about his trying to figure out who the boy was, and is, and Dr. Tenma's quest to confront the boy, what he'll give up to face his responsibility, and to make a choice about who he is. It's one of the most wonderful things I've ever seen, but you can't purchase it in America. I'll leave you to puzzle out the logistics of how I've encountered it.<br/><br/>I also liked Raines which was a seven episode TV show that got cancelled about two or three seasons ago. It features Jeff Goldblum, as a sarcastic detective who can talk to dead people. However, these people aren't actually dead, they're figments of his imagination, and he knows it. The show is a bit of a twist on the serial crime drama, in that I think it doesn't portray the characters as untouched by the ugliness around them, which most of these shows do. Raines is slowly losing his mind. It also contains one of the few things I've seen, on television, that has frightened me all the way to feeling that sickness in the stomach. You can watch it on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/raines" rel="nofollow">Hulu.com</a> <br/><br/>I like Chuck, which is a current NBC show, which is about a slacker tech-nerd-type guy, who has the CIA and NSA databases put into his head. Of course the actual database is destroyed, which requires the CIA, and NSA to work with him to fight bad guys. It's basically an action adventure romp, with nerdy goodness.<br/><br/>I also liked Life, which is another cop show, where the main character has returned to police work after being wrongfully imprisoned for 10 or 15 years. In his prison time he's taken up an americanized Zen Buddhism which he uses to solve crimes, and irritate his partner. Underneath something darker is hiding as he tries to figure out the conspiracy that put him in jail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167910/#Comment_167910" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T06:57:41+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  6:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Wire is not the best show on TV ever.

One of the best things on TV, as well.<br/><br/>Pushing Daisies is also excellent.<br/><br/>The American and British versions of The Office are worth a hearty mention, if they're not already on there.

Often funny, with actual character development and change.<br/><br/>If you want negative examples, I recommend Smallville.

Another thing I quite like, which I've since adopted as an unspoken rule in my PTA games, is that there are (almost) no hardcore violence/moral greyness/fantastic/off-the-wall elements. It's all reasonably down-to-earth stuff (within the slightly skewed perspective of the show of course). One if the things I noticed in PTA games, is that the more "out there" or hardcore the show becomes, the less engaging and interesting it is. Instead of characters I can relate to as a viewer/player I end up with caricatures of "cool", "clever" or "post-modern hipness".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167950/#Comment_167950" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T09:15:02+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  9:15AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know PTA, but I usually see Doctor Who popping up in threads like that (RPG threads about TV series).

That all comes down to how many conflicts the Director presents.  An episode of Three's Company has continual conflict.  But there are some shows where protagonists get their way 75% of the time and some shows where they get their way 25% of the time, shows where they are constantly thwarted.

I just finished the first Season of Heroes tonight. I love the show, and Ryan's dead right, but goddammit, the ending was crap! That vision of the future thing bit them in the ass, just like roleplayers "playing before they play" and having the ending all talked out to the point where you're just going through the motions when you <i>play</i> the scene. And the denoument was a gut-punch to everyone's struggle and interweaving "destinies" throughout the story.<br/><br/>Also, that stuff about Hope and Heart was corny as hell. It totally was the thematic core of the story, but clumsily done. It was like, "shit, guys, last episode! We better tie in the Big Theme!"<br/><br/>But the reason I'm so mad is that it <i>was</i> an amazing show.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I second the Office. It's comedy, sure, but it's a comedy of deep and abiding <i>pain.</i><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>If you want negative examples, I recommend Smallville.

I've only got 2 friends I regularly game with, and it doesn't seem like 1 Producer and 2 players is a good setup.  But this thread isn't for talking about that!<br/>Still, my understanding is shows that are good examples for PTA are... ensemble shows that don't have a single main character?  And probably shows with at least some level of constant plot that runs through the series/season rather than being purely episodic?<br/>Seems like <i>Heroes</i> fits that bill pretty well.<br/><br/>My other favorite shows are <i>Veronica Mars</i>, which has been mentioned, and <i>Dexter</i>, which I can't believe no one has mentioned!  I just discovered it and watching the first two seasons on DVD consumed all my free time for the last couple weeks.<br/>I think both of these have the same good points for PTA and the same bad points.<br/>Good = Strong characters that develop and plotlines that run through the season.<br/>Bad = Only one true Main Character.  Veronica and Dexter, obviously.  Everyone else, even the other major characters, are only really important insofar as they relate to the story of the Main Character's life.  I mean, I don't think there is a single episode of either show in which Veronica or Dexter would have a screen presence lower than 3.  The are the titular characters, after all.  Others wax and wane, but they are always at the forefront.  Not very PTA there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168906/#Comment_168906" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-13T18:28:50+00:00" title="September 13, 2008  6:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/S/shameless/" rel="nofollow">Shameless</a> ever been aired on US television?
