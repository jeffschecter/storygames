(8 pages, pdf.)<br/><br/>This isn't Actual Play; it's Virtual Play, an imaginary scene with imaginary players that gives a feel of what I'm striving for. It's been a very useful exercise, because it's shown me all kinds of weaknesses (and possibly unnecessary complexities) in the rules. The conflict rules are going to have a big revision as a result of it.<br/><br/>I think the most useful thing it gives to someone reading it, though, is a feel for how the cooperative creation of the story happens (or is intended to happen). It shows people at a table playing the game, and how they introduce new stuff into the fiction and develop and expand on it. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">It's a bit like test-first software development, where you come up with something that you want the thing to do first, and then design towards making that happen.</span> No it isn't - see below.<br/><br/>Several current Story-Games discussions have informed it in one way or another; <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3710&amp;page=1#Item_42" rel="nofollow">What Are Story-Games</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3695&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">Story-Game Skillz are Hard</a>, to name two, plus of course the discussions on minimizing specialist terminology in your game text - that made a huge difference to what this example ended up looking like.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to hear from anyone else who's done something similar. Also, any critiques of any aspect (the remaining specialized terminology, the rules themselves, the presentation, anything else that strikes you as having potential for improvement).<br/><br/>And, of course, the other important question: Does reading it make you want to play this game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83901/#Comment_83901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T16:41:48+00:00" title="July 29, 2007  4:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a huge fan of virtual play.<br/><br/>But I don't write it out.

Otherwise you may create an idealized version of what would happen at the table, which may seem stilted to a reader.

However, in my own training (Computer Science, not Software Engineering, if it makes a difference) everyone I have discussed this with has suggested that having someone else write your tests for you is always good form. The alternative is to formally prove the validity of your test suite by exhausting all other feasible alternatives, which in the case of many algorithms is practically impossible.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>you're setting your own goals before you set forth to achieve them. Nothing wrong with that in my book, nor in any of the reading I've done on software methodology.</blockquote>\nEdit: No, that's writing specs, not writing tests. Specs leads to tests, but tests you write yourself are still biased because you're expecting something to occur. Others writing the tests should ideally have access to the specs, but have no idea of what your expected end result is.<br/><br/>It depends on what software you're writing. If you can trust the end-user of your code (I'll tie this back into roleplaying somehow) then go ahead and write your tests to prove that your code works for your intended use. If you can't trust the end-user to use your code responsibly, by (for example) feeding it appropriate input, then tests that only prove your code works for your set of inputs is near useless.<br/><br/>The disconnect may be that in my training, I've not seen much of a distinction between testing and QA. QA tests the final product and failure at this stage usually require bug fixes. Testing while writing your code will make QA a rubber stamping process at best, if the design was correct from the beginning. The programmer (or team, as the case may be) handles 90% of the QA process on their small piece of code right as it's being written. In the end, this causes leaner, meaner code without the bloat of retroactive patching.<br/><br/>So to tie this back into roleplaying, if you can trust the end-user of your game to play the game in the method you intended, then by all means go ahead and write your own VP. The end-user will read it, nod in appreciation, and use it to reinforce what they were already thinking when they read your rules. It may even help them to avoid some pitfalls, by focusing them on play the way you intended it. It also serves as marketing for your game, which is great.<br/><br/>Here's where things get worse. If you <i>can't</i> "trust" your players - i.e. people reading your game may misinterpret how it's played, provide the wrong set of inputs, or use mechanics incorrectly - then people reading the VP and then playing the game may find that the two don't mesh. Yes, the VP may help them understand how to play it, but if they fundamentally misunderstand something critical about the game a VP report will mostly serve to frustrate. <br/><br/>For example, I misunderstood Dogs for an investigation game until a friend set me straight on the matter. As the GM, I was weaving this intricate web of sins and sinners, and I intuitively thought the Dogs would come into town and neatly unravel it. They'd find out who the original sinner was and heal the town of its ills. The game did not convey to me that this was not the purpose of the game (I probably missed some paragraph somewhere). I didn't mind - I thought Dogs was a great little investigation game with some intra-party conflict and moral dilemmas thrown in. Not until recently did I realize how much <i>better</i> it would play if the Dogs came to the town and <i>got caught in</i> the web, having to claw and fight their way out of it, while coping with sins of their own and being burdened with too much authority and responsibility for their age.<br/><br/>As a GM, I clearly provided the wrong inputs into the game design. Vincent can't trust me as a player. If he was writing a VP, and he saw an AP report from me ahead of time, he should have rubbed my nose in the section of the rules that say "This ain't a bloody investigation game" and set me straight, then written a VP piece that reflected <i>the polar opposite</i> of my original understanding.<br/><br/>So to sum up - if you're writing a VP piece yourself, without any AP to base it on, I don't think it's test-first software development at all - I think it's writing specs.<br/>Specs lead to testing, but the AP will be the final test whether or not those specs were fulfilled.<br/>And finally, just because an subsequent AP "succeeded" (met the specs, passed the test) doesn't mean that another group won't provide totally wonky input and mess up the test. Your game isn't "proven". If you want to prove that your game consistently generates certain effects, you have to either do so formally (possible only if the players cannot be proactive, only reactive, with regards to the mechanics) or through extensive testing using tests others have written.<br/><br/>This is mostly just rambling but I'm too tired to edit it. I think software development and game design has some interesting cross-sections and I hope someone out there may find this useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DigitalRaven" title="DigitalRaven"><img alt="DigitalRaven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.digitalraven.org/731318.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DigitalRaven">DigitalRaven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84129/#Comment_84129" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T13:06:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  1:06PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that VP is a very valuable tool for game design, but it can't exist in a vacuum.<br/><br/>One round of VP to begin with, almost as a "mental model" of the game, helps you clarify and codify your design goals and see if what you have so far lives up to what you want it to \u2014 what parts work well, and what parts get in the way.<br/><br/>Once you've done that, you can keep doing it once you've developed more, to see how your development has changed. Incremental unit-tests, for programmers.<br/><br/>No game can work without Actual Play, which brings in invaluable outside viewpoints and insights (the systems test) and then leads to another round of VP, when the designer abstracts what the players could have done against what they did, whether they exploited \u2014 or ignored \u2014 any loopholes in the mechanics, and so on. From there, the designer can build a more comprehensive VP (integration testing), which is the best round to release to the public, possibly alongside the AP to illustrate several of the options that the actual playtest didn't pick up on.<br/><br/>Claimer: I have a CS degree and spent two years as a software tester but that was in another country, and besides, the project's dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84146/#Comment_84146" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T14:18:45+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  2:18PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Mikael and Stew, you've brought out what I was actually driving at more clearly than I did.
