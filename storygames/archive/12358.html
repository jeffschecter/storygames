In this case, it's more of a shared activity thing over a period of time.<br/><br/>We had the "Play THIS with THAT contest": People were paired another game with a system of their choice: For example, I was given the task of running Vampire using a fantasy action system. That was fun.<br/><br/>Looking for ideas of other group-ish activities that might be interesting to keep in mind for the future. Little community activities with a shelf date of a month or two, that are distinctly PLAY focused, not DESIGN focused. To celebrate, y'know, play over game design and all that.<br/><br/>Feel free to brainstorm: Not really interested in folks critiquing others' ideas, just throw stones into this soup, even if you readily admit the idea might be dumb.<br/><br/>Also, maybe this is a challenge: I'm wondering what there is to explore specifically from a Player point of view. Previous contests tend to be GM-focused (as a lot of folks here are the GMs or cores of their gaming groups), but looking to see what sort of blood we can squeeze from player-stones.<br/><br/>Previous contests include:<br/>* Post a relationship map from one of your campaigns/games.<br/>* Play one game with another system.<br/>* Post a cool actual play from one of your recent games.<br/><br/>I'll post my random thoughts in the next post.<br/><br/>EDIT: I noticed as I was posting, one or two of the ideas I had were actually regarding personal GM/Player weaknesses I have that I'm looking to get over. Feel free to find your own flaws and turn those into ideas as well.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277253/#Comment_277253" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T07:42:42+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  7:42AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note: I end up using the designation "run for at least two sessions" a lot. I think this is to actually try to generate real content. A one-shot can be so throw-away, but actually aiming for at least 2-3 solid sessions takes real effort, produces more "realistic" data.<br/><br/>* You are a GM. You find another GM in another physical location. Between you, agree to run an at least 3-session game over the course of 2 months, using the same system. Blog the activities of your table, see the activities of the other table, and combine them into your next session. Variance is expected ("In our last session, we ended up tracking down and killing your hacker "Brainburn" in our session").<br/><br/>* Tabula Rasa: Run a game where the players wake up and have no memories of their past or identity for at least two sessions. Use any system you see fit.<br/><br/>* OMG Characterz: Play or run a game of at least two sessions, where all the players at the table control at least 3-4 characters each.<br/><br/>* No Combat: Run 2+ sessions of a game where physical combat or violence is simply not an option (not shoe-horning the scenes into making sure there's no violence, but just agreeing with the other players that no physical combat will happen from the player-characters). There can be swordfights, gunfights etc but they are not instigated or resolved by the PCs. Beyond that, anything goes.<br/><br/>* Many Faces: For the next session, as GM, come up with 4 "notable" NPCs. For each one, come up with a completely different style of speech/interaction for each one, and play those out with the PCs.<br/>(this one is for myself: I notice that in one of my groups, me and Quintin tend to fall back on "Slow, cautious and sarcastic male NPC" trend, looking to do more to break that up).<br/><br/>* Bluebooking: 3-session game minimum, every player (and GM) engages in "blue-booking", that is creating artifacts (usually journals, could be physical or blogging, etc) in that character's point of view. At the beginning of each following session, folks share what they wrote down. At the end of the campaign, within your group vote for the coolest bluebooking. Share the results with us here. Feel free to encourage the bluebooking with in-game rewards (XP is a standard for bluebooking in J-RPGs; else items, plot points, etc).<br/><br/>* Elements: Pick an element structure (Earth/Fire/Air/Water; Earth/Fire/Air/Water/Metal; etc), design an adventure around it. Like Game Chef, but focused on a scenario design. Then run that scenario for your players.<br/><br/>* Cultural dissonance: In your next campaign, have all the PCs but one be from the same culture/societal background. Then, focus plotlines on the clash of cultures that develops, and encourage player roleplaying of the differences in culture. Post the results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277256/#Comment_277256" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T07:59:05+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  7:59AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play three (3) sessions of a campaign-style game, using the same players and characters, but with a different game system for each session. <br/><br/>(Example: A samurai epic using In A Wicked Age the first week, Legends of the Five Rings the second week and the 'Ronin' hack of Dust Devils the third week).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277262/#Comment_277262" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T08:09:47+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  8:09AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play ______ Right Now: Come up with a really great concept that doesn't really fit any existing game system super well.

I always pick a couple areas to workshop every time I start a new game. My games tend to wrap up in 8 or so sessions so even if it's a not-fun workshop I know it'll be over eventually. In my current BW game I've challenged myself with:<br/><br/>* Big cast of players. This is my first 6p BW game and it is a huge logistical and creative challenge.<br/><br/>* Rich, believable female npcs. I get lazy with this and the characters often fall into bad genre/misogynistic stereotypes.<br/><br/>* Intrigue over violence. Actually I'm good at this when it's npc schemers. But now the challenge is to engineer events so that all the scheming comes from the players.<br/><br/>I'd be super interested to hear from players who similarly work to challenge themselves. I have great players but none that I know of who do this.<br/><br/>Anything worth doing is worth doing well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277264/#Comment_277264" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T08:13:14+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  8:13AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to do stuff with rotating GMs and characters, while continuing the same game.<br/><br/>I like Brian's idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277324/#Comment_277324" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T11:13:38+00:00" title="June 22, 2010 11:13AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going for challenges for the entire group here:<br/><br/>* Play a mini-campaign backwards using an advancement system game of your choice: start out with the final session of your campaign where everything is revealed or resolved. Then work backwards (leveling down the characters as needed), the next session must end where the previous session began, and so on. Among other things this requires the players and the GM (if any) to work together much more than in a typical traditional campaign, as a reference to the past can lock some difficult things in. <br/><br/>* Musical chairs mini-campaign: after two sessions each following session the players (GM included) randomly hand back out the characters and the GM role. The first two sessions are to ensure that the characters have been established. The goal here is to maintain the tone of the characters even as the players change - or the tone of the game if you are the next GM. Some drift may be unavoidable, but the idea is to work against it so that players and the GM can more directly see how their behavior is perceived during play.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277327/#Comment_277327" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T11:27:43+00:00" title="June 22, 2010 11:27AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) REALLY liked the Play THIS with THAT "challenge" let's call them.
