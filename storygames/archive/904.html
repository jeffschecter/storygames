<div class="Message">
                    I'm reading through Iron Heroes these days. For those who don't know the game, it's a variant for 3rd Ed. D&amp;D. It includes good concepts, one of them being tokens. See, you can gather different tokens depending on your character class (or feat), and then use those tokens for special effects such as attack bonuses, causing penalties, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately notice, however, that you have to expend the token before your attack roll (i.e., it's Fortune at the End). That kind of mechanic has always been frustrating to me. Here I am, building up a resource, then spending it on a potential effect, and if I miss my roll, it's completely wasted (most of the time; not if it was a bonus to attack, but if it was a bonus to damage, bonus v. armor, penalty, etc.). For me, that sucks.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like it to be like this: I roll, then I can spend a token to bring about a special effect. In other words, a Fortune in the Middle type of mechanic that avoids the frustration of wasting precious resources on a bad roll.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: what are the advantages of having it the FitE way? Why is the design like that? I can't think of any reason to allow a waste of precious resources other than maybe some risk/gambling involved (or maybe balancing concerns with regular D&amp;D?), but for me, that would wear thin really fast after wasting my resource enough times. The combination of having very few tokens (at least at low levels) that do relatively little and then can potentially wasted just ruin the whole mechanic for me.<br/>
<br/>
So again: what am I not seeing here? Does it work out better in actual play? And, more broadly, when you design (or choose) a game, why do/would you have a FitE mechanic for scarce resources?                </div>

                            Yeah, for me I don't dig that kind of thing any time I see it ("Spend a BLANK point THEN roll the dice"), which I see from time to time.  It always feels to me like:<br/><br/>1) The designer simply wasn't thinking<br/>2) They wanted to make BLANK points a scarse resource, but with commonality of bad rolls (non-curve), it seems to beg, "why include the resource at all"?<br/>3) It should be immediately houseruled to allow for spending after the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>I forgot which system it was, but I've seen instances where the resource wasn't that scarce, and you had a choice of like "spend 1 point before the dice are rolled, or spend 3 points AFTER the dice are rolled", which totally works in my book, espcially where a "gamble" of sorts is implied.<br/><br/>But yeah, for me, and what I know of Iron Heroes (and it IS awesome), it seems to be an oversight or mistake that needs to be corrected by not limiting expenditure to before the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            One of the ideas I had for a D&amp;D gamehack was a feat that allows you to spend resources after the appropriate roll, instead of before them.  But in a game where this is an option, I could see it being a must have for certain characters (anything with expendable resources, so most D&amp;D classes), so why make it a feat when you could just make it a houserule?                        </div>

                            Andy - how do you feel about the D&amp;D spells that have a save for no effect?<br/>
<br/>
I think if regaining the resource is predictable, it's not too bad, especially if you get enough of the resource to use it several times during a game session such that it is likely to benefit you at least a few times per session. So D&amp;D spells generally fit into this category.<br/>
<br/>
In Arcana Unearthed/Evolved, where you had to earn hero points, and people tended to only have the one they started with, perhaps earning one or two more over the course of the game, they were virtually only ever used after the fact to avoid dying (the one thing they could be used for after the fact).<br/>

I feel like that's only semantically distinct; there are a lot of spells where you have an attack roll or something else that determines whether it has any effect. Since there aren't any resources that defenders generally need to expend in order to respond defensively to attacks, this means that you're basically spending resources to <em>make attack rolls at all.</em> </div>

That Iron Heroes mechanic is gambling. Gambling is fun. Any discussion of the mechanic which doesn't take into account these two factors is missing the mark. That's the whole reason why "fortune at the end" (or whatever, that phrase seems to add nothing past 'gambling') is used so much. Because gambling is fun and billions have people have done it for thousands of years.                        </div>

                            JD, fortune at the end is used to add tension to a roll as you say, yeah, but when the whole system is about tactical decisions? Gambling can only serve to drain your resources.<br/><br/>In the case of Blackjack, there's no game without the risk associated with gambling. With Iron Heroes (as I understand it) it's about tactical decisionmaking. It's supposedly about decisions and consequences. Those coins aren't there to risk; they're there to empower you as a player. You've presumably already expended resources to get them, right?<br/><br/>With FatE, you can: spend a coin and it makes a difference; spend a coin and you would have lost the roll anyway; or spent a coin and you would have won anyway.<br/><br/>With FitM, you can: make a roll. If the coin will help you, you spend it; if it won't help you, you won't. Perhaps you can spend more coins? That way, success costs the player more or fewer resources depending on mechanical circumstance.<br/><br/>To some people, gambling's fun. But that's been the assumed method of praxis for so long in game design that other options have been left unexplored. I don't know much about Iron Heroes but from the adoring words of Chris Chinn and Andy. I assume that it largely does what it sets out to do, but this sounds to me like an element that's contrary to the design goals of the game.<br/><br/>Can someone whisper me a rundown of the specifics of coin economy?                        </div>

                            I like the gambling point--it's been a while since I looked back through IH, but it seems like you can get those token pools built up pretty quickly by doing cool things.  It isn't quite like standard D&amp;D where the Monk burns one of his cool stunning fist attacks and doesn't get it back until the next day.  Instead, true, they lose the token, but can get more by doing more cool stuff.  If the player didn't have to risk tokens, they could stockpile them more easily and avoid having to do the cool stuff needed to recharge.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't just about tactics but performing cool, thematic actions.  Gambling just encourages the players to do more of those thematic actions. Even the loss of a token furthers game play--it makes the player more willing to do cool stuff to get back what they lost.  Heck, if I'm wrong about how that works in IH, it seems like that is one cool way it should work.                        </div>

                            It would be cool if you had a system where you burn (say) tokens before you take an action for whatever bonus. If you succeed, all is good. If you fail, that token goes into some other pool - maybe something that builds up over time and had certan thresholds that have an effect on you, or on all the players; maybe it becomes a token for the target of your failed action; maybe it transfers to a resource that you can only spend on negative-y things. The point is that it doesn't just go away in the economy, failure transfers it somewhere interesting.                        </div>

                            I did mention the risk/gambling aspect in my initial post; my argument is that, with a scarce resource, gambling like that becomes more frustrating than not. Not for everyone, obviously, as we all know we have different play preferences. But for me it does. That's why I asked if there's anything else I'm not seeing that could make up for it <i>for me</i>. So I'm not hating on the concept, I just personally don't find it satisfying because, as Joshua says, I'm into making my decisions, and I think that rolling the D20 once is gambling enough. Otherwise, you have to gamble on when to use your scarce resource, then whether you actually hit, and finally some token actions even allow a saving throw, so there's another hurdle. Iron Heroes characters are supposed to be big shot heroes, and anything that raises the whiff factor outside of the player's control goes against that, <i>for me</i>.<br/><br/>You don't get tokens through cool actions; you can get bonuses through cool actions, so in a way, you can make it more likely that your tokens will work if you use a challenge or stunt with the action. But only for your attack roll.<br/><br/>Say I'm an Executioner at level 1. I get one token to start with. I can spend an action to gain two more. But I need to make an opposed roll for that, and if I want to have a good chance at success, I need to spend my attack action collecting those tokens. So: first I gamble whether I actually get any tokens. Then I gamble when I use the tokens whether I hit or not. And with my first ability, Hindering Cut (as well as many later ones), there is a saving throw that totally negates the effect. Three gambles, two of which I can't influence with stunts/challenges. And all that for potentially inflicting a -1 penalty on my opponent.<br/><br/>Sorry, but for me, that just sucks.                        </div>

                            Yeah, the token system in IH needs work.  Some of the classes get them all the time (Berserker), and others like Executioner or Hunter have to give up precious actions in order to get them.  The feats, stunts, and challenges are what make IH good, the tokens, not quite as much.<br/><br/>On the other hand, once you do have tokens, you can usually spend them along with stunts/challenges, making it more likely for them to succeed instead of getting wasted.                        </div>

                            I think the real dissatisfaction is centered over the fact that the only thing you can do with your tokens is gamble.  Right?  I mean, if I've got real money I can choose to gamble it in Las Vegas, or I can go downtown and buy a slice of cheesecake.  I've got broad options.  From my reading, <i>Iron Heroes</i> makes tokens more like casino chips.  You can gamble them in all sorts of interesting ways inside the casino, but you can't buy a cheesecake with them.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

How is the fact that this is meant to be a tactical decision relevant at all? A lot of miniatures wargaming uses dice to introduce a random element into tactical decisionmaking. Hell, Risk! Risk! Look at Risk!  Gambling is a well-worn part of tactical and strategic games since times of yore.<br/>

                            I agree with you on the gambling parallel, but with the low-level Executioner example, it sounds like (to continue the metaphor) it would be like walking into a casino to play blackjack with a single $5 chip. One resource pip.<br/><br/>EDIT: And I think there is a parallel with luck (dice) and tactics, in the overall metaphor of gambling.<br/><br/>5 card draw is High Luck, Low Tactics.<br/>Texas Hold'em is a good balance between Luck and Tactics.<br/>I have been told that Mahjonng is the <i>perfect balance</i> between Luck and Tactics (by mahjongg freaks who have also played poker, blackjack, etc).<br/><br/>We all get the party line that Iron Heroes is high tactics, and it's all wrapped up in a gamble. The thing is, though, that it appears that for certain low level classes that only get a few Points, that they have to rely more on luck than tactics until they beef up, while the rest of the elements of the game are seeped in a greater balance between luck and tactics.<br/><br/>In the end, it probably boils bown to a "how much tactics vs luck do you like in this kind of game?" question. <br/><br/>Maybe we can look into hacks for the game, even narrow ones ("give executioners one more chip at 1st level"), to bring the system into an equilibrium that works better for the thread starter and others.<br/><br/>Oh, and good point on magic, Shreyas: I think it's worth nothing that I've played D&amp;D about 10 times, AD&amp;D 2E about 100-150 times, and D&amp;D 3E about 15 times, and I never, ever, played a mage. The closest I got was a a multi-classed priest-something (and it was a specialty priest without a lot of spells). I could just never get into the way that the magic stuff worked.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

I must say I'm heavy into the gambling side. You pays yer money and you takes yer chances. It provides tension for that exchange and for all the following exchanges. In my game, you can blow one resource to mitigate the loss of another. If you don't want to lose a Cash investment, put your Stats on the line. If you can't stand risk your Stats, put Security out there. <br/>
<br/>
These risks need to be communicated to the players before the game of course. If they're frustrated by loss, find another game.                        </div>

                            Andy, I like your metaphor because I think there would be an even more unique thrill of gambling with only one chip than there would be with a stack.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't think that's an accurate metaphor. Remember, these are bonus chips that produce various special effects. You're not out of the game when you are out of tokens.  So really, it's like playing blackjack with a set amount of small stakes mandatory for every hand, but once per day (or week or whatever), you can elect to make this next hand "really count" and throw down a very valuable stake.<br/>
<br/>
Balancing receiving the tokens is a Good Idea, though.                        </div>

I agree, too. And someone will have to school me if I'm wrong (it's been about half a year since I've seen the Iron Heroes book), but IIRC, and what I'm hearing of certain classes and balance is that no matter who you are, when you roll up to a table of Iron Heroes it's basically liks stepping up to a table of blackjack (or mahjongg, running with my tactics-luck metaphor above): It's just that, like, Berserkers start off with a handful of chips, while the acrobat (the fast class, was that it?) or executioner starts off with like one chip to gamble with.<br/><br/>Maybe boosting low level chips to 2 or 3 might resolve that easily, or maybe it creates more complications.<br/><br/>EDIT:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>But I don't think that's an accurate metaphor.</blockquote>
Ahh, good point, yeah you're not totally out when you use up your chips. But your class uniqueness is surely spent, and you have to fall back on general feats and tactics.<br/><br/>Oh, mind y'all, I haven't played Iron Heroes yet but I'm really excited by it, and am dying to give it a shot as a player. It's like the only d20-ish clone-thing that I am really Really interested in (and I think Chris was responsible for that, way back from our conversations about it back in the GenCon hotel room).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Gambling falls short of what's going on here.  <br/>
<br/>
Choosing to spend a token before a roll means that I increase the cost to myself, but I receive no proprotionate (or, as may be more apt for gambling, disproportionate) reward or possibility of reward for doing so.  The reward is no larger.  I've increased my _likelihood_ of success, but I have not changed the nature of succes and, in fact, I'm paying more for it.<br/>
<br/>
In gambling terms, this equates roughly to buying more numbers at the roulette wheel.  I increase my chances of winning with each additional bet, but I diminish my overall reward.  Now, that's not to say there's no appeal to it - the same logic encourages us to buy multiple lottery tickets because the perceived value of a win is so much greater than the additional investment, whereas the roulette table makes the additional cost more obvious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm confident that everyone present appreciates just how compelling a true element of gambling can be, and it seems rude to assume otherwise, so the question is really, does the token system provide those benefits?<br/>
<br/>
For me, the question comes back to what the stakes are.  If one perceives the token to be the stakes...well, that seems like a sucker's game.  I spend tokens, and I do not get them back, not much fun there.  On the other hand, if the stakes of the scene are the stakes, then I'm uncertain how the tokens tie into things - those stakes don't change.  If the proposal is that it's actually some sort of currency-exchange of tokens and scene, I'd have to ask for an explanation of how that works.<br/>
<br/>
So, to my mind, spending a token before the roll has none of the thrill of gambling - all of the thrill that I can get from the situation already exists in the die roll I'm going to make.  With that in mind, the gambling benefit seems non-existant, and by extension, can be disposed of without regret in favor of a system that provides some other benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I think that there _are_ benefits to spending after a roll, but I don't think that needs elaborating.  The question is whether those benefits are outweighed by something else.<br/>
<br/>
-Rob D.<br/>
<br/>
PS - For the record, if there is some "Double or nothing" or similar component in the expenditure of tokens that adds some genuine gambling component (which is to say, a little risk/reward goodness)  that I'm unaware of, I would be delighted to hear about it.<br/>
<br/>
PPS - Similarly, this is a less broad defense of fortune at the end mechanics.  Most of the better ones genuinely have a gambling component, and use it to good effect.                        </div>

                            Rob, now this is something I can sink my teeth into. Good analysis. And people do have different perceptions of what "sucker bets" really are. I can't stand roulette, period, any bet, of any kind.  But I do love blackjack and even slot machines and video poker are fun for a few go-rounds, even though I know logically and mathematically that slots and video poker are wholly artificial in terms of their probabilities, the house can set them at whatever probability/payoff level they want to set, and at least with roulette, you have fixed probabilities.  To some degree it's the suspense and fun of actually participating in the game with my own hands (pulling the lever, pushing the buttons) that makes them more compelling for me than roulette. (It might be different if I were the one spinning the wheel!)<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, I think a token that (for example) boosted your attack bonus in D20 DOES give you something back in the scene. It gives you a more effective attack. Whether the attack is successful or not is, as everyone has noted, a separate thing, and for some that is an issue. But if I walked up to someone at a roulette wheel who knew he was going to play 100 games for $5 each, and I said, "Hey, do you want an extra ten percent chance of a win on this next spin?" you can bet they'd say "hell yeah I would!", and I wouldn't have even given them a choice on the timing of it. And if they still lost, they wouldn't say "man, something is wrong with this game".  <br/>
<br/>
The compelling thing about this token system is that it's an "extra". If you didn't have these tokens, you wouldn't be just throwing up your hands and not playing, and if you ran out, you don't stop playing. You would still be playing, you just wouldn't get a bonus when you felt like getting one.<br/>
<br/>
A little bit of a tangent here, but I hope it is fruitful.                        </div>

                            JD,<br/><br/>If I spend a turn getting tokens, I'm basically spending my other resource (my attack and therefore damage potential) on that. So I'd first pay you $5 for the <i>chance</i> to gain a 5% higher win chance later. But if I make it due to the added 5%, you get to re-roll (saving throw) to see if it helps me after all.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a <i>bad tactical choice</i> to waste my time with the tokens. I expend other resources to get it, and then I have a minimal chance of payoff.<br/><br/>Obviously, a class that automatically gets tokens doesn't have this problem in the same way, but it's still frustrating to see the special resource go to waste.                        </div>

                            That makes sense - but your beef then is that it's not a viable tactical option, not that the gambling element of "this might be useless!" somehow sucks away the tacticalness. You perceive trying to get those tokens as a "sucker bet" - the investment plus the possibility of losing is more than the inherent joy (like me pulling the slot machine handle) plus the possibility of winning. And maybe it is, maybe when we add up the probabilities and multiply by the iterations (or whatever), it is a sucker bet and your perception is 100 percent right, that a player that plays to maximize tactical effectiveness will never pursue the tokens, ever.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the real question: to what degree are sucker bets necessary in a game, tactical or otherwise? I know for a cold hard fact that the Wheel of Fortune is among the worst, the worst, the WORST bet you can find in any casino in Vegas. Yet they don't put up Wheels of Fortune just for show. People play them. LOTS of people play them. And enjoy them. And why not? Blackjack is a much better bet, but it's still, to some degree, a sucker bet, because the house always enjoys just the tiniest fraction of a percentage of advantage. The difference between the two games, probability-wise, is one of degree, not of kind. And that can be seen in the wide variety of bad bets between those two bad bets. <br/>
<br/>
People will take the sucker bet for a lot of reasons - whims, because they enjoy participating in the bet (pulling the lever, manipulating the tokens), peer pressure, drunkenness, misperception of the odds, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
If there is only one best tactical choice at any given point, do you really have much of a tactical game?                        </div>

                            Hey guys,<br/><br/>Let's not get confused here- Mike Mearls wrote IH in 10 weeks.  There are serious rough edges in there, and it's not worthwhile to get too deep into defending or over criticizing them, it's a game that really needed more time.  (WOTC's choices in D20 to deliberately make bunk choices, for "system mastery", is a completely different topic, and worth discussing).<br/><br/>Looking at IH specifically:<br/>- Some classes get Tokens automatically (Berserkers get hit, something that's going to happen anyway)<br/>- Some classes require spending actions to get them<br/>- Some Tokens are earned via Feats- actions, conditions, etc.<br/>- Some things let you spend Tokens for things that are a gamble (+2 to hit, bonus to damage, etc.)<br/>- Some things let you spend Tokens for a SURE thing (instant healing, move an extra square, etc.)<br/><br/>Obviously, in a good tactical design, the "freebie" Tokens ought to get you either weaker or more iffy rewards, and the "expensive" ones ought to get you better or more certain rewards.  This also can be applied to any tactical game and resource spending.<br/><br/>But sucker bets?  Those make up a LOT of game systems, particularly a lot of point-build games.  Often you'll find that there's 1-3 winning strategies, and everything else is a waste of resources- and hardcore groups quickly figure out those strategies or produce their own houserules to make up the difference.  A lot of "system mastery" we've seen is the ability to weed out sucker bets, and not actual in-play mastery of tactics.                        </div>

                            I think the rub, for me, is that tokens seem akin to buying insurance in blackjack - something supplemental to the gambling (in this case, the attack roll) rather than integral to it.  This is probably a function of the specifics of D&amp;D/d20 - the system has no there's no aditional benefit that comes of hitting "better" so I'm increasing my chances, but I'm not impacting the reward, because the reward is fixed.<br/>
<br/>
If we were talking a system where, rather than granting a bonus, spending a token increased your damage _if_ you hit, I would be much more comfortable considering that gambling, since both the risk and reward sides of the equation are getting touched.*<br/>
<br/>
Curiously, I don't think this would work as much with a Margin of Success system, if only because translating the bonus directly into reward is too proportional to hit the button that makes gambling compelling, but that's a whole other topic.<br/>

* And here my ignorance of IH's specifics is telling.  Maybe that's what they do, and I've just been reading it wrong, in which case, gamble away! :)                        </div>

                            I think there's a combination of issues here: the tokens being sucker bets matters more because of the implicit promise of the game that the characters are cooler because they have those at their disposal for doing great things, and then the disparities that Chris lists. If you're trying to sell me on the fact that I can tactically play this cool assassin character with special powers, but then the powers fizzle most of the time, I'm going to be frustrated. In other words, the game doesn't present itself as a sucker bet loaded game, it presents itself as both a tactical decision-making (less fortune-reliant) and a wish fulfillment game (at least in my reading).<br/><br/>But let me get away from IH specifically and back to the broader question. Now that we've established that gambling and possibly having less effective choices to allow people to master the system are two reasons for spending scarce resources before a roll:<br/><br/>a) Are there yet other reasons?<br/>b) What types of play style benefit from this design decision?<br/>c) What types suffer?<br/><br/>In HeroQuest, for example, you spend hero points to improve your result after you make the roll. How would it change the feel and style of the game if you had to spend the point beforehand?                        </div>

                            Given that HQ has "degrees" of success and failure, not much.  Spending the point will almost always make your failures milder and your successes stronger... but not always.  Sometimes the expenditure is wasted.

                            While it's related, the other big impact is on the economy of knowledge.  Take the basic question of "How hard is it to succeed at this?"  Sometimes a player knows, sometimes they don't, and their spendign pattern will depend heavily on these things.<br/>
<br/>
If the player does not know the difficulty, then the incentive is to spend your resources based on the importance of the roll, rather than the difficulty.  In this situation, the advantage in spending after the fact is still present, but is not as pronounced because even after the roll, an expenditure can be wasted.<br/>
<br/>
If the player knows the difficulty, the incentive is to spend the resources when it will have the most optimal impact, which is to say, based on the _difficulty_ of the roll, and the likliehood of success with or without the bonus.  The incentive to spend beforehand exists, but the incentive to spend after the roll is far more powerful as it usually creates a "sure thing".<br/>
<br/>
From a pure game-playing perspective, neither approach is really better - hidden information is as much of an appealling component of play as calculated risk.  Certain other factors, like how difficulties are determined, can play into this - as an example, if the difficulties are hidden, but can be reasonably approximated by players with skill, you have an interesting situation where player knowledge/skill may transform the situation.  However, keeping aware of the interplay gives the designer a good valve to adjust for how he wants player decisions to go.<br/>

                            There's another effect here that's being missed. I'm not really familiar with Iron Heroes, but let's say that a token gives you a +1 to hit. Let's say you normally need a 14, but with the token you need a 15. You roll a 13. You win, but did the token help? <br/>
<br/>
Well, philosophically yes it did. But from a practical POV, it seems to have not made a difference in this case. So, to go to the blackjack analogy it's very similar to being at a table where the table minimum is 14$, but you're allowed to bet up to $15. Big...fucking...deal. <br/>
<br/>
This is the problem with a lot of mechanics like this that the gambled stake is nigh meaningless. If, in fact, the token gives you a +10, then I'd argue that if you still manage to miss, that this is still more fun than if you get a succeess on a roll where the bonus didn't matter because it was too small to matter. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is why dice pools rock, and why it's not a good idea to use different dice to account for bonuses and such. Because once the bonus dice are rolled, you can't tell which were the ones that came up successes, and which failures. Sure, psychological, but that's key. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, estimating effectivenesses of gambling maneuvers is, in fact, an important part of tactics. <br/>

                            Ben's on to you, guys! He totally sees the smack-talking! You're getting away with nothing on his watch! I would have just let it go because the discussion is so interesting, but he's the boss. Whaddya gonna do? His disappointment burns like acid, it does.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I failed my saving throw and took 2D6 in acid damage. If I had known that I was going to miss by just one point, I'd have spent a token! Duh!                        </div>

                            I'm not sure who you're refering to, Ben. I was talking about a specific mechanical effect that I have seen in many games I have played, and which I do know for certain does suck. <br/>
<br/>
Whether or not this effect exists in Iron Heroes, I admitted I don't know right at the beginning of my post. Maybe a token is worth +10 in IH, or it just works some way of which I'm not aware. I dunno. But gambling rare resources that have little potential effect is simply not effective where ever you find it. <br/>
