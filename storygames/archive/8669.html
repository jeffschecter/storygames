Not only for my own group, but folks who show up at local gatherings (local conventions, games people form up at local game stores and so on.)<br/><br/>It took some time, but I attended several local conventions and got to know the people who played the games I liked playing.  By the time I felt I knew enough people to build a group of regular gaming, I had a list that was too long.  Is started going down the list.  When I had three players, I stopped.  If I needed to, I'm pretty sure sure I could put together another group pretty quickly.<br/><br/>One of my players is my best friend in Los Angeles, another writer who years ago did writing for R. Talsorian RPGs.  He stopped playing the games years ago for the same reason I did -- he found the games boring.  He wasn't a part at all of the local gaming scene and knew nothing about what was happening online or with new games. But I talked the games up, and he came with me to one of the conventions.  He played in a terrific game of <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> and a few other games and got hooked.<br/><br/>The other two players I met at conventions.  I loved their excitement for play and I could tell we lined up in terms of what we wanted out of games.  I knew that if they were at my table I'd have a great time.  So I gave them a call and asked if they wanted to play a game of <i>Sorcerer</i>. They said, "Yes."  Bam.  A group.<br/><br/>I would say I'm very lucky in that the local convention scene had two great guys (Paul Tevis and Denys) who did a lot of ground work to make it more convenient to play the kinds of games I liked.  (Quick example: most conventions assume, for whatever reason, that Six Players is the proper amount of Players to have at a game table.  If you submit a game to the convention schedule and say that your cut off for the game is three players, it is assumed you are slacking.  But, of course, if you're Playing <i>HeroQuest</i> in Glorantha or <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> or <i>Pendragon</i> or <i>Gray Ranks</i> with six people the quality of the game can sink fast.  Paul and Denys worked hard to re-work the convention policy so that GMs could determine the ideal cut-off for their games, making the fun-value of each game much easier to maintain.)  In this way, the folks who either wanted to try out new games or wanted to play more-more-more of these games could gather, meet, and exchange contact info.<br/><br/>So, here's the thing, for me, in the context of your post: If I wasn't playing the games I wanted to play (we've got a game of <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> coming up next) I wouldn't play the games.  I wouldn't go retro.  I'd do what I did years ago, which would be find something else to do with my time that I really wanted to do.  <br/><br/>There's not really an "RPG-thing" I want to be doing; there are specific games I like.  I'm either doing that, or something else.  (In the same way, I love <i>Diplomacy</i> and <i>Monopoly</i>, but I have no real desire to play <i>Chutes and Ladders</i>, even though they're all board games.)   <br/><br/>I'm just lucky that there happen to be games I like playing these days.  I'm even luckier that the local convention scene is a hotbed of folks who like these games.  Because, let me be clear about this, I didn't choose people who happened to like the games I liked.  I chose people who, when I played games with them, I really liked playing with -- or, in the case of my friend Eric, someone I just liked being around.<br/><br/>And, also... I only need three other people once a week or so to have the fun... "Ghetto" it may be, but how many people are we really talking?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191737/#Comment_191737" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T18:35:05+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  6:35PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is what people who complain about nobody wanting to play story games should do: recruit non-gamers.

Well, I'm in Malaysia, and there really isn't a tabletop RPG scene here at all. At most it's D&amp;D, because the big book stores stock D&amp;D stuff.<br/><br/>When it comes to getting non-gamer involvement, what I did was basically mine from the non-gaming social circles I am in: gaming is a particularly bad seam to mine, apparently -- try recruiting someone from WoW, and inevitably you'll get "Sorry, cannot play this weekend, got raid. Maybe some other time." Often this means: never.<br/><br/>The problem is that you'll have to do it alone (unless you luck out and find a fellow story-gamer geek. I haven't). And when you've got a job and family obligations to deal with, time is one resource you don't really have to spare, and one others will not be able to spare in abundance. So I find that my tabletop gaming -- not just story-games, but any kind of tabletop gaming -- occurs in spurts, followed by long periods of inactivity. And I cannot rely on people wanting to play what <em>I</em> necessarily want -- obviously less people are interested in, say, IAWA or BW or whatever and will want to play something less intense and demanding.<br/><br/>And when I mean long spurts of inactivity, I mean <em>long</em>. I haven't been able to really story-game at all in 2008, what with multiple major life and family events occurring at the time. And that's fine: I've been too busy, my friends have been too busy. If I want to pick it up I can consider it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191764/#Comment_191764" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T21:24:31+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  9:24PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in Pittsburgh.

For instance, I got a friend of mine, who plays NWN and other computer RPGs to try a game of Sweet Dreams - then my favourite game. He enjoyed it for the most part, but one aspect, the relationships made him really uncomfortable. Having his character set to have a crush on a female character of a male player weirded him out a bit. It's an aspect of play that I enjoy, but I can definitely see how it wouldn't work for others, particularly if you're not sure how far things are supposed to go (ie, who knows if he's heard stories of LARPs ending up with players having sex, I have no idea how common it is, but I have heard of it and it's not something I do, so no reason he might not have either). I only got him to try one session. I suppose I could convince him to try D&amp;D 4e and he'd enjoy it, so in some cases it might be a case of finding the right game. Other people might draw conclusions from just one game, so you'd have to know them well enough to get them to try a game that actually works out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191788/#Comment_191788" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T01:52:15+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  1:52AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 2:00AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I can throw in some second-hand anecdotes from the guy in our gaming group who really loves non-traditional RPGs; he doesn't play them in a regular group (instead getting his non-trad fix at conventions, since our group really never clicked with them), but probably could and would if the week had extra days in it.<br/><br/>When he gets people together to play something like that, he says he tends to draw from two different groups:<br/><br/>1. Non-gamers, ranging from people he works with to relatives to people he meets doing some other hobby (Nanowrimo or whatever).  His pitch for that usually emphasizes "this is a fun creative thing to do for a couple of hours," talking up the story-making part heavily, and generally presenting the whole thing as a "I think you'd have a good time, and hey, it won't take very long" situation, the same way you'd pitch a game of Charades at a party or an impromptu game of cards on a train ride.  He also tends to sell them on a setting or a concept ("Hey, I love <i>Burn Notice</i> too, let's play a game like that!") and keep the focus on that rather than stress the ruleset that they'll be using.  Usually this turns out pretty well for him; I suspect that if he tried, he could assemble a solid weekly group of 4 (meaning people who really enjoy the game and will commit to a weekly session) within a half-dozen sessions or less.  <br/><br/>2. GMs.  At conventions, he tends to zero in on habitual GMs rather than players, and he typically pitches games with shared narrative authority and/or distributed GM roles to them.  He'll emphasize low-prep systems, too.  Basically, he sells them on the idea of getting to have the fun of playing a game while still getting to have some of the fun of being a GM.  Also, he goes after system wonks, wannabe designers, and inveterate tinkerers by emphasizing whatever unusual mechanics a game has.  Again, if he had time in the week to fit in another night of gaming, I bet he could assemble a weekly group of 4 pretty easily there.  To some extent, the other inveterate GMs he knows through conventions practically qualify as a group that meets 5 to 8 times a year.  (I suspect from how he describes those convention games that -- although he hasn't said it -- he likes the non-trad games he plays with other GMs better than he likes the non-trad games he plays with non-gamers, or at least gets stronger and easier buy-in from them and therefore gets to the good stuff that much faster.  Also, I think this only works because he happens to know or meet a lot of other people who tend to GM much more than they play.  If he lived out in the sticks with no other gamers around, this probably wouldn't work out so well for him.)<br/><br/><br/>In both cases, he tends to avoid regular and devoted <i>players</i> of trad games, maybe because he's already getting his fix in that department from our own group, or maybe because the way that games like PTA flopped with us has made him think that it's just easier to look elsewhere, or maybe because he still enjoys getting to be a straight-up traditional GM and doesn't want to give that up.  Which he does in fact enjoy a lot, he is quick to point out.<br/><br/>(As a side note, I should probably point out that if a particular story game stays fairly close to the traditional GM/player arrangement, it generally goes over really well with our group.  It's really only when that division is heavily blurred or entirely removed that half of us -- perhaps predictably, the ones who only like playing and either refused to try GMing a traditional game or tried and hated it -- stop having any fun at all.  And if half of us aren't having any fun, all of us would just as soon play something else.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191798/#Comment_191798" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T04:58:56+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  4:58AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 4:59AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We got involved in a local improvisation troupe, made a bunch of friends, and then asked if anyone was interested in trying roleplaying games.

Actually the opposite: it only has people who like old school gaming AND AT THE SAME TIME like the alternative, people who have never tried old school gaming but have tried and enjoyed the alternative, and people who like old school gaming but have tried the alternative anyway, even if ultimately they didn't like it.  Trust me, my friend is not a suffering story gamer sobbing in the corner because no one wants to play a non-trad game with him: he plays plenty of non-trad games and could easily have a regular non-trad group instead of a trad one.  GMing a trad game isn't a booby prize for him, it's a fun thing he likes to do.  About once a month, he also likes getting people together to play a non-trad game that our regular group wouldn't enjoy, and so he does exactly that.<br/><br/>At least, that was the point I was trying to make for you:  that anyone who thinks that "oh, well, my regular group doesn't like these games, so I guess no one does" is essentially ignoring at least two groups of people who probably would enjoy them.  But, and this is the point my friend wanted me to understand, you really do have to put yourself out there and be willing to hear "no" a lot more than you'll hear "yes," at least until you make enough inroads to be able to get some word-of-mouth going.  (According to him, about half of the people who showed up to play in some story games he was running at a convention a few months back came because people who'd played the year before recommended it to them.)<br/><br/><br/>I'm not sure why you're so fixated on the idea that one can only enjoy non-traditional games OR enjoy traditional games.  Liking one doesn't mean you have to hate the other:  that may be how you feel personally, but that's really just you.  Other people are fine with liking both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191904/#Comment_191904" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T12:17:26+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 12:17PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>Ok JD, in your ongoing group, are there any non-trad storygamers who turn to Old School gaming for the lack of a better alternative?</blockquote>\nI reject "old school" as a category and am coming around to the notion that the category "trad" is horribly malformed and should be rejected as well.

That's what thousands of gamers across the world have been doing successfully since 1970's. That's how tabletop gaming functions as a hobby, not counting some avant-garde movements.<br/>Really? Have you taken into account, say, <i>your own experience</i> as a data point? 'Cause it doesn't sound like it's functioning all that well.<br/><br/>The truth is that long-term campaigns <i>are</i> the avant-garde activity, and occasional standalone game nights are the normal one. It's probably always going to be difficult to find people who are committed enough from the start to our frankly-weird form of gaming to be into a regular campaign. If you want it bad enough, you may have to do what people committed to other avant-garde activities have to do: move to where the others are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191932/#Comment_191932" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T14:02:35+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  2:02PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2009 2:07PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>Interesting.

OF COURSE I look for opportunities to play fun things, whether it's 'trad stuff' or not, because i like having fun.

In my experience, the three ways you can get people to come to the table are:<br/><br/>1. Super-casual social play. Hey, try this thing, it's cool. This one works really well with non-gamers and non-"geeks". The result: an amusing evening of light play of one of the small set of games that support that format. Fun, but rarely results in "recruitment" - at best, tends to make it easier to get a person back for another single-shot. Drawback: few games really shine in this format (or at least, few that tickle my particular fancy), and even the ones that do often don't show off a lot of their coolness on a cold first play-through... which is all you'll usually get.<br/><br/>2. Joe Gamer. Pitch something that people already know and like - this can be either a system "let's play Mutants &amp; Masterminds" or a high-concept "let's play Lost, only in space, with giant robots". I get a random assortment of people, mostly previously geekified, and then go through a period of attrition where people self-select out as the differences between the game on offer and the game in their heads become apparent. If we survive that process, fun will begin. Usually this only sustains a short-run game - the effort/reward ratio is too low for one-shots, and the durability of commitment is too low for a long-running game. D&amp;D is surefire for this, but often comes with an expectation of long-form play that isn't actually sustainable.<br/><br/>3. The "gaming group" - this is the group that plays a little bit of everything. If you have the social capital, you can get just about any short-form game up and going. However, this is usually largely based on social capital rather than genuine engagement with the specific game - so again, games that are off the beaten path don't tend to shine (since people just play them with the same techniques and expectations they bring to every other game). You can ride it out, just like you do with Joe Gamer... but the very fact that the group is not formed around THIS game means that it's usually easier just to move on to the next guy's idea.<br/><br/>In all of these, there's a common difficulty in getting full-play-cycle, engaged play of most "off the beaten path" games. Your casual friends will play anything, but only once. Joe Gamer will play his favorite high concept, in any system - but will struggle mightily to sync up the concept as it exists in his head with concept as it exists in everyone else's head. And "the group" will play anything, but ooh-shiny will move you on before you get too far, and the ingrained social system of the group will usually utterly swamp the game's system.<br/><br/>So I'm largely not trying to play anything other than various flavors of so-called "trad" these days. Coming to the game with that common set of expectations means that we can get to the fun, and that I can recruit from beyond my own immediate social circles with some hope of common expectations/interests. The regular "gaming group" that I'm a part of has a marked preference for longer-format, beer-and-pretzels escapism over just about anything else, so I'm not interested in expending my social capital with them on "weird games" that will not deliver the fun in the expected ways. The other groups that I recruit are single-purpose, recruited for THIS game, this concept - and in general I haven't had a lot of luck with off-beat concepts.<br/><br/>One thing I am less and less interested in is getting to "play" a cool game for just a hint of its play cycle. That always leaves me feeling cheated.<br/><br/>Which brings me around to the original topic, by the way. I expect that the Old School thing is more about low-footprint play than anything else. Everyone I know who's into it is either on a nostalgia trip, actively reactionary against "modern gaming" in general, or just likes that you can just roll some dice and GO, relying on the common D&amp;D culture to make it work.<br/><br/>My Old School tastes are pretty different, and I find them nicely served by 4E - since they're largely about the Gonzo High Weird, not the gritty Dungeon O Doom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191962/#Comment_191962" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T15:33:21+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  3:33PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>Sure, there might be some individuals who genuinely enjoy one-shot play, but it doesn't seem to me it's a particularly popular taste.</blockquote>\nPlaying games at all is not a very popular taste among adults. Those who take a strong liking to games-where-fiction-is-made-that-can-impact-play often want more of them, and often - not always - want to give a story more room than can fit in one night. But <i>we are the weird ones.</i><br/><br/>Keep an eye on the non-gamers you play one-shots with. A few of them will - yes, like mushrooms - pop their heads up and express interest in longer stories. (They may not define "longer" the same way you do, though, so watch for that.) But yeah, the closer you are to where the culture is amenable to these particular mushrooms, the more often they'll come up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_192066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192066/#Comment_192066" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T07:07:13+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  7:07AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 7:15AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (opened a new thread, on modern rpg's and how to attract new players)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192085/#Comment_192085" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T09:24:49+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  9:24AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So did bunnybunny get hacked, or just didn't like the answers he got?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192089/#Comment_192089" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T09:47:15+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  9:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think he reacted to some comments on a different thread from what I can tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192093/#Comment_192093" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T10:19:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2009 10:19AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks to be an example of "rage quit".

Unlike, seemingly, the late OP, I have no problem considering games on their own merit, and setting up a one-shot game for casual gamers or non-gamers. Not only do I not look on that as some kind of lame consolation prize in lieu of "real" gaming, I think it's awesome to see my non-gamer friends being creative and enjoying themselves and making jokes about polyhedral dice. I'm a fan.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ... I do think there is something to be said for having a more engaged, more focused group of "serious" role-players (ie - people who are serious about RPGs, not necessarily people who want to play serious RPGs). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the points about how this would be a rare thing in any sphere of activity, from fly-fishing to poker, are accurate, but still. It's hard to find a group like that, and it really does provide a particular kind of gaming experience that playing one-shots with non-gamers or D&amp;D with a group of casual gamers does not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192284/#Comment_192284" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T11:50:07+00:00" title="February 12, 2009 11:50AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, is this thread dead and buried?
