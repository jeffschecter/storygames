They're really about <i>who</i> the character is. The gunlugger often get all aggressive as a nominal solution because he's got a high Hard. He's got a high Hard because he's the kind of guy who goes all aggressive and tries to take things by force. That's his default position. It's his comfort zone. That's why the highlighted stats get switched out. It encourages the Player to find those moments where her character will be awkward doing something, but will reap rewards for the effort -- because it'll be entertaining. Like any character who tries to solve a problem with tactics out of his or her comfort zone.<br/><br/>So, I don't want to keep the <i>Traveller</i> stats. Because those stats aren't the focus of the game. Because those stats are about the mechanical/physiological interaction of the Character's muscle and bone with the world. And for certain kinds of play (straight up Traveller as OSR) that makes perfect sense. But that wouldn't be this game.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I think in terms of setting, there wold be "The Unit" some kind, defined by the players. It might be a Fire Unit within a larger military unit (but it's the Fire Unit itself that matters, not the Battalion). Or a tramp freighter and it's crew. Or a merc company (and now the focus <i>is</i> on the larger military unit.)<br/><br/>Tensions, borrowed straight out of AW, would be concerns for supplies, equipment, and so on. The community has to work and work together to keep things moving.<br/><br/>Fronts would be the political/economic forces, local and Imperial, pressing on the local star systems, as well as any local problems the Characters end up pissing off (pirates, local nobles, crime lords they crossed while trying to do the right thing, and so on.)<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Thematically it all ties to the the Classic <i>Traveller</i> concerns. Older men, who grew up in the well regulated environment of the military, trained with lots of skills of war, getting dumped out at the edge of civilization. Having seen something very big -- the stars, the civilization spanning light years -- even as their lives are getting smaller. And they're going to have to make something of themselves.<br/><br/>Now what? What will they do with their skills? What will they make of themselves? Who will they be by the time the final bullet hits or they die of old age? What will they do -- one way or another -- to shape, in one small way or another -- the nature of the worlds that they will alight upon?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424114/#Comment_424114" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T00:32:29+00:00" title="November 13, 2013 12:32AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2013 12:50AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Stats were the thing I was stuck on for some time. <br/><br/>Hot to Surety (or some other word for Utter Fucking Confidence) seems like an obvious lateral move. But it wasn't till I sorted out the fictional references that it all came together. It's the magnetism that Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart has. Or my friend who is an Navy SEAL. Something that says, "I got this." At that translates 1:1 to seduction or manipulation -- even if it isn't about being what "Hot" connotes.<br/><br/>But Weird was the hard one. But tonight, looking at the fiction, it's all about Heart. Which <i>is</i> the Weird in this fiction. It's opening yourself up to others, and risking getting zapped completely by something you can't possibly control. When I clicked on that the nature of the Play Books started falling into place fast and I hammered out a rough list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424115/#Comment_424115" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T01:41:47+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  1:41AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm for it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424125/#Comment_424125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T06:38:37+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  6:38AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I like this a lot, but you're right that "Surety" needs a better name; "self-confidence" is a synonym, but "magnetism" sort of works.

What do they ALL need to be to survive and thrive in this world, though each one might instantiate each characteristic differently?"<br/><br/>Bonus trick: the AW stats are so evocative because they're all the same part of speech (they're all adjectives), and they're very tactile---you would use them to describe how something feels when you touch it. They're masterfully crafted metaphors and you won't achieve the same effect by altering the list. Better to come up with your own.<br/><br/>Full disclosure, I've actually never played Traveller! But from your description, and others I've read over the years, I can probably make a guess at what it's like. Let me know if this is right:<br/><br/>+ The characters need to be Cool, because they are steady-handed and level in a crisis;<br/>+ they are Cunning, ever alert to danger and opportunity;<br/>+ they are Glib, roguish and facile in their dealings with others, mostly getting what they want through wit and guile;<br/>+ they are Tough, because they endure discomfort and hardship and that gives them an inner strength.<br/><br/>Use Cool for Act Under Fire, use Cunning for Read a Sitch/Person, use Glib for Persuade/Coerce, use Tough for whatever combat type moves you're using.<br/><br/>If you wanted to play up the difference between solving problems cleverly and understanding how people and the world work generally, you could use Cunning for Read a Sitch and puzzle/situational/tech related moves, and something like Wise for Read a Person and moves related to fellowship, lore, and good judgment.<br/><br/>(Forget about Weird; there's no need for an Open Your Mind basic move and no need for a general Weird stat. Psychics might have it as a special bonus stat which keys into their psychic moves, though!)<br/><br/>Someone with a soldier background would emphasize Cool and Tough; an officer, Cool and Cunning; a scoundrel, Cunning and Glib; a rowdy, Cunning and Tough; etc.<br/><br/>Does this help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424136/#Comment_424136" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T08:46:18+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  8:46AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We'll assume that Surety needs a new word. "Magnetism" is one I tried. Still haven't found it yet.<br/><br/>It's different than Cool. Cool is how one handles oneself under stress. [Blank] is how one handles oneself with other people. That phrasing is something specific to how I see the AW stats. They aren't rods you use to affect the world... they are indicators of your handling <i>yourself</i> in different situations. They point at the <i>Player Character</i>. For "Hot" (or whatever) it's your ability/willingness to put it on, let it show, know what you're doing while being completely authentic and transparent. That's <i>attractive</i>. "Hot," however, keeps connoting for me a kind of People Magazine Hottest of the Year vibe -- glossy and surface and I don't give a fuck.<br/><br/>As for the Weird to Heart, it's vital. <i>Traveller</i>, as it stands through all its iterations does not need it -- and it works fine without it. <i>Traveller</i> as I want it, however, and as it's never been delivered yet (hence a hack!) requires it -- because the setting is being strained through the all the fiction referenced in the original post.

Familiar with it. Saw things that inspired me. Saw things that made me go... Nope. (The thread is also a bit of a bundle to untangle -- as who is doing what and what's being done keeps moving.)<br/><br/>I haven't really articulated the differences to myself -- and, as I said, there's much to be gleaned. But one sharp difference, for me, is a much narrower and more focused MC Agendas and Priciples. The other game seems to be trying to port the whole possible range of Traveller experience into play -- as much as possible keeping as much of the GDW LBB book experience as possible with different resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>But I see the FIRST step of AW play -- or any hack -- as the Agendas and Principles: What is play about? What is this setting about? So, I spent some time thinking -- long before thinking about Attributes and Playbooks, "What is the thing I want? How do I articulate that into Agendas and Primpnciples?"  And once that gelled with real tone and feel and expectations of genre, then I began moving toward the stuff we might consider porting the mechanics. Looking at the Playbooks above, one can see how they aren't very "Traveller" at all. And those that seems easy fits to Traveller shift a bit in light if the others.<br/><br/>In other words, the focus here isn't translating a given game into AW rules (a worthy goal) but coming up with the AW version of this kind of setting and story -- which I see as a different kind of project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424154/#Comment_424154" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T11:48:04+00:00" title="November 13, 2013 11:48AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For stat names, I think something that portrays the grizzled veterans mode of speech is to use body part metaphors.<br/><br/>Hands - Your ability to Act Under Fire and stay steady in a pressure situation.<br/>Balls - Your ability to Go Aggro and Seize By Force and accomplish things through embracing dangerous action.

But I think it can be worded in a way that is more direct. It needs an intriguing noun or adjective that drives it home. AW said "Barf Forth Apocalyptica". DW said "Portray a Fantastic World". Monsterhearts went for relationships instead of setting, which is appropriate, and said "Make the PCs feel unaccepted."<br/><br/>Real, sure. Traveller is the go-to for hard sci fi. But what is the part you REALLY want the GM to emphasize? "Make them feel the vastness of interstellar space" maybe. Or maybe just "Make the players feel small" is more broad - it incorporates both the smallness of a ship in space and of a person compared to an intergalactic empire.<br/><br/>If smallness is not the part you think needs emphasized, that's fine. But "real" just feels like a trap. I think there are more specific things that breed verisimilitude in a story and I'd like to see you express that in the agenda.<br/><br/>Likewise, "compelling" is too little to work with. I mean, it's probably plenty for you, because having played with you as a GM, I have no doubt you could make things compelling just by being reminded to do so. But for me, I need something that's going to help me get from here to there. Something more specific.<br/><br/>I don't know how to word it yet, but maybe it's something like "Put the carrot out there". The characters have drives. They have things they want to do. As a GM, we need to make sure to check in with what those things are and make sure that the ability to get to what they want always feels like it's out there somewhere in the galaxy for them to reach. It needs refinement, but maybe that'll get you closer to expressing something more actionable than just "make their lives compelling".<br/><br/>(Note: I know I'm giving draft notes for a work in progress, not critiquing a finished work. But looking back at my post it seems kind of judge-y.

My bad. <br/><br/>However, I think that's a thing that got refined more and more in the better hacks.<br/><br/>I think Dungeon World, in particular, did a great job of replacing "seem real" and "not boring" with more evocative and actionable replacements.<br/><br/>And "real" has a lot of heavy overtones when applied to Traveller, specifically because of it's hard sci-fi roots. And I think if it's thrown out there too casually, it becomes a trap for "reality lawyering".<br/><br/>Also, your agenda and principles don't address setting specifically, outside of "seem real" (which has as much to do with consequences to actions as it does to setting), because you took out an equivalent of Barf Forth Apocalyptica. Running your agenda and principles as written, I could end up with a sci-fi game that has no sci-fi in it. So I think you need 1 or 2 principles that address setting more explicitly.<br/><br/>And, like I said, "Compelling" may be plenty for you to work with. But for me, it feels more like placing a bar against which to measure my performance (which I feel like I would come up short on, because I don't necessarily know how to get there) instead of an arrow pointing me in a direction that will lead to including better stuff. When DW tells me to fill the characters' lives with adventure, I feel more like I know where to go with that.<br/><br/>I don't know, though. Compelling might be fine. The paragraph telling me how to do that might be all I need to make that a word I can work with. I need some guidance, though, about how to go about making their lives compelling. Maybe tell me how to identify and address character drives, which I think might be an important part of it (but I'm not sure, because that's a part I've never felt competent at doing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424160/#Comment_424160" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T12:52:20+00:00" title="November 13, 2013 12:52PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For <i>Surety</i>, what about <i>Conviction</i>?

To the human heart.<br/><br/>I understand your concerns about the SF confusions that might entail, but I think the tripwire word there might be "accurate." Or "factual." In the context of this part of the discussion, "feel" in the real is I think the operative word. The movies OUTLAND and ALIEN and GRAVITY feel real. Close enough for an SF film.

Instead what are your Basic Moves? Nail those down first and then think about what stats would be used to accomplish them. You don't need to write out the full moves just think about the trigger and what they do like: <br/><br/>When you act under fire or pressure...<br/><br/>Start with the AW moves as they are awesome, but know that they do a certain thing and ask if in Traveler World does combat work like it does in AW?</blockquote>\nSo, when I get some time to work on it, I'll be starting there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
