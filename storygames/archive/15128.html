I started playing them almost as soon as I could read. As I grew from a child into a teenager RPGs became even more fun. I had lots of time to put into my games and my intellectual capacity was increasing, which allowed me to derive a lot more enjoyment from my play sessions. As I grew into an adult and joined the working world (this would be around 2006) I ran headlong into a wall. It was no longer possible for me to keep playing RPGs the way I used to--in fact, I was finding it harder and harder to play them <em>at all</em> anymore.</p>\n<p>The main reasons were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I lacked the time to do the research and setup required to develop interesting fictional worlds and characters.</li>\n<li>On those rare occasions when I did have the time to play, the fun-to-work ratio was not high enough. In short, I wasn't enjoying myself anymore.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I put some serious thought into how RPGs worked to try to figure out what wasn't working for me anymore. Here are some of the issues I came up with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The fictional world must support a group of PCs.</strong> Typically, RPGs are played with 1 GM and 3 or 4 players. Therefore, since each player has one character the fictional world must support stories that can involve more than one main character. Unfortunately, many of history's greatest stories only involve one main character. It's also very common for works of fiction to switch the focus back and forth between different groups of characters. This is very difficult to do in RPGs. Switching the focus around means that some players will actually be playing while others will be left idle for extended periods of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaigns require significant time expenditure for all players</strong> (usually 4-6 hours per week) plus several extra hours per week for the GM. This is not a problem for a child or teenager with lots of free time, but for a working adult those free hours are rare and precious.</li>\n<li><strong>One-shot adventures require even more time expenditure for the GM.</strong> In one-shots an entire story is played through in one sitting. At least for a campaign the different sessions are related to each other and so story material can be reused, and only a part of the story needs to be developed for each session. With one-shots, the stories, characters and even the game rules can differ dramatically from session to session.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaigns require all of the players to attend.</strong> If some of the players miss a session, it can be difficult for the attending players to accomplish their in-game goals and annoying for the absent player to catch up next time. Again, attendance isn't a problem for children and teenagers, but working adults tend to have very busy and inflexible schedules. It can be atrociously difficult to get the same group of 5 working adults together for a 6 hour period on a regular basis. You can mitigate this issue by running the campaign less often, but then a new problem arises: players start forgetting what happened last time. Furthermore, since at every session it's been about 2+ weeks since the players saw each other last, half (or more) of the play time will be spent chatting about real life events. You're still having fun, but at this point the gaming is more of a distraction than a hobby.</li>\n<li><strong>Campaigns are exclusive.</strong> After the first few sessions it can become very difficult for new players to join into an existing campaign. It's also tricky for drop-in friends (who are there just for the weekend, for example) to join in. New players become an annoyance for the existing players since they have to learn the rules, create a character, and learn about what's been going on in the overarching story.</li>\n<li><strong>The story is an emergent property of an RPG.</strong> In other words, the story is generated spontaneously from the player's actions and is not something that's crafted directly. Consequently, it can be hard at times to create a fun story. It's also rarely clear exactly why a particular session went well and another did not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Has anyone else here experienced these issues too?</p>\n<p>With some help from my friend Paul T (who's a regular on this forum AFAIK), I was delighted to learn about the new renaissance of gaming that's going on. New games and new kinds of games are sprouting up like mushrooms. I figured that maybe something there would help me keep gaming and maximize my fun, while cutting down on the time requirement?</p>\n<p>One game that caught my attention was Baron Munchausen (a.k.a. <em>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</em>). It's actually a fairly old game, more of a precursor to the new revolution than strictly a part of it, but it really sparked my imagination. In that game the players would tell tall tales one at a time, around the table. I liked the idea, but wondered if it could be brought even further: what if all the players were creating the <em>same</em> story, and that story could be about <em>anything</em>?</p>\n<p>At the time (again, circa 2006) I didn't know of any game that I really liked that did these two things. So I set about designing such a game with Paul. After about 5 years of working on it, lots of discussion and playtesting, and about 25 (!) different rules iterations (including one premature attempt at publishing 3 years ago), I think that we've finally succeeded at making a game that's really fun and easy to play.</p>\n<p>The game's called Muse, and it's available for free download on the <a href="http://www.benn.ca/muse/" rel="nofollow">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>I welcome your questions or comments!</p>\n<p>--Jonathan</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343888/#Comment_343888" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T18:43:36+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  6:43PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'm gonna give these questions a shot!<br/><br/>There's really not that many options for getting around attendance problems. I'd recommend playing a game that only requires two players and a GM, something that is enjoyable and functional with a small number of players. <br/>There are some games out there that support isolated protagonists - Polaris is one, as is The Questing Beast. Both support "hopping about" between protagonists in different locales, too.<br/>The important thing would be to have players willing to take turns, or in the case of Polaris, you can just give all the players other stuff to do during other people's scenes.<br/><br/>As for GM prep and time expenditure, I gotta say that a lot of games are much more low-prep than you've encountered previously. Fiasco is one such example (character creation is random, then you fill in the blanks), and it's actually designed to be a one-shot, at that!<br/><br/>Player attendance: okay, so Polaris won't work if one of the regulars is missing. But I can recommend Apocalypse World - between sessions, or in place of a session that one PC couldn't attend, the GM (called the MC) can write down little summaries that require a dice roll to see what's been happening to the PC since "last time". Very neat way to wade back into character again!<br/><br/>As for telling fun stories, and having this be a regular occurrence, I would strongly recommend you check out "Story Now" games like Sorcerer, Hero Wars, Polaris, and Apocalypse World. They all tell different sorts of stories, and they all do it in pretty cool ways, some perhaps more familiar to you than others (Hero Wars and Apocalypse World are a bit more run of the mill in how play works, but it works really cool). <br/><br/>I'm gonna check out Muse; you check out some of these games I mentioned!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343893/#Comment_343893" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T20:26:59+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  8:26PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Jon!<br/><br/>Great to see you here on the forum.

You never knew who was going to show up until the game actually started: it was all herding cats all the time, and getting even four people to show up on a regular basis was a minor miracle.  But once we all became working adults and had actual schedules and responsibilities, suddenly getting a regular gaming night going became the easiest thing ever.  People actually know a week or more in advance if they're going to be available on Saturday evening!  When they say they'll show up, they do!  If they're going to be late, they call and let everyone know!  Yay, adults!<br/><br/>On the other hand, we don't do 6-hour (or longer) sessions anymore.  4 hours is pretty much our limit, after that we all turn into pumpkins.  And no one can snarf down entire pizzas and 2-liters of Mountain Dew anymore, either; instead, it's all healthy vegetables and water and things like that.  Still, that's an awfully small price to pay for being able to stick to a goddamn schedule, I think.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343909/#Comment_343909" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T23:57:40+00:00" title="September 24, 2011 11:57PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2011 11:58PM by framweard.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This game gets mentioned a lot, but I'm mentioning it because of personal experience and love for it:<br/><br/>Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>The designer designed it with several of your issues in mind: <br/><br/><b>fun, lightweight prep</b>. In Apocalypse World, the game is very procedural in its prep. You do what the game tells you to do, and nothing else. If you do it as written, you end up doing more thinking about the game than actually hammering out stats and numbers. The game absolutely forbids pre-plotting. You play to find out.<br/><br/><b>easy for players to drop in and out</b>. AW is basically a love-letter to the designers wife, so he made it with her in mind. She's a busy person, so the game had to go on with whoever could make it from session to session. Character creation is easy, the rules are wicked simple and easy to teach (and in fact you don't really have to teach anybody anything, you can just let them learn as they go), and adding new players is only slightly harder than starting a game from scratch (due to a stat that is based on interactions between the PCs; it's no big deal though).<br/><br/><b>the fictional world supports the PCs independent of each other</b>. Fuck yes, AW does this. The PCs can be friends, enemies, acquaintances, whatever. Inevitably they will be drawn to each other though, as they are the badasses of the world. Whether is occasional contact, life-long friendship, or all out war, AW has you covered.<br/><br/><b>The story is an emergent property of an RPG</b>. In AW, there is no plotting. The story comes from the characters and the questions the GM asks them. It's collaborative world-building, and after an initial first-session in which the GM asks the players all kinds of questions and gets an image of the world (and then does about 30m-1hr of prep for the whole campaign), the game takes off on its own. In the words of the game, you 'play to find out'. The game lives up to this style of play; you do almost no prep aside from occasionally writing out a Front sheet (Fronts are groups of threats that are affecting the PCs, or have the potential to affect the PCs).<br/><br/>I just got back from a work party, so I am super drunk. I tried very hard to be coherent in this post, but if you have any questions please feel free to ask. I'm sure the rest of S-G will chime in with their thoughts, too. It's a popular game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is: Apocalypse World is your game.

Out of a 5 hour game, we spent the first 3 hours generating the game world and the Overarching Evil. It was a futuristic world with a cashless economy and where government-licensed super-heroes were the police. The PCs were super-hero-school dropouts eking out a living stealing what they could and living in the less technologically advanced part of town. My character was an evil genius clairvoyant.

Judging by the copyright (2005) it pre-dates Muse by a year, although I didn't learn about it until a year or two ago.</p>\n<p>In the game the players are goblins trying to avoid being killed by their angered overlord by passing the blame for their failed mission onto one of the other players. It has some remarkably similar mechanics to Muse. The players tell a story in turns (like with Muse) and there are cards available for getting your turn early (like in Muse, except <em>Aye, Dark Overlord</em> doesn't use standard playing cards like Muse does). Unlike Muse, there <em>is</em> a GM (somebody plays the Dark Overlord), and the story is really very focused on a particular theme whereas Muse is theme-agnostic.</p>\n<p>One other particular advantage I think Muse has is the use of a Story Sheet to structure the game. A lot of people believe that around-the-table storytelling is impossible to do without creating something very silly, but I think that too much silliness can be avoided by adding sufficient structure to the game. In Muse this is done with the Story Sheet, Question mechanic and Time Outs, whereas in <em>Aye, Dark Overlord</em> they use a very restrictive theme (and probably some other mechanics I don't know about since I only got the chance to glance over the rules).</p>\n<p>--Jonathan</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343921/#Comment_343921" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-25T09:09:46+00:00" title="September 25, 2011  9:09AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes!

This is one of the reasons why card games and miniatures are so popular! Short play time, and/or the ability to add or remove players as the game progresses. Think of Poker for example. Unless it's a tournament, new players can show up anytime. Old players can leave anytime.

"Adventurers", you don't have to worry about shifting focus because most of the time there's a party.<br/>2-3 - Drastically reduced preparation time for the GM. If you want to reduce the time footprint to one encounter and play it on your 50 minute lunch hour, you can (though I don't think that's the ideal way to play).<br/>5 - Again, the "adventuring party" makes non-exclusive campaigns easy.

West Marches seems like a neat idea. However, it doesn't adress several of the issues I brought up, namely <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%236&amp;Mode=like">#6</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It still forces the stories into a party-style format that doesn't match well with most fiction and consequently severely limits play options.</li>\n<li>It does not guarantee that the stories will be fun. What is the characters' motivation for putting themselves in constant danger? Why go to Fort X rather than Cave Y other than simple curiosity? I've played open sandbox video games like Oblivion before, and as vast as the game might be, every cave or castle ends up resembling all the others eventually. The real fun for me in Oblivion was in the storylines.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
