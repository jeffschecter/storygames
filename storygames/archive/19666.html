And haven\u2019t gotten started on using the inspiration rules yet.]<br/><br/>A store here in my city arranged four tables playing the same adventure. The adventure was written by two of the four DMs, who also are somehow affiliated with the store (do they own it?) and they have also written many published adventures for other game systems \u2014 not D&amp;D as far as I know. I\u2019ve read some of the adventures and they have generally been low on player agency and high on \u201cmood\u201d and shock.<br/><br/>I was placed in a group with a DM who was not one of the two who had written the adventure, a nice guy. I kind of didn\u2019t catch his name, though.<br/><br/>Here are some notes on this particular experience, in this particular store this particular day, rather than on 5e in general:<br/>\u2022 We had five custom-made pregens. I liked them all, very happy with mine.<br/>\u2022 They were all level three, which mean a lot of \u201cYour character can do WHAT!?\u201d<br/>\u2022 The inspiration rules sucked. Four of us really played hard to our T/I/B/F:s, constantly doing and saying things by them, and even doing suboptimal things based on them. One of the other players had \u201cI will stop and take notes if I see a demon, rather than running away\u201d and did play to that, at the risk of his character\u2019s life. I wasted healing spells based on my own T/I/B/F:s. Yet we never got any insp. Afterwards I concluded that the DM probably didn\u2019t even know about the insp rule. Even so, I gather that it\u2019s really hard as a DM to keep track of everyones T/I/B/F:s and I think to salvage this rule some sort of protocol is needed, where a player can subtly indicate that they are playing to one of them and wants insp, and the DM can approve or decline. Like tapping with a pencil on the T/I/B/F field, or if you use chips, push the chip forward, I don\u2019t know.<br/>\u2022 The beginning part of the adventure was frustratingly low on things to even do. We started up locked in a prison without our gear and our magic components. \u201cI try to..\u201d \u201cNo, doesn\u2019t work!\u201d \u201cThen I try to...\u201d \u201cNo, doesn\u2019t work!\u201d. Talking to NPCs were met with an immediate \u201cshush, shut up prisoner!\u201d from them. Deus ex machina created a situation where the solution was, which the DM hinted, to look at our components lists and the other caster could use a shoelace to help us escape. Gee, thanks DM.<br/>\u2022 The DM ignored me at first, which felt awful. I was reading through some books we found and he didn\u2019t listen. Later, two other players were like \u201cI take a quick glance at the books\u201d and the DM was like \u201cOH GREAT GUYS, YOU FIND THIS SECRET NOTE!\u201d to them. I was angry at first \u2014 and sulked, thinking \u201cOK, let me know when you want me to do something\u201d \u2014 but then I figured maybe he doesn\u2019t understand my accent or something? Later in the game we found better rapport.<br/>\u2022 I kind of want to record myself DM:ing now so I can become better because I learn a lot on how to DM by seeing other DMs doing things I like and things I don\u2019t like.<br/>\u2022 I\u2019ve had a couple of DMs I really like lately and they have had a DM:ing style that is very brief. We enter a room, they say very few things, we ask questions and explore in dialog. They\u2019re also clear about some of the options players have. I\u2019m trying to emulate that style.<br/>\u2022 This was the opposite, not sure if DM or scenario-as-written but there were a couple of long info dump monologues while also being some situations where it was unclear what we could even do because anything we tried to do was shut down.<br/>\u2022 Instead, I would\u2019ve liked it to be a little: \u201cOK, you are in this prison until [deus ex machina-moment happens]\u201d-time skip.<br/>\u2022 There were also some frustrating party-splits all favoring the sneakers, with the rest of us just waiting until called in like a cavalery. Hard problem to solve and I\u2019ve had the same problem as DM. My two \u201cmodel DMs\u201d try to get a good \u201cmeanwhile\u201d situation going where the two halves of the groups are both doing cool things and constantly switching the spotlight... or perhaps I\u2019ve just been lucky/forward enough to be in the spotlight in split situations in those groups. In which case \u2014 sorry, fellow players!<br/>\u2022 After escaping from the prison we could theoretically go anywhere on the Sword Coast, we walked along the rails \u2014 followed the obvious clues \u2014 for a while. One scenario was a village which we had free hand in how to interact with, which was great. Unfortunately this was the moment of a couple of the longest and boringest party splits, but the set up here was interesting. We could go to any house, talk to anyone. Some fighting, some exploring, some social stuff. This was a node on the rail that was a little bubble of sandboxity. Only one correct way go after that though.<br/>\u2022 In other words: we seemingly had a lot of choices, but only as long as we chose the pre-planned choices. As soon as we wanted to do something else, up came the rails.<br/>\u2022 I suggested ambushing the BBEG outside a treasure hoard he had, but the DMPCs where like \u201cNO WE ARE GOING IN!\u201d<br/>\u2022 The fights: the fights were totally \u201ccombat as art\u201d, combos and set ups and buffs and slots and positioning and opportunity attacks and cover and advantage and resource management and everything. We played completely TotM, no minis, no map of the fighting areas (we had one player facing map of a subset of the Sword Coast, and one of the village) and it\u2019s cool that TotM can handle this style which felt very 3e/4e. And this was with Basic characters.<br/>\u2022 Totally different from my own group of total beginners and level 1 characters, who have already fallen into sort of an OSR style of fleeing and hiding. While I think the 3e/4e superhero characters are fun, I\u2019m concerned that we will lose our OSR-like guerilla tactics. In other words, I like \u201cStep On Up\u201d to be about \u201chow do we take on this place, the dangers there in and the rewards there in\u201d rather than \u201cWe are in a fight, how do we win it\u201d.<br/>\u2022 The DM rolled behind a screen, which I hate. I believe he told the truth most of the time... but... It sucks that untrustworthiness and fudging has infected DMing (in general) so much that this has become an issue. In his favor he trusted our reports on die rolls he couldn\u2019t see from where he sat.<br/>\u2022 We killed the BBEG first and then his two guards, but one of the guards grabbed me as he died and pulled me across a ledge. Then [deus ex machina group] saved me and us and revealed that they would\u2019ve stepped in if we would\u2019ve lost the fight.<br/>\u2022 It was clear that there was a correct ending to the story that we had been striving towards.<br/><br/>Overall, I find that RPGs can fall into one of three categories:<br/><br/>1. Great session, one for the ages<br/>2. Problematic session with lessons for me to think about on how to do things better, as a player and/or DM<br/>3. Horrific session with strong issues raised about limits, veils, triggers or values<br/><br/>This was a category 2 session which means that it was still time better spent than my OOC-life. There were a lot of fun moments. I wish I could be playing D&amp;D all the time instead of living!<br/><br/>ETA:<br/>And biggest take-away for me as DM to try to learn: be brief (keep talking time short) but always be clear about real choices (and be open to players choosing \u201cD. None of the above.\u201d).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436808/#Comment_436808" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T23:18:58+00:00" title="August  9, 2014 11:18PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 11:20PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this.  Every written AP is a category 2 when viewed from the outside.  Great ones and crappy ones, there's stuff to learn from without having been there for the feels.  Video and podcast APs are sometimes useful but not as much as one might hope, because often they're so steeped in parody, side-chatter and ridiculousness it's hard to get through them (this stuff is thankfully left out of written APs).  I know it's an effort writing these things out, but every written AP rises all boats, especially if it includes mechanical critiques or OOC reflections.<br/><br/>As for me, these days I find myself analyzing every game narrative I see in terms of my "Rails" model (working title only), so it's particularly useful for me right now to see examples I can apply it to.  (I also got warm fuzzies when I noticed your allusion to the model.)<br/><br/>Did you hear anything about how the other tables went?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436810/#Comment_436810" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T23:45:55+00:00" title="August  9, 2014 11:45PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 11:48PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great writeup, thanks. I'm also curious to hear about the other tables!<br/><br/>I'm quite fascinated by the "opening" jail-cell scene. It's a scene with literally nothing to do, just created to set the atmosphere before the real action begins (whichever deux ex machina set you free).<br/><br/>I keep wondering what a *good* way to run this scene would be.<br/><br/>Perhaps a simple bit of direction, along the lines of: "We're going to begin with the scene in the jail cell. Your characters are stuck in a hopeless situation, with no way out. What do you do in your downtime, what do you talk about? Who do you think is to blame for you all being stuck here?"<br/><br/>The opening-jail-cell-scene is a fascinating situation, because there are really only two possible ways it can go (Tod's "rails"), at least in your typical D&amp;D adventure: <br/><br/>1. The players are clever and they find a way to escape!<br/><br/>2. The players wait until GM-initiated event changes the situation.<br/><br/>That's a pretty limited palette to play with!

Now, I run with open HP in my game so I appreciated this nugget of info. The other DM also said \u201cThey defeated him quickly even though I used the most leveled version of him\u201d and our DM answered \u201cSame here, I\u2019m also using the most leveled version of him that we prepared\u201d.<br/>Also something I don\u2019t like, enemies changing... but at least the fight, once started, was ran as written. I\u2019ve heard of DMs just putting \u201cThe BBEG has X HP and the fight goes on until I\u2019m tired of it\u201d. Not acceptable to me... This was a <em>tiny</em> bit in that direction \u2014 not as clearly unacceptable.<br/><br/>A player from one of the other tables came over later, we were still fighting the same BBEG, and he said \u201cWow, you\u2019re already there\u201d and we asked him how they had fared, and he said they had quit playing an hour ago, not coming as far in the adventure as we had.<br/><br/>That\u2019s all I know \u2014 maybe other people there read S-G and can post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436815/#Comment_436815" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T00:27:12+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 12:27AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 2:46AM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>1.

You had no clue; you couldn't even play meaningfully.<br/><br/>Second, the GM had already determined who the scene would end, but wasn't able to communicate to you. This is a classic "railroading" situation (ironically, perhaps). The players are sitting at the table and they don't even know what to do, until they magically happen to do the precise thing the GM wanted them to do. When I'm in this situation, I feel like I'm not sure why I'm even at the table: the GM is playing with himself, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436840/#Comment_436840" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T12:00:16+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 12:00PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2014 12:00PM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's why I was interested in the experiences of the other tables.<br/>To try and figure out how much of it was in the module and how much was just the GM you (2097) happened to get.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436843/#Comment_436843" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-10T12:39:58+00:00" title="August 10, 2014 12:39PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point!

And haven\u2019t gotten started on using the inspiration rules yet.]<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>\u2022 The inspiration rules sucked. Four of us really played hard to our T/I/B/F:s, constantly doing and saying things by them, and even doing suboptimal things based on them. One of the other players had \u201cI will stop and take notes if I see a demon, rather than running away\u201d and did play to that, at the risk of his character\u2019s life. I wasted healing spells based on my own T/I/B/F:s. Yet we never got any insp. Afterwards I concluded that the DM probably didn\u2019t even know about the insp rule. Even so, I gather that it\u2019s really hard as a DM to keep track of everyones T/I/B/F:s and I think to salvage this rule some sort of protocol is needed, where a player can subtly indicate that they are playing to one of them and wants insp, and the DM can approve or decline. Like tapping with a pencil on the T/I/B/F field, or if you use chips, push the chip forward, I don\u2019t know.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>This was a category 2 session which means that it was still time better spent than my OOC-life. There were a lot of fun moments. I wish I could be playing D&amp;D all the time instead of living!<br/></blockquote>\nHey! Sounds like you had a bad case of a DM. Keeping the players entertained and engaged should be the foremost goal of any DM, I think. I sympathize with your final remark a lot, so let's take the opportunity to indeed learn more about how to improve our roleplaying.<br/><br/>I've been trying 5e out as a player myself, and I recognise much of the troubles you had (although I'm currently blessed with a great DM, fortunately). The T/I/B/F system is quite nice, and Inspiration streamlines play, imo. It enables roleplaying while it still gives it (manageable) mechanical reward to it. It is terribly heavy on the DM, though (even the good ones). Theres enough for them to take into account already. <br/><br/>What I'd immediately do as a DM myself, is this: allowing <i>other </i>players to signal if a player pushes the T/I/B/F-buttons well. I'd invest them too with the power to give eachother the Inspiration points and take that mandate away from the DM. Firstly, players are more 'into' the game and will notice eachother's roleplaying better than any DM, thus creating a kind of constructive loop. Secondly, by giving players this power, you give them reciprocal responsibility, which will sort itself out in a fair and impartial way, I think. The Inspiration mechanic in itself already presupposes a soft 'roleplaying' element too, so it will be hard to exploit this 'mandate'. <br/><br/>I reckon it will also intensify inter-party-roleplaying, as players will be more on the lookout for eachothers behaviour and will be keener on being noticed in a positive way too. Downtime and playing the T/I/B/F's is a big thing for me too. Of course, if you want to punch things in dungeons, forget about my suggestion. But if you're interested in this kind of 'roleplaying', maybe you can consider trying it out when you DM yourself? (I have no intention at all to master D&amp;D myself). <br/><br/>Keep me in the loop if you do!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437046/#Comment_437046" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-12T09:10:54+00:00" title="August 12, 2014  9:10AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hey!
