(Mechanically, all traits are advantages, since you can always pretend a trait simply isn't there.)<br/>With the infinite variety of things you can write under a trait (including stuff like 'broken arm', 'got humiliated before an entire congregation', 'a nasty scar on my face' etc), I can't see why a player should choose any other option.<br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341615/#Comment_341615" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T11:04:55+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 11:04AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, sometimes a d4 trait just doesn't "feel" right compared to other options.<br/><br/>Also, pretending that you don't have the "broken arm" trait, when you do, especially if it would actually matter in the fiction, is probably bad form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ODDin" title="ODDin"><img alt="ODDin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ODDin">ODDin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341616/#Comment_341616" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T11:10:26+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 11:10AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I say pretend the trait isn't there, I mean mechanically.

It's just that my belief is that any game mechanic should to be built in a way that encourages what it's about and that the choices it creates should be meaningful and interesting. I believe that regardless of the designer's intents, the players WILL maximise their efficiency within the frame of a given design, so I think saying 'you can do it but please don't' is inferior to designing it so that doing it wouldn't be a smart thing, mechanically. Now, I have no problem with having some of the considerations be narrative instead of purely mechanical (and this is where real munchkinism lies - when there ARE narrative drawbacks to a decision, but you simply ignore them), but this isn't the case here, since 90% of the time I think you'd be able to perfectly justify gaining a new d4 trait or relationship, or gaining another d4 in one of your existing d4 traits, as a logical and reasonable result o the conflict.<br/>Plus, it's hardly min/maxing when a game provides me with a clear choice between something that is entirely good for me and something that is entirely bad for me, with little to no in-world difference between them.<br/><br/>P.S. It should be noted that in all other cases DitV does a brilliant job of mechanically encouraging exactly the sort of play it's all about and having the mechanical options also be interesting and meaningful in-world options. Which is why the contrast of this small aspect strikes me so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341626/#Comment_341626" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T12:08:18+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 12:08PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for explaining your position so clearly.

As you say, if the players are focused purely on optimizing success it makes a lot of sense to only choose that option. In practice, I find that the characters are strong enough that another d4 is often negligible, and they sometimes choose the other options when they want to buy off a trait to indicate the direction the character is going or because it makes sense from the fiction.<br/>But basically, it doesn't hurt the game for the players to always pick the obvious choice, but allowing the non-obvious choice sometimes enhances the game when that is what the players want. So it really makes sense to include both options, since there's no reason to discourage players from taking the obvious choice, or to prevent them from taking the non-obvious choice.<br/><br/>Edit: Beaten to the punch by the game designer who I think is saying basically the same thing but more concisely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341634/#Comment_341634" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T12:28:55+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 12:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ODDin, great question.<br/><br/>With Belongings, if you want to min/max, nothing is stopping you. You can describe every Belonging as Big + Powerful. What limits you is the fiction. It's cool to have a Crap gun you've never shot before. It can be incredibly cool to have a Crap coat, especially if everyone else has beautiful coats. The fiction incentivizes creative and varied options. <br/><br/>BUT this isn't quite the case with the D4 Trait / Relationship Fallout options. As a GM, I much more enjoy when a players takes a new D4 Trait or Relationship because they get to write something cool on their character sheet that reminds us what happened in the game. And the D4 Trait / Relationship is mechanically useful. And it can be just as relevant to the fiction in most situations as any other Fallout option. If my Uncle betrayed me in a Conflict, lowering my Uncle's Relationship dice is as fictionally valid as taking a new Trait, "Even blood can betray you." I'd argue that the new Trait is way more interesting. <br/><br/>Often when I see people not taking the D4 Fallout option, it is out of guilt. They feel cheesy... "this is too good, what am I doing wrong." Or sometimes they do it just to show the rest of the group that they aren't a "power gamer", which can be seen as another example of guilt. <br/><br/>There are exceptions. Sometimes lowering a Trait just feels right. It's not rational. I've seen plenty of people do it without hesitation. <br/><br/>Why is Dogs designed this way? I don't know. Maybe it's to tell the player, "I trust you, do what you think makes the most sense."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ODDin" title="ODDin"><img alt="ODDin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ODDin">ODDin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341635/#Comment_341635" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T12:34:11+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 12:34PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess what puzzled me is that it looked like the choices were supposed to be of roughly equivalent value, even though they quite obviously aren't.

A mix of d4 and d6 fallout, heavy on the d4s, is how you get the most and biggest new dice on your character sheet.<br/><br/>So if you're rolling d4s, the best thing to do with them isn't give before you use them, but use them early (supposing the conflict starts with an argument). Collect your fallout before the guns come out, and while you're doing it save some of your big dice for when the fallout can do you real harm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341639/#Comment_341639" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T12:54:25+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 12:54PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 12:55PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Mechanically, the best thing you can do for your character is take the blow pretty often when you're just talking, and regularly but not always when it's physical, not fighting.

Make sure to take relationships with people, places, institutions, and (especially) sins.  If you're getting enough fallout on just talking, you'll get experience fallout every time, too.  This accelerates the process.<br/><br/>So, now that you can jump over to packing a 6d10 Relationship with <i>Wrath</i> inside a couple sessions...  The game still works!  The GM now has the fun of tempting you to use that relationship; after all, chances are when you use it, <i>you're sinning.</i><br/><br/>Good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341645/#Comment_341645" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T13:22:51+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  1:22PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 1:25PM by kobutsu.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Mechanically, the best thing you can do for your character is take the blow pretty often when you're just talking, and regularly but not always when it's physical, not fighting.

What am I missing? It seems to me that taking the blow once when just talking is enough\u20143d4 and you've got a great chance of rolling a 1. (Specifically, about 58%, which reads as good to me. If you want over 80%, my usual "good enough" mark, then take a blow twice, and roll 6d4.) So, why even get any d6es? Unless, when you say this, you're talking about something other than just the chance of rolling 1s. If so, what is it?</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341646/#Comment_341646" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T13:30:21+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  1:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh sure.
