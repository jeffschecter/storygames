E.g. Vincent Baker recently said<br/><br/><i> "The far and beyond number one killer of games is this. You have a vision for what the game is, and you have a vision for how the game's rules work, and they don't go together, and you can't bring yourself to give up either. So you keep trying to mash your square peg of how the game's rules must work into the round hole of what the game must be, for months, then years, and someday when you're bitter and old you throw it away after all."</i><br/><br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/+VincentBaker/posts/9r5zyWUfjgF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/+VincentBaker/posts/9r5zyWUfjgF</a> (I don't know how to link to Gplus comments, but search for "far and" and you'll find it)<br/><br/>Similarly, the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework is all about this, in all games - your Mechanics generate Dynamics which give rise to Aesthetics (player experience). Design is about finding the M and D that give you the A you want.<br/><br/>So, I've made a hierarchy of goals for my game StarCruiser (first playtest session tomorrow). It maps my top-level Aesthetic goals onto subgoals, onto principles for designing the rules, and specific design decisions that meet those goals and principles.

In particular, have you done it in a similarly structured way with this kind of goal decomposition and hierarchy.<br/><br/>If so, what was your experience with it?

You can check out <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" rel="nofollow">this video</a> for a summary. Truth be told, the video says everything that his book will tell you.<br/><br/>There is more that is important than just having your vision of the game to be shown in the game mechanics, but I will leave it to that because that's not what you were asking for. All I can say is that design goals and vision aren't really the same thing in this matter. The vision is something you believe in, where the design goals are something you strive for. It may be semantics, but I think it's important to keep them apart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431662/#Comment_431662" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T10:39:19+00:00" title="April 26, 2014 10:39AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Rickard, will check those out. <br/><br/>Would be interested to hear more about the vision/design goals distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431818/#Comment_431818" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T03:11:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  3:11AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2014 3:25AM by Rickard.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott McCloud suggest six different steps for creating art.  What I find interesting is that he claims that the creator is going from one direction; idea --&gt; surface; where the consumer takes on the product from the other end: surface --&gt; idea.\n<blockquote>Idea/Purpose. /.../ Why are you creating a work of art at all?<br/>Form. What artistic medium will you use to express your message? Oil paints? /.../ Comic books? Games?<br/>Idiom. What McCloud calls idiom is more commonly called genre when referring to games. First-person shooter, real-time strategy, /.../<br/>Structure. In stories, this is the basic plot arc, characters, and other building blocks. In games, we might call this the \u201ccore mechanics\u201d of the game. /.../<br/>Craft. In comic books, this includes how well a story is told. With games, it is the ability to make your rules and play experience streamlined and natural, /.../<br/>Surface. This is the outer-layer experience: the colors, sounds, visuals, beauty, attention to the details that are immediately sensed.<br/></blockquote><a href="http://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/level-6-games-and-art/" rel="nofollow">source</a><br/><br/>I wonder why this topic hasn't got any lift because I think this is really important in game design: it's a foundation of creating anything. I guess it's because people assume the first three steps and kinda skips them by placing them in the backside of their heads, and instead jumps right onto the last three steps. <a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/pubs/MDA.pdf" rel="nofollow">MDA</a> is structure, craft and surface. Not a perfect match but you can see where I'm going.<br/><br/>I dunno if Baker was being poetic when he used the word "vision" and that he actually meant "design goal". For me, I think the following is says it well when it comes to the difference between vision and design goal (<i>Start with WHY</i>, p. 142)\n<blockquote>... there exist a special partnership between WHY and HOW. Bill Gates, for example, may have been the visionary who imagined a world with a PC on every desk, but Paul Allen built the company. /.../ Jobs had the vision, Woz hand the goods. /.../<br/><br/>This relationship starts to clarify the difference between a vision statement and a mission statement in an organization. The vision is the public statement of the founder's intent, WHY the company exist.</blockquote>\nWhile this is about companies, it's also true about their products. A vision (WHY) is achieved by mission/design goals (HOW). Why I think vision is so important to keep separated by design goals is because the vision is what you should tell the consumers, where the design goals are something you can keep to yourself and possibly let the consumer learn by it's own. So I don't fully agree with McCloud's thesis that the consumer of a product will first meet the surface. While that can be true, it's the idea that sells the product in the long run. TiVo had great surface. It had great structure. The product didn't sell that well. Why? Because they didn't gave their vision with the product.<br/><br/>And you need the vision to attract the right target audience; to get people that have the same vision; to get them to show the product for others; to make the ball start rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431837/#Comment_431837" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T11:21:45+00:00" title="April 29, 2014 11:21AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob,<br/>I always design towards a set of goals.<br/>To get these goals, I imagine what a theoretical game session will look like. With place holders for the scene framing, conflict mechanics, etc.<br/>Sometimes those goals are mechanical, like I want the average conflict to last three rounds. Sometimes they are setting oriented, like I want game play to be about movie-style spying (as opposed to the way real spies work). Or sometimes it is about a theme (like temptation).<br/>But when I gather all those requirements together I want it to look like the theoretical game session that launched this design. When evaluating playtest sessions or mechanical flow, I gauge them against both the smaller design goals and this game play model. Then I make changes to get things closer to that model. And as the esteemed Mr. Baker has pointed out, that means that some things have to go. Even if you love them.<br/>I can dive deeper if you like, but that is the overview of my process.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431841/#Comment_431841" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T13:21:14+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  1:21PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2014 2:50PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My answer is no.

If you must plan something, plan the game in your head around the structure of the book which should be in the order that players will face the game while playing. Give them clear procedures to start playing first and setting ideas through the rules, classes and bits of information. Throw all the tables and additional information to the back of the book. Make a clear separate section for the GM if your game uses one and again, give the GM everything in procedural order. It's easier for everyone if you tell the players what to do, before explaining them how should they think in order to play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431938/#Comment_431938" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-01T12:36:14+00:00" title="May  1, 2014 12:36PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I don't even attempt to make any big-picture schematics until I've got large portions of it in already place.

A couple of the revisions were quite subtantial, although e.g. the "Be compatible with adult life" goal was there verbatim in the original (without any the bullets under it).
