Were there other games that inspired you when writing Archipelago?  Have you had a chance to play the game yet?  Are there AP reports in English anywhere that we can read?<br/><br/>I want to play it straight.  I want to hack it into a space opera.  But really...I just love islands.

It must have fallen off the front page while I was in Kyrgyzstan (again). [Oh yes, that's what Ole Peder was saying].<br/><br/>Many years ago (fifteen years?) I designed an Earthsea RPG. My design principle back then was to introduce only those rules that were needed during play. The problem was that I didn't have the toolbox I have now, and "rules" meant only "rolling dice for task resolution, combat and magic". The campaign was fun and poetic at best, but marred by some serious problems: Players didn't have much input on each others' stories if their characters weren't in the same place - and when we experimented with letting players run NPCs on the fly, there were some ugly scenes where one players's character was hosed for no good reason.<br/><br/>I've picked up the idea now and again, but never done much with it - I didn't know how. For some reason (don't remember why) the idea came back, and in a few minutes of inspiration I knew what tools I wanted to use. They were:<br/><br/>- Domains of control. Having a shared background where every player has control of a specific field, such as "culture", "geography" or "magic" would allow players to co-create without stepping on each others' toes.<br/>- Player-owned stories. Each player's story is theirs, and they decide what input other players are allowed to have.<br/>- Destiny points. Each story would move toward certain fixed points, selected/created by the player, but how those points were reached would be up to the player.<br/><br/>(And, of course, I tend to fall back on thoughts from the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3144&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Hippie Method Manifesto</a>, although not intentionally or consciously - the manifesto isn't prescriptive, it's descriptive).<br/><br/>The game in play requires certain improvisational and storytelling skills, but even more a certain <i>attitude</i> of respect for the other players' stories. It's designed to help create subtle and poetic stories - it's a spider web of thin threads, not a steel framework.<br/><br/>I've only played it once. However, I may use it for a campaign I'm planning, called "The Fog Campaign"; it looks like the system will match the group (old friends who have the time to let a story develop) and the setting (pseudo-Japanese poetic action) perfectly.<br/><br/>There are no AP reports that I know of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155786/#Comment_155786" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T08:03:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  8:03AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Matthijs.
