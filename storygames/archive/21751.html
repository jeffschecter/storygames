                    Hello, <br/><br/>I'm looking for some light, casual advice. <br/>I'm starting to run a fairly traditional role-playing game using the system from Over the Edge.<br/>I'm not going to use the setting from OtE, but a made-up one.<br/><br/>There will only be two players, that's including a GM.<br/>Some of play will take place in the modern day, the other part many years before.  Both will take place on a remote island.  <br/>The modern one's a Robinsonade, like the film Castway.  <br/>The other, many years before his arrival, will concern why the island is no longer inhabited.<br/>I'm thinking play will be somewhat sandbox-y, but I'm not quite sure yet?<br/><br/>Any advice or resources you can point me toward?<br/><br/>I might use some crazy I Ching dice stuff to help me think of interesting creative directions to explore.  <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>

                            What if you have one player GM the modern storyline, and then they switch roles for the "past history" storyline? A lot more surprises for each player, and an interesting and challenging form of collaboration.                        </div>

Paul, I would love nothing better than, but my friend is ... he lacks confidence in his abilities.  He thinks that I would be bored, which... I might be?  <br/> </div>

                            I'd encourage you/him to give it a try. Have clear guidelines and method for the GM role in either position, and treat it as a "playtest" (i.e. you don't expect choirs of angels to come down and sing your praises as you play; it's normal and human to make mistakes and struggles while you try this thing out and see if it's any fun).<br/><br/>There are very, very, very few people who are (possibly) legitimately incapable of this kind of thing, in my experience, and they're usually not interested in roleplaying games or anything of the sort.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">@Nathan_H</a> Your proposed game set-up is a interesting one.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> At first glance, your idea seems really cool, but there is a problem if there are only two players.  If player A is the GM for the Before storyline, then he/she will have (meta-)knowledge about the answers to all the historical what- and why-questions when they are a player in the After story-line.  Player B doesn't really have a (pro-)active role as GM in the After story-line because a lot of the decisions have been made in (i.e. will come from) the Before storyline. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how OtE plays, so maybe I am wrong. Perhaps if the After storyline started the game then it would work, but I still feel like it would leave one player/GM with not much to do. If you had more players to split the roles between, or if you split the roles like this like this for two players: player A GM Before, player B GM After, player B GM Before, player A GM After, but I still think there is still the same problem but just drawn out over more game sessions.  <br/><br/>I don't know how much that sense of discovery is important to Nathan's play-style so maybe this isn't an important issue, but the way the game was thumb-nailed, above, it seems like that sense of discovery is an intended part of the design.                        </div>

                            I got that mixed up a bit.  I meant: player A GM After, player B GM Before, player B GM After, player A GM Before.  Still, it only works for four to six sessions before the wheels fall off.                        </div>

                            I'm okay with not having the drawn-out surprises,that are oftentimes in story. <br/>My friend's proponency for this type of play, might be greater than mine?<br/>I'm cool with the amount of surprise that would come from different people having a somewhat equal say into something creative.  I know that rpgs are, story-wise, usually a jumbled mess.  <br/><br/>I see play  existing more in the present, and yes, starting in the present, but I'm not sure either would be that destructive in play.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of your wheels fall off comment.  I mean, being in my forties, four to six times, is about the amount of time I'd want to stick with the same thing anyway.  I don't expect this thing to go on forever, nor do i think that forever-ness is something that should be ideal.                        </div>
