                    Hi all. Just moved from Tokyo to Houston Texas. I have been overseas for about 7 years (not all in Japan). Anyway, just getting back into the swing of things here in the US and looking for a few gamers with similar interest. Last games I played was Polaris (which was rockin'). Very interested in Inspectres, FATE, Spirit of the Century, Burning Wheel and similar. Email is worldstew at hotmail dot com. <br/>
<br/>
I tried findplay - but it looks like no one from Houston has been on for over a year. Again, just trying to find a likeminded group of individuals who like some casual but serious and fun gaming. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers for now,<br/>
<br/>
