Looking for players. Below is a gloss of the rules and the scenario. I ran 150 people through games like this at Gen Con. They play fast are real fun. They let you be very powerful creatively while also letting you sit back and be the audience to the other player's brilliance. <br/><br/>Hope you can play!<br/><br/>Chris Engle<br/><br/><br/>Matrix Game Rules<br/><br/>Here is how to play online...<br/><br/>Pick a character, location or something unknown and say what happens.<br/>There is no order of play. When you have an idea, post it. <br/>You can change what the last player said. Your post over writes theirs.<br/>If you don't like what the last player said you may roll for it. <br/>Roll 2d6, 7+ means it happens and cannot be changed, 6 or less means it does not happen and will not happen in that scene.<br/>You say where people move and what people say. Nothing happens in the game except what you say. <br/>The game ends when the players solve the opening problem.<br/><br/>The player who starts the game is the game host.<br/>The host picks 6 characters, 3 locations and presents the players a problem to solve through play.<br/>The host may veto any action they deem inappropriate. Use this sparingly!<br/>Any player may ask the host to veto something but the host doesn't have to do so.<br/>The host facilitates play. Point out interesting, important points. Encourage. Ask "What happens next?" And wait for the players to answer. <br/>The host is also a player.<br/><br/>The game is a conversation between the players. Check the forum at least once a day and try to limit yourself to only posting a few times a day so no one is left behind. <br/><br/>CTHULHU MADNESSES<br/><br/>"Bad grades at Miskatonic University"<br/><br/>Professor Armitage is holding a colloquium on occult artifacts. A new shipment of dig finds has arrived from Egypt. Something bad is going to happen...<br/><br/>Problem: What terrible thing comes from the artifacts? How will the heroes stop it?<br/><br/>Characters: Professor Armitage, Mary the good Christian girl, Lulu the party girl, Biff the football player, Barney the lab assistant, Karl the janitor, and Professor Brewster the rival.<br/><br/>Locations: The events of the game start in Professor Armitage's archeology lab on the Miskatonic University campus in Arkham MA. Action can go anywhere else the players like but Armitage's home and the Soda Fountain/Pharmacy are two other important locations.<br/><br/>Setting: The game is set on a US college campus in 1928. <br/><br/>Opening scene: Professor Armitage and the kids are working in his lab late Friday night. They are inventorying the new artifacts. Biff holds up a sparkling scarab. It gives him a woosie feeling. "Hey Professor, what is this?"<br/><br/>Now as game host I put it to you, "What happens next?"<br/><br/><a href="http://gamersplane.com/forums/thread/840/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gamersplane.com/forums/thread/840/</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
