We always started with already "established" vampires (havens and all), which in retrospect kinda sucked (sic). Especially since the group was never very keen on threatening that establishment. Not something I'd like to revisit, personally, but whatever.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been thinking and the book (if I remember correctly) opens with the story of someone who had just been turned into a vampire. And when I remembered that I slapped my forehead and said: "that's actually an awesome kicker!" It's really such an obvious thing I'm surprised I had not considered it before. And I don't know of anyone who has done it either.<br/><br/>"Ok you wake up and you're a vampire now, what do you do?" How do you deal with the fact that your phone is constantly ringing, and your mother is going crazy because you didn't come back from the party, and your boyfriend is god knows where, and holy shit you can't go in the sun anymore. All that stuff. And now there's this whole new world you don't know and new "people" you need to know and fear.<br/><br/>So, yeah, starting play with the actual event of being turned (or shortly before). Did anyone ever do that? Because I'm not familiar with any accounts of games like that (and we certainly didn't do it ourselves).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360853/#Comment_360853" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T13:09:16+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  1:09PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weren't you supposed to roleplay out a prelude of sorts with each character, touching directly on this?

Want to do anything about it?" To really drive home the basics about vampiric existence.<br/><br/>I'd be tempted to do THAT, and then flashback to the embrace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360884/#Comment_360884" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T14:58:51+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  2:58PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done it a few times.

It was by far the most interesting, if rather short lived.  I learned that people who didn't come out of D&amp;D or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles didn't think of giving an average person who became a vampire any real combat skils. So, when I introduced a vampire hunter it was <i>fucking terrifying</i>.  Other things that completely weirded them out, the Prince offering a goblet of his blood, their sire playing politics with them (they were siblings in that way, and unauthorized).  We only played a couple of sessions, largely due to the disconnect of me unable to think of a plot that didn't involve fighting, and them having made characters who did not fight. Before that, we got into a lot of "This is your life now. What next?" And we touched upon things like, how do you keep your job and what do you tell your family, etc.<br/><br/>Another game was a dark ages game that began with the sire embracing the childe.  A few sessions in, the sire was killed by enemies, and things really got heated up. This was a one-on-one game with my college roommate. Because we played through the embrace, the connection to the sire was stronger than I think it would have been otherwise. In games I've played since, the sire is often barely more than a background note.<br/><br/>Both of these games were also introductions of Vampire to the players. So a lot of the ignorance of how things work was played to full effect.  I know personally, as I played more of it, I grew less interested in starting out with the embrace because it had already been done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360939/#Comment_360939" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T18:32:47+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  6:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>We've always played it with humans, and then slowly introduced the Vampires/Mages/whatever during the first few sessions.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, I've never played Vampire, but the one Mage campaign I played in started with the Awakening, and it was a really great way to kick off a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360965/#Comment_360965" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T20:57:13+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  8:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the Vampire games I've run, started with the mortals, and then hit the embrace after the second or third game.<br/><br/>It's always better to establish some context.<br/><br/>I ran a great True Black Hand game once, where the characters competed in various pursuits for the right to be embraced by members of a clan of their choice after learning all about the various clans/bloodlines/etc. Those characters who did exceptionally well in these ordeals, earned the right to be embraced by higher generation vampires.<br/><br/>That was a fun chronicle while it lasted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360973/#Comment_360973" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T21:21:49+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  9:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>Weren't you supposed to roleplay out a prelude of sorts with each character, touching directly on this?</blockquote>\nYeah.  I played in at least one, maybe two Vampire games that did that.<br/><br/>It was okay.  Not transcendent, not groundbreaking, not even great.  Kind of fun for what it was, but -- because neither of those campaigns were about dealing with suddenly being turned into a vampire -- it felt a little like padding you had to get through before you could play the actual game.  It's not a good idea for every game of Vampire, is what I'm trying to get at: if your game is going to be about something else (politics, history, action, revenge, love, whatever), then you'll likely get more mileage out of jumping straight into that rather than running around doing the "OMG we're all vampires now, how does that even work" routine.<br/><br/>Generally, I'm in the camp that says you shouldn't put off the "good part" of a game too long.  If your game is about something -- and a good Vampire game should be, if only to avoid the goth superhero cliche -- then everyone should be pushing to bring that something into center stage as soon as possible.  That way, when you bring in whatever other minor themes you want to play with (the unbearable angst of vampiric existence or what have you), it can immediately be put into the context of what the game is mainly about and not just devolve into directionless wankery.  So if you want to run a game that's specifically about being turned into a vampire and figuring out how that even works, then yeah, absolutely that's where your game should start: jump right in with both feet, night one of their undeath, and watch the fireworks.  Other campaigns about other things should start in other places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361063/#Comment_361063" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T06:59:49+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  6:59AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>Most of the Vampire games I've run, started with the mortals, and then hit the embrace after the second or third game.</blockquote>\nThis is the typical timeline for human to vamp ratio in games that I've played.

The concept was that there was a traitor in the Sabbat who'd given vital information on the sect operations and locations within the city to the Camarilla. The Sabbat elders had discovered the leak, but rather than scramble around trying to defend themselves from the incipient Camarilla assault, they decided to withdraw from the city, and attack a Camarilla stronghold elsewhere. The other portion of the plan was to leave a single Sabbat pack, newly embraced, that the Camarilla wouldn't know about, to disrupt Camarilla operations once the Sabbat had withdrawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first chapter was all about them trying to prove themselves as Full Sabbat before the withdrawal. They weren't given any guidance whatsoever, other than that if they failed, they'd be destroyed when the Sabbat withdrew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also played through all of their preludes, to greater or lesser extents. Once or twice, I think I may even have done a joint prelude, but for the most part, it was one on one, outside of the normal sessions of play. The only prelude I didn't do was my main player, who was the largest motivation for getting the game going in the first place. He'd actually been so eager to get started that he allowed one of the other players, an experienced GM, run it for him. I was kinda miffed by that, but I let it stand after they described it to me, as it was probably more depraved than I could have managed, and I kind of proudly confess to some doozies with the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the game where my group was very much in flux over the life of the chronicle, so I did a lot of preludes over the year or so that the game ran, probably close to 20. I also had, just as a fond reminiscence tossed on at the end, an absolutely outstanding Malkavian, a Clan I was always leery about letting people play, because people usually used it as an excuse to act retarded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361809/#Comment_361809" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T14:00:56+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  2:00PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2012 2:03PM by ccreitz.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>I also had, just as a fond reminiscence tossed on at the end, an absolutely outstanding Malkavian, a Clan I was always leery about letting people play, because [...] </blockquote> I felt the same way until I played one, and had a great experience trying to play a character who was believably paranoid schizophrenic, instead of a wacky fish slapper.
