Incluing site analysis, putting ads on my site, all that.  And I thought, hell, why not put twenty bucks down and see how advertising works?  I don't actually have some pressing need for traffic, but paying twenty buck to mess around with some heavy power tools strikes me as good times.<br/><br/>So here's the fun thing.  You set keywords, and bids - and you see if your bid is enough to advertise "on" that keyword, as compared to others.<br/><br/>I put down 15 cents as my bid, and threw in some keywords that seemed to suit my site.  Then I stopped, and wondered "Hey, how much are these other keywords worth?"<br/><br/>15 cents is enough for a click on "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" right now.  And a whole host of other stuff that's much more site-specific to me (which is boring, so I'll leave it off).  It is <i>not enough</i> for a click on the following: "Spirit of the Century", "Minds Eye Theatre", Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay", or "Greg Stolze"<br/><br/>It is enough for "Castle Falkenstein" and "Amber Diceless".<br/><br/>Anything else I should try out?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237995/#Comment_237995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-17T17:00:02+00:00" title="October 17, 2009  5:00PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2009 5:00PM by PaulCzege.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting.

When choosing your Adwords try to be specific, kind of how you would if you were searching for something using Google's search engine, i.e. placing words in quotes helps a bundle. Use words that are relevant to what you think your customer wants and make sure that those words are keywords on your landing page. This means don't use Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a search unless the page the advert is linked to says something about Dungeon's &amp; Dragons. The cost of the advert is based on two things: how much other people are willing to bid and relevance. Get the relevance part right and you're winning half the battle. Oh and use lots of these lovely search terms at the start of your campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother aspect of relevance is the words you choose for your advert. You're going to want to run multiple adverts. Ideally when you begin your campaign, you'll have a few adverts for each landing page (remembering to keep the searches you use relevant to the pages that each advert is linked). The wording of each advert should be relevant to its landing page and the words you used to make it show up in the first place. Which brings us back to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons thing again. If you don't have it on the landing page or as one of the words used to make your advert appear, don't use it now. In fact, forget about using it all. The space on your advert needs to catch people's attention and call for them to click on it, but it also needs to be seen. Keeping your wording relevant will help your advert appear on page one instead of page ten. Another way to keep your advert near the top is to choose the option allowing it to only appear in the top five placements. I recommend doing both of these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said you should be running multiple adverts with an excess of search terms for one simple reason: research. After a while, you're going to have lots of information. You'll know which wording gives you the most clicks, which searches are calling up you adverts the most, and how to make your campaign more cost effective... blah blah blah. Keep collecting that information for about three months (bearing in mind that months like December might really fuck around with the results) then prune away all the shit that isn't working and I mean everything. When your three months is over, you should be running a sleek advertising campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing, some people will say that paying for clicks is better than paying for impressions. I kind of agree, but that doesn't make impressions without clicks, worthless. You can't click on a television advert, radio advert, magazine advert, etc. but companies still pay large amounts of money for them. The reasons for this should be obvious. Even if someone isn't clicking on your advert, it still needs to make a lasting impression. Your impressions should make an impression!!! No need to thank me for that pun. Whether you bet on clicks or impressions, always keep your eyes on the click-through-rate. That's the thing telling you the percentage of clicks your getting for all those impressions your adverts have received.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how good your campaign happens to be, familiarity creeps in and this is both good (recognition) and bad (people stop looking at your adverts). The trick is to keep it going long enough to make the thing your selling recognisable, but be willing to adapt your campaign before people stop paying attention to it. That means keeping an eye on your campaign and looking for signs that things are in decline. This doesn't mean that you delete everything and start again just because you get one bad month. You look for long term trends and when you spot them, you take action. And that means starting the whole process over again, but this time with the added advantage of having lots of delicious information to help you decide what changes to make. However, be aware that just because something didn't work last time that doesn't mean it won't work for your updated campaign. People change and so should your campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother one more thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can tell you what will work for your campaign. Advertising is lot of guesswork followed by a lot of research followed up by a lot of muddled interpretations of that research that is probable out of date anyway and when by some stroke of luck, people like me do get it right, we tend to be obnoxiously self-congratulatory. Conversely when we screw up, we tend to blame everyone but ourselves. Its the markets fault or the economies fault or the fault of a rival advertising campaign. Anything so long as its not our fault. The truth is that our successes are less a result of what we consciously do and our failure are more our responsibility than we would like to admit. So what does this mean to you? It means not worrying too much. It means be patient. It means not checking how your adverts are doing every day and making changes all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last one more thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't forget to place your adverts on websites that are relevant to what your selling as well as on Google's pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very last one more thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can use Google Adwords for text banners and image banners. I recommend starting with text banners and a small budget before throwing money and time into image banners. If you're making an image banner, I might be of some help, but I'll leave that for another discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Interesting, that.<br><br>51% isn't a terrible bounce rate as long as you're getting enough click-throughs. Even the best sites can have high bounce rates and just because someone feels that your site isn't right for them, that doesn't mean they won't think that is isn't right for someone else that they know. <br><br>You can help your bounce rate by making sure that what your advert says matches the content of the landing page. One reason people don't like Evony's campaign isn't because its focuses on sex, but because they feel they are being mislead. Another thing that will help is making sure you choose the right landing pages. I've seen campaigns failing simply because the wrong landing page is chosen. Your landing page should be doing the job of informing your customer about your products, giving them choices which are quick and easy to make, giving them a reason to return in the future and reasons to tell other people about your site.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238066/#Comment_238066" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T15:43:48+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  3:43PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.<br><br>Marcus, that's some hugely good stuff.

I have an unhealthy addiction to Analytics, and do some very, very deep customization whenever I set it up for a client site.<br><br>Perhaps the single most useful thing to set up is one or more Goals -- that is, actual events on the site you care about. Typically this is stuff like "downloaded a PDF" or "submitted a form" or "bought a widget." Stuff like that. You can also set up a "funnel," which is a series of pages the users need to work through to complete the conversion. Once you have all that data, you can see at what point in the funnel folks bail out, and then go back and start patching those holes.<br><br>Really there are books and blogs and forums and all the rest of the Analytics support community, which bears some strong resemblances to the indie gaming community. Huge amount of data. Luckily, just setting up Analytics all by its lonesome is easy to do.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238162/#Comment_238162" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T10:37:29+00:00" title="October 19, 2009 10:37AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those that use Analytics, do you track accesses made to files that don't allow embedding of the JavaScript needed to detect their access (e.g. jpg, pdf, etc.)?
