The guys I play with are nice and all, and theyre up for almost anything and like trying out new games, but their approach to the games is always the same. They make one-dimensional characters geared towards some form of action (not neccessarily physical action), and even though they often have good character concepts they never show any interest in pursuing or exploring their characters. They arent really interested in story, in any shape or form. <br/><br/>And thats cool, I mean, who am I to judge them or their preferences? They game to look cool, to do stupid stuff, to be violent, to pretend to be stone-faced killers and ice-cold cool guys, in essence 80s action heroes. So when we game I try and cater to their wants, while at the same time injecting a little story in there so I feel satisfied. I try to explore themes, I present them with moral dilemmas in between the car-chases and gunfights and ridiculous ideas, I do the best I can with what Ive got to ensure that we all have a good time. And we do. Most of the time, we do. We had a blast playing Dont Rest Your Head yesterday, for example, mostly because we made it into a John Woo film.<br/><br/>But sometimes I just want to shake them. Sometimes I get so frustrate I consider throwing in the towel for a while, because I cant find anybody near me who wants the same out of their roleplaying that I do.<br/><br/>I mean, why arent they interested? Why dont they think exploring these stories is cool? I know they like good movies, one of them is a diehard Godfather fan. Good storytelling is practically universal, right? So why dont these people want to do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106501/#Comment_106501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T08:23:07+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  8:23AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BD?

You know that, but repetition on this point is important. Explaining *exactly* what you're yearning for might get you a couple of sessions, but it probably won't.<br/><br/>Second, since you can't change your current group, look for new gamers with those tastes. Try an online game. Do the old fashioned "note on the FLGS bulletin board" trick.<br/><br/>Third, if you're brave, try to *make* new gamers. Recruit some non-gamer friends, combine the gaming with a dinner party, or look for potential in the local theater scene.<br/><br/>Finally, if you've exhausted all advice, remember: there's always conventions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106521/#Comment_106521" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T09:58:17+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  9:58AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have fun, but its not the kind of fun I want to have.

Some people play for wish-fulfillment - as you said, to be 80s action hero badasses. This is cool and fun and rocks my socks. <br/><br/>However, it is pretty much completely incompatible with "story" in the sense of genuine tests of character. The action hero is always the same. They don't change, except perhaps to get cooler. The story of the action hero is <b>how</b> they are cool. The story of the protagonist is in the "agon" part of that word. They struggle. They might fail. They change or define their character through struggle.<br/><br/>If your group is into being action heroes, chances are they aren't <b>ever</b> likely to want to play games where they don't get to automatically be cool and show off. They <b>may</b> be willing to play games where they chew scenery a bit in between action-heroing (your Woo-esque DRYH game probably falls into that zone).<br/><br/>You can't sneak up on mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106527/#Comment_106527" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T11:14:49+00:00" title="November  4, 2007 11:14AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theres one thing thats bugging me: I dont actually understand what it is that they want. <br/>I mean, its easy for me to say that they want to be cool, and MArk Ws post helps put it into perspective, but I still dont quite get it.<br/><br/>One of the guys is a good roleplayer. He identifies with his characters and he has lots of good ideas. But he doesnt care about how his character feels, or what goes on inside them.

His favourite rpg of all time: RIFTS.

I mean, I dont fully master all the techniques and stuff, but I understand it! It feels right!<br/>I had thought that this was a universal thing, that it was just a matter of shifting perspective. I guess I thought that when I intrduced this kind of gaming to people theyd sort of go "Oh. Hmm.. Well, I guess we can play it like that too! It sounds like fun!" Instead, they dont see it. They dont see what powerful tools these games are, they just see dice and combat traits and ways to kill imaginary people and pretend to be awesome.<br/><br/>I just dont get it, thats my biggest problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106540/#Comment_106540" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T12:03:12+00:00" title="November  4, 2007 12:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read recently that there are only two reasons why people don't change their behavior:<br/>- they don't think the change is worth it<br/>- they don't think they can make the change<br/><br/>This sounds more like the first one to me.  They don't see any thing fundamentally different about these other games, so they don't see any rationale for changing.

Make it clear that it's something different, not a substitute for the regular game. Make it clear that only those interested need show up--it's not a "group thing". Maybe involve some different people, like other gamers or non-gamer friends. Try a game that _can't_ be played the way you, as a group, play your regular game, like a pure storytelling game as opposed to a role-playing game. <br/><br/>See what happens. <br/><br/>(Of course, I've only done this once or twice, and it always went well.

That's not "sneaking up" on anything, it's wandering around until you hit your groove. "Sneaking up" is when 1 player has a place in mind they want to go, and tries to get there by a gradual, often covert, process of drift. That trick never works.<br/><br/>That the range of common play styles is so truncated may be one reason why so few gamers "stick with the hobby", and why those that do are "gamers."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106566/#Comment_106566" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T14:12:19+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:12PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2007 2:13PM by Temple.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>That the range of common play styles is so truncated may be one reason why so few gamers "stick with the hobby", and why those that do are "gamers."</blockquote>\nThat sounded like a hammer hitting a nailon the head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106568/#Comment_106568" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T14:17:32+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:17PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story gaming is, for the moment at least, kind of culturally rarefied - not quite like, say, modern dance, but just as hard to find a community for outside of major urban centers, and for some similar reasons..

As Ive been saying, Im not dissatisfied or anything, Im just not getting what I feel like I could have been getting.<br/><br/>As for your questions:<br/><br/>They are not really uncomfortable with taking control, but its hard for them. I try to give them as much control as they are willing to take, but most of the time that means I narrate and they react to my narration. Whenever I ask them directly to take control they do it, and even enjoy it, but I cant seem to get them to want to do it on their own.<br/><br/>Their answers to the questionaires left me wanting. They didnt use it like I explained to them was most beneficial (using it like an indicator to me of what they wanted to happen in play). Instead they gave srt of bland answers, didnt involve any NPCs, made sure their characters were without family and cut off from the world and generally made trenchcoated, sunglassed lone wolves ready to take ass, kick names and chew bubblegum.<br/><br/>They are actually open to trying practically whatever I suggest, which is cool! Weve played Poisond and Dogs in the Vineyard already, and we had a similiarly awesome time with those games (that is, they made the same kinds of characters and showed a similiar disinterest in exploring the deeper issues of the games). We had some awesome scenes, but I suspect that the awesome I saw in them was very different form the awesome they found.<br/>Like in Poisond we had this fantastic scene where two player character pirates got into a fist-fight over who would get to rape the terrified native girl lying at their feet. And after the winner was done and left, the loser came back and smashed the poor girls face in!<br/>To me, that was awesome for the gruesome, bone-chilling reality of what just went down, and the way it showcased the emotional state of the pirates.<br/>I suspect, though I cant know for sure because they didnt talk much about it beyond aghreeing that it was indeed awesome, that they thought it was cool because it was a fist-fight, followed by rape and then more violence. In other words, I saw something mature where they found only juvenile entertainment. But thats, as I said, only a theory.<br/><br/>So its not really what they will and will not play, its how they play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106579/#Comment_106579" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T14:47:51+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:47PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2007 2:49PM by Temple.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was whispered to me, but I thought Id answer it in public:\n<blockquote>What are you thinking about doing?

I still recommend patience and guidance. The kind of gaming you want is a learned skill, even for folks who want to learn it.<br/><br/>If you lived in a larger city, you could form a new group of gamers that were on the same page, which would be ideal. Then you could go see movies and eat pizza with these folks and play the games you want with the others. But, since you seem to be having some fun, I'd cautiously explore things. DitV is a tough one to start with. There is no mechanical restraint on twinking out your character. There is no mechanical requirement to take relationships with NPCs. But that's where (I think) all the fun is to be found. <br/><br/>You asked for advice on how to handle things personally. But your players seem open to trying whatever you suggest. Here's the mean GM trick I would do to them (I'm not suggesting this is the right thing to do. Just what I know I would do in the same situation. So, don't blame me. I don't condone my own actions. Sometimes I can't help myself) We're about to play DitV and they're making up some bland, unconnected characters and giving me nothing to play with. Since they seem open to stuff, I would probably have just asked one of them "Tell me about your brother?" And then said "Hey, you know you get a free d6 relationship with any blood relations. You should write him down. Want to use some of those relationship dice to strengthen your ties to your brother? Don't know if you might meet him on the road." I would have turned to another character and said "Hey, what if your mother had an affair with his brother? Is that cool with everyone? You should write down a relationship with his brother too. How mad are you? Maybe add some dice for that. Oh, don't forget to take some dice for your mom." Stuff like that. Then I would have walked them into their home town and let the chips fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106585/#Comment_106585" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T15:07:31+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  3:07PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't really explain this reaction, but suddenly I'm thinking you should try Capes with them next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106587/#Comment_106587" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T15:38:14+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  3:38PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>I think you can indeed "sneak up" on this.

That's not "sneaking up" on anything, it's wandering around until you hit your groove. "Sneaking up" is when 1 player has a place in mind they want to go, and tries to get there by a gradual, often covert, process of drift. That trick never works.<br/><br/>That the range of common play styles is so truncated may be one reason why so few gamers "stick with the hobby", and why those that do are "gamers."<br/><br/>Wow. Way to pummel the strawman by way of absurdly extending an informal quip.<br/><br/>Frankly, Temple, if you agree with this, I suggest you abandon your group, as it means you have little respect for the other players. You think they're dumb or narrowminded, and that they lack the dynamic, creative faculties every successful group I've ever seen has. <br/><br/>God, gamers with scare quotes attached. I can almost *taste* people wnting to whip out the brain damage and spousal abuse metaphors that are held back by the thin pretense required to sell your corner of the hobby. It's just so . . .

When I first came here, I thought that I'd have no one to play with.  I resigned myself to a year or two without roleplaying.  Then I started reading about some story-games, and got really excited about them, and I was like "Great! Now even if I find some gamers, chances are they won't want to play the same games I do".<br/><br/>Last night we had a game of The Mountain Witch which was one of the best roleplaying experiences I've ever had.  It was amazing.  I also play a regular session of Sorcerer, which is a little more hit-and-miss, but has produced some pretty wicked fun.<br/><br/>What happened? I stopped thinking in terms of gamers and non-gamers, and started thinking about people who I enjoy spending time with.  Granted, not everyone was interested, and there was some awkwardness about it, but I've got a regular gaming group for Sorceror, and a larger group for one-shots, and it's working out great.  I think there's kind of a tendancy to think of gaming as this kind of cultish thing, where only initiates will be able to understand it, and that getting someone into gaming means changing who they are.  Presented like that, gaming is a pretty hard sell.  With some story games though, especially for friends who are aspiring writers or film-buffs, "Let's get together and tell a story about X" is a pretty easy thing to say.<br/><br/>There's a chance that your friends will start to enjoy different ways of playing, but to try to force that on them is never going to work (as you know).  Keep trying new games, because it seems like that's a good way to increase your own fun, while making sure they have a good time too.  But really, I think that your best bet is to try to run some one-shots for your other friends, using some different games, and see what comes of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106593/#Comment_106593" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T15:59:31+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  3:59PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whatever imaginary battles Malcolm may be fighting, I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting something different than the other people you play with. It may limit your options, but that process of either adjusting your preferences or finding some new people to play with is how successful groups form (by definition: groups that can't do that aren't successful).<br/><br/>For those who aren't fighting the hobgoblins, "gamers" refers to the stereotypical fannish, action-adventure, predominantly-male, poor-social-skills popular conception of what a gamer is. If I'd used the word <b>without</b> the scare quotes, I really <b>would</b> be misrepresenting what a gamer is. It's a selection problem - the majority of players and published games and RPG culture is focused on a particular narrow subset of "how to play, and why it's fun" - the adventure-gaming, fantastic, wish-fulfillment subset. <br/><br/>If what you're interested in doing with the medium doesn't fall into that subset, you can either adapt (and become another "gamer" to a greater or lesser degree), drop out (this isn't for me, I'll go do something else), or (if you're fortunate) manage to collect a critical mass of others who also fall outside the dominant gaming culture (and become "those weirdo story-games people", or "those weirdo online-rp-ers", or "those weirdo boffer people"... aka "Not A RPG" in flamewars across the internet).<br/><br/>There's no conspiracy, no philistinism, no failure of design or imagination. Just an accident of history and arguably a market failure that's resulted in a narrow gaming culture. Which - like geek cultures everywhere - is insanely defensive when anyone decides it's not for them.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone but Malcolm (by indirectly attributing it to me) has brought any suggestion into this that Temple's fellow players are bad, "brain-damaged", lesser, uncool, "abusive" or anything of the sort. They just don't find the things Temple has the most fun with to be fun for them. He can either try to show them his fun and see if they like it (which it seems like he has done), or he can get his fun elsewhere, or he can try to have their kind of fun since that's what's on offer. No value judgments at all. Just a choice to make.<br/><br/>I've got no axe to grind with the main line of gaming culture. I just think there's a lot of territory left fallow by it, and some of that territory is much more interesting to me than the current adventure-gaming-dominated style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106605/#Comment_106605" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T17:25:12+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  5:25PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2007 11:17AM by Andy.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>cite&gt;Posted By: Mark WI've got no axe to grind with the main line of gaming culture.</blockquote>\n*cough*\n<blockquote>For those who aren't fighting the hobgoblins, "gamers" refers to the stereotypical fannish, action-adventure, predominantly-male, poor-social-skills popular conception of what a gamer is. <br/></blockquote>\nThis is why your affected tolerance isn't fooling anyone. This is why your community is shat on. You are not victims of a baseless smear campaign. You are, it seems, merely not conscious of the level of apparent contempt in your statements, and how it affects your approach to the community.<br/><br/>The flexibility I assume in others and have observed on countless occasions is not something I extend by being extra charitable. It's something I extend to ordinary human beings by virtue of their existence. If you cannot marshal this basic respect for others within the hobby, then leave it. The value you assign to the average gamer means that it's not only undesireable for you to game with them, but even more undesireable for them to game with you.<br/><br/>In the context of this discussion: Honestly expressing your interests isn't a trust thing. It's part of the basic respect the group is entitled to. If that respect isn't there, then it's pointless to play any game with the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106607/#Comment_106607" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T17:56:41+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  5:56PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm out.

Maybe this is what leads people to deny that anything other than what they already do can be fun, I don't know.  Somehow this seems like a better metaphor for the inability to see that there are other possibilities than other more loaded imagery.  I say that because BD is pretty much permanent and thus not very representative of the situation, but you <i>can</i> climb your way out of a rut.  And I've seen people do it.  It doesn't really matter what you're used to, be it D&amp;D or Storyteller or DitV - if you can only conceive of one kind of play, you're missing out on a chance to find new fun and so are the people you play with.<br/><br/>Regardless, I still agree with the entire rest of the paragraph.  People make their choices, and live with them.<br/><br/>(As an aside, if you want to duke it out over "gamers" and valuing the people you play with and so forth, please, take it to another thread.  Actually, if you want to duke it out about <i>anything</i> please take it to another thread.

I am saying that this stuff is not hard to Get, but that without the basic respect required to communicate preferences and desires clearly, Temple will never know -- and neither will you -- how they are working with it, where they're moving forward and where they can meet to produce a compromise.<br/><br/>Me, I like to tell people what I want and ask them what they want, and take the time to listen. I like to explore the breadth provided by what you characterize as a creatively monochromatic set of tastes, possessed by people whose greatest flaw seems to be that they're pretty much like you.<br/><br/>The indie/SG culture is so concerned with performance -- with proving that something Awesome is Happening and searching for it -- that oftimes, they miss the quiet satisfaction and more gradual but extremely rewarding process of a group finding the amazing things it can do -- and for that matter, they miss the shitty things happening under the superficial veneer of "Awesome," too.<br/><br/>How many of these threads have there been? How many of them can be boiled down to, "Oh, I wish everyone else just EXPANDED THEIR MINDS!"? Why is it that you odd wo/men out always seem to discover that it's their problem, their limits? I mean, it really is amazing that you are *all*, every single one, lone voices of story-seeking sophistication in a sea of nerds moving in lockstep, none of whom you have ever asked to enumerate their own pleasures and issues, their own range of enjoyable things -- or even lent a mote of the optimism you so easily justify when it comes in the form of rhetoric from some fucking rulebook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106648/#Comment_106648" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T21:54:20+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  9:54PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See Temple, things could be so much worse <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106664/#Comment_106664" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T00:37:25+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 12:37AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm: Shut up and get out of my thread.

Six months and one gaming group later, I realized that some people don't want to talk about it because they don't have the tools (and don't care to acquire them), and some people don't want to talk about it because even they don't know.  The silver lining is that the experience helped me find those people who did want to talk about it buried in a group of people who didn't.<br/><br/>EDIT: I come from a similar viewpoint as Malcolm.  I arrived at the point where I felt talking was the answer because I wanted to be very straightforward, honest, and forthcoming with the people in the group.  There are few things I despise more than feeling manipulated, and I definitely did not want to manipulate my friends and fellow gamers to get what I wanted out of a session.  To me, the difference between manipulation and persuasion lies in the openness of your intent - if you make your intent clear, there are certainly techniques for making your message persuasive and using them is fair game, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>In my case, it wasn't so much a case of story gaming vs. traditional gaming as that I had a payoff that other people didn't share:  I enjoy exploring character psychology in some serious depth.  Even so, I think it was a fairly parallel experience to Temple's in some regards.  To shift what I'm thinking more into the terms relevant to him, consider trying to introduce a group to story gaming.  On the persuasion basis, I'm cool with "Hey, I'm intrigued by these story games - can we schedule an extra session this week to try one out?"  or "I really enjoyed that last story game we played, and I'd like to play more of them.  Would anyone be interested in playing Game X with me?"  I'm not so cool with "Hey, let's try this game (which may replace in my mind the other games you enjoy, and I'm only introducing to sneak up on story gaming while you're not looking.)"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106764/#Comment_106764" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T11:19:07+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 11:19AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>some people don't want to talk about it because they don't have the tools (and don't care to acquire them), and some people don't want to talk about it because even they don't know.

I also agree that people who are enjoying themselves aren't likely to stop and think about why.  In addition to those folks, I came across people who were clearly unhappy but still weren't willing to talk about it in any serious or constructive way.  I suspect that, for these people, getting drunk and sending scathing emails at 5am was somehow more fulfilling than any gaming experience.  Somehow they seemed to feed off of their unhappiness with the game, and instead of motivating them to find their fun, it motivated them to lash out at everyone else.  There are probably a million variations on this theme, but it does come up with some frequency.  The only "solution" I've been able to come up with is not to game with these people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106781/#Comment_106781" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T12:00:00+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 12:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>On the persuasion basis, I'm cool with "Hey, I'm intrigued by these story games - can we schedule an extra session this week to try one out?" or "I really enjoyed that last story game we played, and I'd like to play more of them.

Instead of forcing Burning Wheel down throats as a compromise between D&amp;D and SotC (which is exactly what it is for me; I'm probably "wrong" but let's save that for another thread), try asking the guys like this:<br/><br/>"Hey, who's free on thursday? I've got this weird thing I *love*, and I wanna see if anyone else digs it. Bring a friend who doesn't game much/at all; it's a good new thing for noobs."<br/><br/>You get enthusiastic veterans and fresh blood. Also, I desperately suggest you drink beer once a week with your gaming group. If not a drinker, then see a movie, go bike riding, whatever. Make them <i>real friends</i>, so instead of persuasion, you're asking a favor. That's my biggest, best advice for any frustrated gamer: make <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gaming</span> friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106853/#Comment_106853" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T16:25:55+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  4:25PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>I suspect that, for these people, getting drunk and sending scathing emails at 5am was somehow more fulfilling than any gaming experience.</blockquote>\nHey, for some it's Internet flamewars.
