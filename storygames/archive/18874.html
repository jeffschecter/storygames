What about yours? How do you feel about games that help you do that? What about games with mechanics that help GMs do that? What's your favorite, which one you could never get or hate to use?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422691/#Comment_422691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T09:38:20+00:00" title="October 10, 2013  9:38AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm working on a set of questions to help players create their characters as a group. I've seen a GM friend of mine use open questions on our last campaign, and while it did worked nicely, it caught us a bit by surprise (since it was the first time we tried this approach) and some open questions felt less fair than others. <br/><br/>So, considering the setting I'll use in our next campaign, I went ahead and made a list of six sets of questions, each one with a positive and a negative version. Roll a dice and if you're lucky you get a positive open question like "How was that you became known as the best *choose one of your maxed skills here* in town?"<br/><br/>Each set of questions is meant to be answered by different players in order to relate both their characters and/or NPCs, creating a relationship tree in the process. Following the previous example, the question for the next player would be "Your character knows *previous player character*, because once she/he save your hide using her/his *chosen skill*. How it happened?"<br/><br/>On top of that, each answer is meant to be stated as a fate Aspect, so it can be used mechanically in the game. And the amount of aspects the chracter gets is dependant on their age: The older they are, the more complex their background. It\xb4s better to have all players present to run the process, so I still haven't playtested it. Hope it works ok and doesn't take ages...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422694/#Comment_422694" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T11:02:44+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 11:02AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I draw a blank with games that require a character background in the form of a deliberate literary work. I remember vividly how difficult it was for me to play <i>Amber</i> a decade back, the GM wanted the full traditional backstory treatment and I didn't particularly care; I was expecting the game to show me what's what, but it was just a mirror for my supposed need to show off my specially interesting character. (In hindsight my difficulties were because of how the game was a total black hole in terms of creative agenda: there wasn't any purpose to what we were doing, so no wonder I was bored shitless after the first couple of sessions of nothing of import happening.) I ended up populating my character's backstory with NPCs named after ingredients of a back of chips that was lying near my computer as I composed this unnecessary piece of literature.<br/><br/>The above has nothing to do with not being able to author stories (obvious, perhaps, if you're familiar with my profession), it's just that I find it impractical to think of characters I play in that way. I don't understand the appeal, it's just boring.<br/><br/>The games I'm really fond of are all about discovering your character in play. For example, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>: the character creation process is a bold declaration of subject matter, not a treatment on the topic per se; the point is that you're declaring that your character is this age, class, gender, from this particular culture, and these are things he believes, and you think that exploring these things in play will be interesting. That's positioning your character to address things, all very function-oriented: I make these choices about my character because these are the topics and viewpoints I want here. It would suck if I had to play the game in an immersive manner, trying to figure out what color my character's hair is or what the occupation of his parents was. We'll get to those things when they come up in play, and if they don't, then they don't matter.<br/><br/>Yesterday we were playing D&amp;D, and I generated a new character for the new adventure, as I didn't have any that would've been suitable for it in my stable. I accidentally wrote my own name in the "Name" slot on the character sheet, so now my character's name is "Eero", at least until I find an eraser. I know nothing about him at all - he's probably male and he's a 1st level cleric, but so far he's otherwise a tabula rasa. This does not bother me, as the game of D&amp;D is all about discovered fictional position as the determinant of who or what your character is; Eero the cleric will, assuming he lives (which I doubt - based on the last session he has a distinct death urge), find his own "thing" at some point, and I have no idea what it'll be. He might find a cool magic item, or accomplish some great deed, or be stricken by the evil or nobility of whatever and go on a quest. An earlier character I had in this campaign found his identity when he discovered the beauty and danger of the fantastic wilderness we adventured in, which made him decide that he wanted to be a ranger.<br/><br/>All in all, I suppose my characters don't usually have a story at all when the game begins. They usually have positioning and identity of whatever sort the given game utilizes, but the lonely fun factor of imagining my character's life from the inside is almost non-existent for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422722/#Comment_422722" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T22:13:41+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 10:13PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I get what you mean Eero, I'm a comic writer myself and I have no prob about making additional content for the character if it's mandatory... but that's the word for me: mandatory, something imposed that will often feel like a chore and may or most probably may not matter too much for the current campaign. Even if the GM actively wants to use PC backgrounds to incorporate them into the main plot, there would be players that defet the purpose by creating, as in my friend's case, an ermit forest elf ranger who had no attachments to the outside world at all, wan conveniently an orphan and had nothing to risk and nothing to lose in the main plot. <br/><br/>I've got no much problems about playing to find out and even having the GM and other players work to make the plot reach you, except that as a GM, I often find this inefficient, unstable and time-consuming. PCs get together but they may not develope other bonds between themselves than "you are useful and until you prove the contrary, we'll be on the same boat", and as for bounds with NPCs most don't go further than "I need to kill you to get XP" or "I need to talk to you to get the plot going". Maybe "The GM made you on the fly so let's see how much can I leech out from you"<br/><br/>Of course, that's the worst case. I've also been in the best case scenario, where PCs start the game with 30 hp, no skills and no further description than being the players themselves when they were 15; and then see them learn rules on play and grow up in personality and power until becoming powerful wizards with dozens of custom-made spells, equipment and different mechanics for their magics. And all of it while having fun.<br/><br/>Well I'm trying a middle point for this game I'm working on right now, shooting questions left and right to inspire the players, avoid the blank page syndrome or plot-phobia, while seeing the whole plot grown with each collaboration. I'm all for brainstorming, which is usually the method we use to create and edit all comics in our company. It usually creates a relaxed atmosphere where every single small input is respected, and used as it is or to build something bigger upon it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
