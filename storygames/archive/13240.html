Elric, von Bek, Jerry Cornelius, Jherek Carnelian, Law vs Chaos and the Cosmic Balance you catch my drift I'm sure... And so when I read Daniel's <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/split-decision.html" rel="nofollow">Split Decision</a> rules, with the Red/Blue balance I instantly thought of the balance between Chaos and Law in the Eternal Champion saga; but will it work for me?<br/><br/>Things that I want to reflect the elements of the saga:<br/><br/>* There are the Gods of Chaos (GoC) and the Gods of Law (GoL) vying to control the world.<br/>* There is an Eternal Champion (EC) who is ultimately fighting on behalf of the Cosmic Balance (though is often screwed over by the Gods beyond their control)<br/>* The possibility to introduce trope characters: The Consort, The Companion, The Enemy (enthralled by Chaos or Law and instilled with a burning hatred of the EC)<br/>* The possibility to introduce trope items: The Black Sword, The Runestaff, The Grail<br/>* There are multiple worlds being played for, each with their own EC and struggle but all tying into the fate of the Multiverse<br/><br/><br/>So, my rough ideas so far have led me to adapt Split Decision in the following way:<br/><br/>* The game has three players: the EC, the GoC and the GoL<br/>* Choose an odd number of worlds you are going to be playing through.<br/>* Starting with with the EC and going clockwise, each player takes a turn to select the type of scene they are narrating and their goal. Success in a scene is based upon how high you roll. I'm still pinning down scene types, but they include: Establishing the EC or playing with his allegiances; World Introduction/Travel/Exploration; Introducing/Manipulating/Removing a selected trope character; Starting/Continuing/Completing the EC on a quest for a selected trope item.<br/>* Once a player has selected the Scene Type and stated their desired outcome then they then roll as per the Split Decision mechanics: <br/>If you kept two red dice add two Chaos tokens to the Balance of the World<br/>If you kept two blue dice add two Law tokens to the Balance of the World<br/>If you kept one red and one blue then add a token based upon the higher die (or one of each if the score is tied)<br/>The Balance of the World represents the hold the GoC and GoL have over it in their great game. <br/>* The active player narrates the success/failure (working in how this benefits either Law or Chaos based on the tokens earned). <br/>* However, narration of a failure can be taken "stolen" by other player. To do this the GoC spends a Red token from the Balance, the GoL spends a Blue token from the Balance, or the EC adds a token to the balance of the colour opposite to the active God.<br/>* Once a player has failed three rolls the game ends. Tally up the number of tokens in the Balance of the World. If Chaos or Law dominates by two or more points then they have won it to their cause and narrate it's fate; otherwise the world maintains a state of balance and the EC narrates the world fate.<br/>* Rinse and Repeat for the number of worlds agreed and then tally up the state of the Multiverse at the end.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298160/#Comment_298160" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T04:31:14+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  4:31AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would need a way of quickly setting the stage for whatever scenes players would create. Do you plan to create modules of some kind? Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd know where to start if I were the first player. There are a lot of models you could follow for this purpose, like Universalis, Prime Time Adventures or Mortal Coil.<br/><br/>I'm not as familiar with Moorcock (though you did send me down a long rabbit hole of wikipedia and tvtropes links, thanks! ^_^), so can you explain what the Chaos and Law players would be describing on their turns? Do they have their own avatars through whom they impose their will on this universe?<br/><br/>Also, is there a way for the non-active players to do something besides interrupt the active player? Seems like it would be tough to keep up their interest, but maybe that's just me. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298371/#Comment_298371" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T14:36:17+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  2:36PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I am thinking is that each player's turn would be called a "Chapter". They would each have their own "chapter menu" which they would select from at the start of their turn and then roll for. Some options would be shared, some would be unique, and some would only be able to be used based on prior outcomes. <br/><br/>If the player passes their roll then this means two things: 1) They get full narrative control over the events of the Chapter,  including the Eternal Champion and any other NPC's (representing how their fate is not always their own) and in-keeping with the chapter ultimately tipping the balance towards Law or Chaos; and 2) the effects the "Chapter" take effect (such as providing modifiers on future rolls of a particular type, introducing a trope item/NPC, changing the alignment of the Eternal Champion, causing an effect if the game ends that round, opening up new Chapter options, modifying the balance between Law/Chaos etc).<br/><br/>If a player fails a roll then they can narrate how the action fails with no other ill effect UNLESS it is taken over by another player, then the failure has a listed game effect and the player who steals the scene gets narration.<br/><br/>In any case, whoever is narrating must keep the narrative constant (eg: no contradictions, storyflow is maintained, etc), and every chapter has to be of relevance to the Eternal Champion (though need not contain them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298379/#Comment_298379" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T16:32:43+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  4:32PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Also, is there a way for the non-active players to do something besides interrupt the active player?

Am I being too hopeful with this? <br/><br/>As an aside, this approach is all due to Joe Prince's Contenders, Hell 4 Leather and My god's Bigger Than Your God (his game chef entry this year). I've played all three recently and had a lot of fun with all of them. My original idea was to have more players and have them play all the different tropes, but I think Chaosium and Mongoose have that covered in their own way. I don't just want to capture he setting of The Million Spheres, I have to get the feel of Moorcock's books into a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298851/#Comment_298851" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-30T17:45:00+00:00" title="October 30, 2010  5:45PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2010 3:00AM by Tanya Fyans.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Introduction</b><br/>The players should agree on a general genre/style for the world (fantasy, steampunk, contemporary, alternate reality/history, etc). The player representing the will of the Eternal Champion introduces the character of the champion and their place in the world while the players representing the Forces of Chaos &amp; Law introduce their manifestations (as opposing gods, political ideologies, forms of governance, cultures, etc). This is a fluid process; Players should be open to suggestion from each other and perhaps work to sketch out a map and note some key features of the world. These can be added to as the story progresses. <br/><br/><br/><b>Chapters</b><br/>Starting with the EC each player should take it in turn to:<br/>1) Name the Chapter and Select either a Goal (either one not yet in play or one placed in play by another player)<br/>2) Make a Split Decision roll - Red tokens represent Chaos, Blue tokens represent Law - all tokens are added to the Balance<br/>3) If the roll you made is 10 and the card is not yet in play you may place it in front of you and gain the conditions of Success; If the card was already in play then you <br/>5) Narrate the Chapter based upon any outcomes generated (the tokens going into the Balance and the roll itself). Narration of the story must follow on from the past events and should focus on the some aspect of the struggle of The Eternal Champion (even if they are not in the chapter). You are encouraged to work with the other players to create the narrative and may use existing characters and elements as you wish.<br/><br/><br/><b>Epilogue </b><br/>Once a player has failed three (or should this be 5?) rolls you should complete the narration of the scene and then move to the Epilogue. Calculate the difference between the number of Law tokens and Chaos tokens in the balance. If the scores are the same then the Eternal Champion gains a perfect victory. If one side only has 1-2 tokens more in the Balance then the Eternal Champion has a partial win. If one Power has 3-4 tokens more in their side of the Balance then they have a partial win, while if they have 5 or more tokens in their favour then they have a total victory. The players should work together to narrate the outcome for the Eternal Champion and the world itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298922/#Comment_298922" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T07:49:58+00:00" title="November  1, 2010  7:49AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2010 9:53AM by Tanya Fyans.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Cosmic Struggle</span></i><br/><b>Success</b> Add one token to the Balance;
