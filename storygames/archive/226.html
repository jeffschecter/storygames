                    Ben Lehman asked about my actual play, and since I'm just getting something started, I yammer...<br/><br/>(EDIT: Fixed my misspelling of Ben's surname. Sorry, Ben!)<br/><br/><a href="http://drop253.drizzle.com/nwod/" rel="nofollow">This little collection of pages</a> is what I gave players for chargen, along with the following discussion...<br/><br/>My intent is to take the characters from being mortal outsiders to (often unwilling or at least unintended) Kindred insiders, over the course of a quarter-century. This is a chronicle about the cascading consequences of unexpected changes, when sensible plans suddenly go awry and you must now improvise...and powerful forces are peering down your neck.<br/><br/>For purposes of this chronicle, the World of Darkness Seattle as of 1980 is a very old-school place: Ventrue and Invictus. (For those of you unfamiliar with current Vampire, the Ventrue are the archetypal "blue-blood" aristocrats and power-mongers of the vampire world, and the Invictus covenant is dedicated to the maintenance of vampiric safety and power over the world, contrasting with the sundry idealists and seekers of apotheosis.) Within the urban boundaries, pretty much everything of value has been parceled out as fiefs; mishaps in the early 20th century led to a policy of "we have no business with what mortals haven't yet developed to a level fit for our use." In practice, this means everyone's got deals and counter-deals going on beneath the table, and in particular, a lot of elders stash havens and goodies in areas not considered part of the domain.<br/><br/>The PCs will mostly be drawn in as pawns useful for the protection of those assets. Then, of course, the city grows, and what was outside the domain is now in it, and <i>then</i> what do the PCs do?<br/><br/>Oh, and of course the very tight power structure is set up in the expectation and hope that it will explode, sometime between 1980 and now. I have some thoughts about how it might happen, but I'm really hoping my players' characters will decide that it needs doing and take the lead in making it happen. <br/><br/>I'm also experimenting with running this a little differently than usual. My intent is to take a good long while at this game, and I'm starting off with the players' characters as mortal men and women, and intend to run the equivalent of multiple short stories about them as alive. Heck, some many not become vampires, or even ghouls, for all I know - vampires do deal with mortals, and being the mortal fixer can be fun, too. In any event, characters will begin play in solo sessions, or with no more than 2-3 characters, and will get together only when it makes sense. <br/><br/>Because of geographic distance and my health problems, this will be run online, using e-mail and real-time chat of some kind. (I'm planning to try out Screen Monkey, having had best reports of it from friends who've experimented with such things.) I expect that, as usual for me, there won't be a lot of dice-rolling. While I'm not a thoroughly immersive player, nor are many of the folks in my group, we do share the immersive fondness for well-benchmarked characters and reduced randomness except at times when characters must pit their conscious will against challenges to that sense of self and self-control. That is, I'm more likely to call for a Frenzy check than a Spot check. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks in part to things said in threads here, I'm in the process of statting up various of the groups of power and authority the characters will be dealing with as pseudo-characters, for help in benchmarking interactions with them. I haven't done this before except with testing the Gamma World community rules, so I'm really looking forward to seeing how it goes.<br/><br/>And, um, that's what occurs to me right now, apart from character concepts delivered so far. That'll be a separate post. I do a lot of sleeping during the day, but I'd be happy to take questions.                </div>

<p>Heh.  I like the idea (perhaps only projected from my own mind onto what you wrote) that the Vampire themes of "do you degenerate into a monster" can play out less in the tawdry "Do you drink human blood?" metaphor, and more in the "What do you do when <em>you</em> are the one in power, and the situation's totally screwed beyond fixing, but everyone is looking at you to tell them what to do next?"</p>
<p>If it were me, my main goals would be (a) the players hate and loathe the current batch of Elders, seeing them as alternately weak and monstrous, but agreeing that they would never, <strong>never</strong> do the kind of things that the Elders are doing, were the PCs in charge, (b) put them in charge and (c) see whether they can avoid doing all the same sorts of weak and monstrous things themselves.</p>
<p>How do you plan to go about creating the NPC batch of Elders, and their power relationships?  What sort of prep-work goes into that?  Will there be player involvement?</p>

                            I'm doing a mix of things for the elders.<br/><br/>First, I'm using a lot of the stock NPCs out of the covenant books, because they seem to suit what I want to do, and nicking a few from WoD: New Orleans. A few characters, most particularly the semi-sane Russian Ventrue prince (for whom Seattle is just an exile until he can return home and lead the glorious revolution), are nicked from a LARP I ran some years ago set in 1945 San Franciso. I liked the characters then and still do. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Second, I'm just poking around at combos of disciplines, virtues, and vices that I think I can play well and want to try out.<br/><br/>Players aren't having much input at this initial stage of vampire NPC creation, but will as their characters get drawn in. I'm deliberately leaving a lot of openings for later use, and in the past I've sometimes gone ahead and tossed out my prep in favor of better ideas from my players. (I love my players. It's a great group and I've missed playing with them.)<br/><br/>For me it's not a lot of work. Some gets written down in full dot detail. Some is done in varying degrees of partialness. If I get anything scannable, I'll put it up for folks to look at.<br/><br/>Your three-part goal is very much in line with what I'm doing. The engine of the chronicle is "Here's some unwanted power, what do you do with it? Think fast." Also, one of my standing delights with Vampire is tracing one's inevitable obsolesence. After all, over the course of a year, a vampire gets no more than 12 hours a day...and that's not enough to keep up with a bustling mortal world, even when you throw out much of the demands of mortal lives. Vampires must always watch the world slip away from them, and deal with new things increasingly by analogy and abstraction and through intermediaries. My players know I dig that and seemt o be setting up characters who'll face the challenge in interesting ways.                        </div>

                            The first fully-statted PC is in my hands now. Hella Eckart is a feminist graduate student in geology at the University of Washington, played by British reviewer Matthew Pook. Mount St. Helens erupted in May of 1980, and play begins a few months later, to provide context fo a bit that follows. These are the questions that I asked Matthew for a little supporting color:<br/><br/>=-=-=-=-=<br/><br/>Is Hella native to the Seattle area?<br/><br/>If not, how long as she been there?<br/><br/>(University of Washington - U Dub, in local lingo - does draw a worldwide audience, so any answer is viable here.)<br/><br/>There's a sometimes nasty-tempered rift in the local Buddhist community between those who favor urban retreats (this is where the need is, and you must be there) and those who favor rural ones (peace is the way to strength). Which side does Hella favor? And does she inclined toward any martial arts studies, or not?<br/><br/>She necessarily spent a lot of the last year and change on Mt. St. Helens field duty. Was she interested in vulcanology before that? Is she now? How does she feel about the sudden glamorous standing of the department's volcano guys?<br/><br/>In her studies, she deals with cutting-edge VAX timesharing computers. Does she do anything other than geology work with them, or does she not care?<br/><br/>It's a warm, sunny day and she's unexpectedly got a day off. What does she do on the spur of the moment? Same question for a wet, cold, rainy day.<br/><br/>=-=-=-=-=<br/><br/>We'll have one more round, based on what he tells me here, and then I'll be set to get underway. When I run online, I tend to get pretty immersive and low-mechanics except when I'm playtesting, and this isn't a playtest. (Remind me another time to write up about the joys of having no professional obligations to a game line, after years of having them.) I plan to do some slice-of-life scenes so that Matthew and I build up a repertoire of NPCs and locales for later use. And since she's ready first, she will do a bit of duty as the one others' paths cross.                        </div>

                            Oh, I should note that right now I've defined nobody in Hella's department. I will cast a few of my favorite character actors in supporting roles and wing the rest. I grew up dabbling in Caltech social life, since Dad worked for Jet Propulsion Labs and was a Caltech alumnus, and will just loot recollections.                        </div>
