It's easier to pull with 2-3 players. It gets tricky for 6+. Just count speech time and the main problem will become obvious.<br/>Different projects ? If two groups of PCs are co-present, it's easier to subsume each character individuality into a collective goal. <br/>Information complexity ? If you are playing intrigue or combat without room for what they misname "metagaming",  any game where actively hidden information is key, that won't work. You can't tickle yourself.<br/>But. Taking turns so that half a 4-5 player team is always playing a simple character in addition to their main, sometimes swapping main for side character (giving depth to the side C and putting the main in "simple mode"). We do it and it's not uncommon I think. When the story leads, the characters play themselves. This style is very plot driven (see Characters as devices).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471272/#Comment_471272" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T03:36:40+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  3:36AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IME, in practice what happens is you have an additional character who gets passed around as needed.

They all started with just a physical appearance and a line or two of what others first impressions were of them upon seeing them in the drill hall. We went around the table picking in rounds until each player had 6 characters. We then played them and started adding background details from a pool of traits (this included what they were really like behind their demeanour, skills, dark secrets, relationships with other cadets/judges etc). These were introduced in as the focus of the session so we got to know them as the story unfolded. However, the game also had a Big Brother type aspect where characters died off (training accidents, an APC crash, surviving the radioactive zombie hoard in the wilderness outside MegaCityOne), and we eventually parsed down to one character each. <br/><br/>Thinking on it I think I coukd turn that idea into the basis for a system to play out stories in the vein of The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones TV shows, where there is an ensemble cast that grow in character but that have shock deaths taking place each episode. You could keep the dead characters for flashback scenes... <br/><br/>*puts on designer hat and coat and heads out the door muttering something about being back soon*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471275/#Comment_471275" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T12:25:53+00:00" title="March 30, 2018 12:25PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tanya,<br/><br/>That reminds me a bit of Funnel World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471277/#Comment_471277" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T14:36:44+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  2:36PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds great, and I've often wanted to do something like that.<br/><br/>How did you generate the "pool of traits"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471279/#Comment_471279" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-30T17:36:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2018  5:36PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2018 5:36PM by Jeph.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of times I've run an ensemble cast game I call <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/179GqrH_Cl9OSnG8D8ttMXGZqJ_GgADTVWEdvtAKWfyw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Exploits of the Intrepid Crew of the Fairweather Jay on the Shrouded Sky-Isle of Doom</a>. It starts with drafting a crew for the titular Jay: you randomly generate 32 possible crewmen by shuffling together lists of given and family names, backgrounds, traits, shipboard roles, and special possessions, and then the players pick 12-20. The rest were rejected on the docks or died in the crash.<br/><br/>Players then have collective control over the crew. They can run them by committee, or all play a few crewmen, or each choose one to focus on for a session or a scene or whatever.<br/><br/>My group, in practice, ended up claiming 1-2 characters each for the duration of each session.

I think <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph%27s">@Jeph's</a> original post influenced my decisions. The expectations about play changes radically if the players play and manage the whole group (fe a company) and not just particular characters. Thinking about the PCs as hand puppets and using the idea of having two hands to play enables traditional players to play the same 1-2 PCs all the time but it also encourages everyone to change PCs a lot if they want.<br/><br/>Another approach could be the 'HR' method when you definitely only have one true PC as your point of immersion but the gameplay is centered around managing your followers, retainers, mercenaries which are not fully PCs (no full control) yet nor really NPCs neither (fe. you roll for them). This feels very close to having multiple PCs but is psychologically easier to grasp I think. BitD could do this without much tweaking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471305/#Comment_471305" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-31T13:34:55+00:00" title="March 31, 2018  1:34PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I encourage a 'pool' of characters for games such as Call of Cthulhu where long-term PC absences are expected. I like to have the characters part of the same social grouping so that one PC suddenly knowing about the experiences of another isn't too meta. Players can also take whichever PC suits the scenario brief best, although that isn't always possible. <br/><br/>As for playing multiple characters, we used to do it all the time in AD&amp;D back in the early days. It was a combination of small player base and the urge to test out all the class/race combinations, and worked well enough for games where little storytelling or roleplaying occurred. <br/><br/>On a similar vein to <i>hmnacb</i>'s point, in Trail of Cthulhu I played my main character but also the Sources of Stability (except where the GM had PLANS). There is also the Follower feat in Pathfinder which allows for a similar situation. Taking multiple characters along actually into the scenario proper is problematic for meta-reasons, but is certainly not insurmountable if the players involved are sensible and get behind the whole 'a group of individual people' idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
