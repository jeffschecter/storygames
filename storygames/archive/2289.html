                    ...and I don't mean, "Jeremie was supposed to bring Hoegaarden but instead brought Blue Moon to gaming night".I'm talking about those juicy gaming betrayals.<br/><br/>Any stories about the best, or worst?<br/>Was it a one-shot, mini-campaign or long term game?<br/>Were all the players clueless to it coming down, or did they see it coming?<br/>Was the betrayal satisfying to all involved?<br/><br/>For me, I'm always on the fence in terms of in-game betrayals. They usually fall into two categories from what I've seen, and I'm looking for ones that break the mold:<br/>1) A quick game (one shot or mini-campaign) where all the players pretty much know that there's gonna be some fat betrayal going down, and even who is doing it.<br/>2) A long term game where a betrayal tends to derail and fuck up the game, leaving the long-term players a bitter taste.<br/><br/>I think one of the more satisfying betrayals was in a long term (approx 6+ month) Unknown Armies game that I was running. One of my players in my weekly game always takes the "weird guy"; the one with the most screwed up backstory, the most bizarre or powerful abilities, etc. In this game, he was "The Count", a shaman who lied to everyone all the time, and was basically a fake-voodoo huckster with a pimpin' psychic shop. To make a long story short, he was cutting on the other characters here and there: Going behind their backs, not sharing evidence, keeping secrets, pursuing hidden agendas. Meanwhile the other characters are doing the "party thing": Staying together, sharing info, bitching about the huckster.<br/><br/>In the last session of that campaign, we had a huge betrayal. Basically throughout the game they were entering and leaving this NPC-created labrynthine universe that was basically the product of a powerful NPC with an artifact who wanted to become a god. The characters determined that there was no way to kill him, but so that our world wasn't consumed, they had to basically shut the universe off, completely disconnect it from ours (there were some anchors in our world that kept it tied to our universe, basically in the form of doorways where people could pass back and forth between the two worlds). <br/><br/>What everyone suspected for that last session that The Count was going to find a way to take control of this new Universe, and become its new ruler, and basically fight against the other PCs in a final standoff.  <br/><br/>What ended up happening was that The Count found a way to seperate the proto-crazy-universe from our own, and worked with the PCs to do so. Unfortunately, one of the other players, knowing full well what was happening, made the call to destroy the last anchor to that universe. He and another PC were left on Earth, and The Count and the other two PCs were stranded in crazy-universe Forever. As GM I made the call to roll with it, basically allowing things to happen as that player intended: The Earth was saved, and his buddies were gone forever.<br/><br/>It might be seen more of a Hard Choice than a Betrayal, but it was cool nonetheless.  The PC that made that call was a pretty trusted member of the group, and the player pretty much decided to make that call at the last minute.  So there wasn't any buildup over several sessions or anything. It was a pretty harsh move, but honestly was pretty fitting for the game. There wasn't any bad blood at the player level either, aside from a few "what the fuck???"s and some good-natured ribbing about backstabbing in a few future sessions.<br/><br/>Others?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Long term D&amp;D game that had been going for 3 or 4 years (pretty much since 3rd ed. hit the UK), continuing online after our group had to split up due to numerous of us finishing uni.  After the split we got some new players joining the campaign as older ones dropped out.  One of the new players was the DMs brother playing a bard/ranger called Waldair, an old friend and adventuring buddy of the head of my templar order whose name, sadly, escapes me now.  I was playing a half-elf Ranger/Templar named Owyn who was trying to find his father.  Now, Owyn was my first ever D&amp;D character and I invested a lot of time and effort into him and followed his journey like the emotional rollercoaster it was.  Some of my best sessions have come playing Owyn and, although the campaign wound down a year or so ago now, I still remember him fondly and wish we cold get together for one, final, face-to-face session.<br/><br/>Anyway, a big driver for the campaign was Owyn's quest to find his father (the previous head of the Order of Leaf and Thorn) who, it turned out, had vanished in an expedition to an ancient, ruined city many years ago.  Various adventures and a particularly useful talk with a God had revealed that his father was still alive but a prisoner (along with numerous others) in the city, held captive by a powerful demon of the Void, the campaigns big bad.  This Void Demon was a massively powerful leuitenant of the Void and releasing the prisoners would mean releasing the demon as well (it was trapped in the city.)  So, after a lot of effort, adventure, incompetance, heroism and general craziness we got to the city and descended into the depths.  We managed entry using a magical key that had to be powered by a pure and honest emotion.  It was Owyn's love for his father and for Ahrimel, the groups unofficial leader and semi-divine cleric (did I mention that, as the game progressed, it turned out that Owyn was gay?  I had no clue when I made the character ^_^), that opened the gate and got everyone in.<br/><br/>The prisoners were freed, Owyn was reunited with his father and then the Demon appeared.  A huge fight ensued where Waldair volunteered to lead out the prisoners as he wasn't so hot in a fight anyway.  Owyn was going to wade into the combat but fate intervened.  I rolled low on initiative and everyone got to go before me so, by my turn, the demon was quite literally surrounded by summoned creatures from our conjourer and druid.  Anyway, I dithered for a round before deciding that owyn would go and aid Waldair in getting his father and the other prisoners out (I was pretty confident that the Solar summoned by Ahrimel along with the rest of the zoo would take down the demon without too many problem, I was right) so he turned and sprinted up the stairway...<br/><br/>...just in time to witness Waldair throwing a nuke (fully loaded necklace of fireballs) into a small room where he'd herded the prisoners, including Owyn's father.  Massive boom, chargrilled innocents, rage and grief!  Obviously a big fight between Waldair and Owyn ensued and the dice wanted it to be emotional and drawn out, numerous fumbles were rolled, weapons dropped as death blows missed in the narrow corridor.  Eventually Owyn cut his friend down before staggering into the room where the prisoners had burned and laying his fathers old sword (which he had been carrying for the past few years) at his father feet.<br/><br/>It was immense, epic and one of the greatest roleplaying sessions that I've ever been involved in.  I had no clue it was going to happen, although the DM and other players were in on it, and that made it all the better for me.  The betrayal was outstandingly done and I loved it, there was no bitterness at all and Waldair's player fully accepted the fact that he would be rolling up a new character.  If I'd lost the fight I'd have rolled up a new character too.  I discovered the motivations after the fact and it made a certain, twisted sense.  It also lead to me fundamentally altering Owyn's personality.  He admitted his feelings for Ahrimel (and was gently rebuffed) and spiralled down into a darker and darker place, finally ending with almost a repeat of Waldair's crime.  He killed, in cold blood, a room full of councillors of his own Church just becasue they were dithering and making excuses to avoid aiding in the forthcoming battle against the Void, handing control of the Church to an unsuspecting Ahrimel in the process.  Sadly the campaign hasn't moved on since then as we want to get together IRL to finish it off and have the final battle against the Void and we haven't had a chance yet (mostly my fault if I'm being honest.)                        </div>

There was no chance of me being mad IRL, you should know that ^_^ .  I like screwing over my characters far too much to be mad when someone else does it for me!  Besides, it was so well executed and such a complete shock that I couldn't fail to be emotionally moved by the whole thing and it really fired me up to take Owyn to new places.<br/><br/>A stand-out session of my RP career and one that I'm very glad caught me so totally unawares.                        </div>

                            KULT one-shot, with my best friends who'd been playing together for, oh, five years several times a week.<br/><br/>We've got three players: Marc, Daniel, and Florian.  I'm the GM, as usual.  We decide to have a one-shot non-occult game using the KULT rules, just for fun.  The protagonists are IRA activists (i.e., terrorists) who take over a building, take hostages, and fight off the SAS, the strong arm of the oppressive and evil British Empire.  This is not a fantasy version of our world, but more of an enthusiastic exploration of potentially real events.  Set to happy-tuned Eire Og songs like this one:<br/><br/>Go on home, British soldiers, go on home<br/>Have you got no fucking homes of your own?<br/>Go fuck the Union Jack,<br/>We want our country back<br/>Go on home, British soldiers, go on home<br/><br/>Because strangely, German lefties are highly supportive of select Nationalist movements (such as Ireland's and Palestine's).<br/><br/>The game went reasonably well.  Everyone had fun being a fanatic sociopath, facing the challenge of keeping the SAS out without moral restrictions vis a vis the hostages, and so on.  Until Florian's character put a gun to Daniel's character's head, revealing that he was an undercover agent.  That knowledge was not shared with Daniel and Marc before the game.<br/><br/>Now, Marc was only somewhat annoyed, but Daniel was pissed.  I am talking about a flushed face, raised heart beat, full on defensive mode kind of pissed.  He was even more upset that Florian thought the revelation was really funny.  So he refused to give up in character, forcing Florian to shoot, then used the system to take away Florian's victory (using fate points to turn a lethal wound to a mere scratch).  I stopped the game then.<br/><br/>The moral of the story was: if you're going to have betrayal in the game, make sure the players are alright with the potential of that happening, and are not in the middle of wish fulfillment mode that's brought crashing down along with the social contract when someone springs a nasty surprise on them.                        </div>

                            Last week my Tuesday night D&amp;D got it's first true betrayal.<br/>Avalon had been planning to "step it up" and contest the cleric, Dominus, who had been acting as leader.  While most of the party supports Avalon, she decided that "step it up" was "backstab the cleric."  So,  the sugar and spice half-elf jams a sword through the sternum of a man that had fought beside her for months.  Because he had only been taken to -8hp and bleeding (for the non-D&amp;D audience: incapacitated with 12 seconds to live with virtually zero chance of recovery), she delivers the coup-de-grace by stabbing him through the throat.<br/><br/>Fallout hasn't hit yet, but I'm pretty sure it'll be juicy.                        </div>

<br/>
Which is why when we fired up a Fading Suns game we agreed right on from the start that to avoid bad feelings there were to be no secrets in game. No notes passing, no cover your ears you are not to hear this, everything out in the open so that we could riff of each other.<br/>
<br/>
We created our characters as an ad-hock team that finds a BIG SECRET, but has to keep this quiet or the main BAD BOSS will steal the secret for himself. If there was one thing we all could agree on was that the BIG SECRET was not fall into his hands.<br/>
<br/>
My character, a muster (slaver) got off to a rolling start, using nerve gas and being the asshole you love to hate. It was unbelivably cool. I loved playing him, and the other players got their kicks trying to keep up with my schemes to sell THE BIG SECRET while they wanted it for different reasons. I was barreling head first towards a showdown with Christers character (ex-battle brother, think paladin) and the engineer played by Ole (the techie we all needed to get the BIG SECRET) aswell as nearly every faction on the starbase we were on. It was amazing.<br/>
The suddenly, Trond, playing the quiet noble in exile, goes up to the BAD BOSS and totally sells us out. And we all had front row seats. All my plans crumbled and turned to dust, and I loved every second of it. And everyone knew life as our characters knew it just turned very very dangerous.<br/>
Trond, after the game, Trond said he knew his character was going to be betrayed sooner or later so he figured he'd jump the gun.<br/>
<br/>
The game died after I had a crap day at work combined with a pathetic evening with a 1400 dollar phone that didn't work and left right before the dice began hitting the table. It gave the gamenight a bad spin for the rest, and killed the game for the GM. Which sucked and I stil feel bad about.<br/>
<br/>
But that sweet moment of betrayal still smells sweet. So thanks Andy for a tread where I finally can share it.                        </div>

                            I've always wanted to play the evil necromancer who's only with the party because they're killing his enemies.

                            I did a fake betrayal that brought the house down in Star Wars d20. I played an idealistic policy wonk Senator in the days of the rise of the Empire. When Palpatine made his move, he really didn't want my guy around since my guy was smarter and better at being an effective legislator than any of his cronies (thank you WOTC for publishing his stats!) A friend was playing a hawt Jedi girl with a purple lightsaber and a Mysterious Destiny, Nia Mae-Shin. who Palpatine and his dark side cronies were constantly trying to pull onto the side of evil.<br><br>So Palpatine had his goons drag my guy off the Senate floor (my guy had arranged for the time and place of his arrest, did I mention he was smarter and better?) and arrest his hot gun-toting sister, too. In the villain-is-gloating secret room in the Senate building, Anakin Skywalker and Palpatine were there and Palpatine was going on and on. <br><br>"Let's cut to the chase." I interrupted. It helps that I have more real-life charisma than the GM. "You don't want <b>this.</b> (And here I point to Anakin.) Why settle for second best? You want the real deal. You want Nia Mae-Shin, and I can give her to you."<br><br>The room erupted, everyone was freaking out, pointing, yelling, laughing, the GM was baffled. It was a fine moment. The denouement was pretty average, Palpatine decided that he couldn't possibly trust my guy, remember, he knows my guy is smarter and better than him and has spent the last few years cheerfully stabbing everything he tries to do in the face. (If it were stabs in the back, he could understand them.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Eric, Lisa, Ulysses and I just finished a few month campaign of TSOY which ended in Ulysses betraying (and murdering) us all. It was a triumphant ending to a political campaign and the ending felt right. I was grinning ear to ear and even suggested how he should off Lisa's character. We had cross-keys set up for all of this. We knew for a while that it was coming, because the keys told us so.<br><br>I was trying to free a slave race, Lisa was going to take the throne, and Ulysses was going to steal the throne and power.                        </br></br></div>

                            The only time I've LARPed, it was in high school and it was because a friend who had written a one-shot Vampire scenario decided that he needed me to play the Prince.  I shrugged and agreed, LARPing back then not having the stigma I attach to it now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The basic premise was as follows: a vampire had stolen my scepter, the official symbol of my office, because he came into my offices and found the dead body of his close friend whom I had secretly killed (for some unclear reason).  I needed to get it back to maintain enough power to keep away the large faction that wanted to overthrow me, but even more so they wanted my second-in-command dead.<br><br/>There was various scheming and colluding with my second, trying to pacify those who demanded justice for the dead vampire.  Then the scepter thief returned because he wasn't sure who had killed his friend and he still wanted to support me.  I told him he would have his justice.  I called a blood hunt against my second-in-command and after the mob had worn her down, I dealt the killing blow, announcing that the dead man's murder had been avenged, thus appeasing the calls for justice as well as the faction who didn't like her.<br/><br/>The scepter thief's player, who OOC knew very well what was going on, got this great wide-eyed look on his face and OOCly said, "Oh you <b><i>bastard!</i></b>" through a big grin.                        </br></div>

                            Mo, Gary, Charles and I were playing a TSOY game set in Ammeni. Mo is playing the Zaru mistress of Babar Sher, the badest ass NPC in the game (and the only NPC that is more powerful than the PCs). Gary is playing a Zaru spymaster who has been working for years to bring down Babar Sher. <br/><br/>So Mo's character is in trouble with one of the lesser house members, and she uses one of her secrets to have a man come save her. (Secret of the Damsel in Distress, spend Instinct to get a man to come to your rescue -- I don't immediately recall all the finer details.) We talk for a second around the table and decide that Gary's character comes to the rescue, driving off the threat and leaving himself partly exposed. Mo's character figures out who he is, and is fascinated by him. <br/><br/>Then Babar Sher walks in with his personal guard, and sees his mistress with another man. He asks her who he is, and what he is doing here. She looks at Gary's character, who just saved her life, then looks Babar in the face and says, "He's the master of the Zaru spies, he's been trying to assassinate you for years. I staged a fight with one of your cousins to draw him out." <br/><br/>Gary's jaw hits the floor and Charles and I start laughing so hard we can barely sit up. Mo's response is to shrug and say, "I told you that she's a HORRIBLE person, didn't I?" <br/><br/>This was pretty clearly one of the situations where we'd seen this type of thing coming though, because of the keys and characters and the fact that we're playing in Ammeni. It isn't a proper Ammeni game until someone gets betrayed.                        </div>

                            First Amber game I GM'd, one of the players (highest psyche and endurance, with shapeshifting) staged his own much-despised character's death in something like the first third of the campaign.  Five or six sessions into a 20-session game.<br/><br/>He makes up a new character (this is important) built almost entirely with Stats -- only power he had was Broken Pattern and major levels of control over the Shadow it was in.   This guy is big strapping Scotmans where the first guy was weak and anemic -- bluff and honest and open where the other guy was conniving and vicious and petty -- and generally liked where the other guy wasn't.<br/><br/>Halfway through the second-to-last session, with the Universe all going to shambles, there's a fight and a big explosion in that second character's lab/magical tinkering room, and he's blown out the wall of the tower and falls six stories to the courtyard below -- one of the other PCs pushes through the crowd to find the groaning form of the FIRST character, shocked back out of the 'full psychic-imprint shapeshift' that he'd meant to lock himself into for the next couple years in order to build trust and alliances before reverting to his original self.<br/><br/>She (the player) calmly excused herself, walked outside the house, and let out such a blood-curdling scream that I thought someone was going to call the cops.  The two players ended up getting married, later, actually. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
