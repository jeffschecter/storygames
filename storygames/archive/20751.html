Are we making new mechanics because we are having trouble describing a fictional scenarios? I mean is the problem we feel we are solving more about description than mechanics? I beginning to think sometimes we just don't know what something would look like and have no idea how to describe the fiction in game and that's why we turn to making new mechanics.<br/><br/>I know that some rules definitely help frame the description and I this is good. But in some cases I feel like we are just running into fiction we don't know how to describe so we tackle it with rules. I was just thinking today about this because i saw a PbtA game that had a "high speed chase" move. And I was thinking, do you need a move? Couldn't you just describe it? But Ive never written a high speed chase before, would it be any good? <br/><br/>How do you find that balance? Is there something we should be doing to teach people to describe fiction rather than making mechanics?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455718/#Comment_455718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-22T17:32:47+00:00" title="August 22, 2016  5:32PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is your question about why we need mechanics for a high-speed chase (for instance) at all, or whether we need a <i>specific</i> mechanic for it, as opposed to using something more general such as <b>act under fire</b>?<br/><br/>I think the answer to the first question is that even if you break a high-speed chase down into minutiae, the outcome isn't obvious. Factors involved include driving skill, reaction time, and plain chance, so IMO it's easier and more practical to take a more abstract, mechanics-driven approch to task or conflict resolution. You <i>could</i> just describe it, but personally I would feel uncomfortable just deciding on the outcome of a high-stress situation involving a conflict of interest (although PbtA GMs might have to do this anyway for NPC conflicts, such as when a PC delegates responsiblity).<br/><br/>But yeah, I think the reason for making specific moves is to provide clearer stakes and outcomes for fictional scenarios that are likely to come up often. You can have a catch-all <b>do something</b> move, much like WoDu does, but questions of stakes and outcomes then become on-the-fly rulings which may eventually be implicitly or explicitly codified into specific moves anyway. Which can be totally fine, but may or may not be what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455724/#Comment_455724" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-22T18:12:29+00:00" title="August 22, 2016  6:12PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2016 6:19PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I largely agree with jangler, in that I think the <i>primary</i> intent of mechanics is <i>not</i> usually to assist or replace description.  That said, I do think many mechanics-makers (including many AW-hackers) use "cool things characters in this setting can do" as a starting point, and depending on what sorts of resolution interest them, the line from "roll this Move" to "get this outcome" may cover a lot of the descriptive bases in itself.  <br/><br/>PbtA is particularly ripe for this, as its outcomes most frequently concern fictional position rather than pure mechanics.  I mean, I guess if every time you roll you wind up taking or dealing Harm, or advancing a countdown clock, or taking or losing +1/-1 forward/ongoing, then I suppose the mechanics would be playing their part even without much fiction... but that's not actually the case in the PbtA games I know.  Instead, things like "you take definite hold of it" can be the whole deal.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't feel like "I tried to seize it by force and I succeeded in taking definite hold of it" really covers the most important bases in terms of description for description's sake.  "I seized it" is the bare minimum to know what happened; the situation which allowed you to try, and the specific manner in which you tried, and what it looked like when you succeeded?  That's still all up to the players.<br/><br/>At the same time, I think the more zoomed-in our "roll for this" mechanics get, the more we add or inspire detail for larger events.  "Make one roll for a high speed chase" adds nothing, in my eyes; either we can describe it well or we can't, and the roll just gives us the facts we can riff off or fail to.  "Make three rolls for the different key stages of a high sped chase," on the other hand, opens up moments for thought and surprise and description that might not have occurred to us otherwise.<br/><br/>I guess there are some parallels between (a) breaking a fictional event into several rolls and (b) breaking the flow of narration up with any rolls at all, but to me, if we're gonna get from one neighborhood to another via a high-speed chase, and we think that's fun and interesting, then we're gonna try our hand at describing it, rules or no.  So, on the description front, I value zoomed-in rules more than any old rules.  It's probably relative, though -- maybe there are groups out there who would bother manipulation and aggression on the way to seizing by force, and so AW is calling out incremental steps in the process for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455725/#Comment_455725" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-22T18:22:52+00:00" title="August 22, 2016  6:22PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2016 6:23PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed. I'd also add that injecting mechanics into fictional moments is usually less about creating descriptive detail (that's something the players can do, or not, as they like, in any case) and more about creating *decision points*.<br/><br/>Resolving a chase in one roll generally means that there are few choices to be made (or that they are all made at once). Resolve the chase in 5 rolls, and there may be more opportunities for the player and/or the character to make certain decisions. Do you care about trashing your car? Causing collateral damage? Pick a dangerous route over a safe one? A tricky maneuver, or a desperate gamble?<br/><br/>For example, consider D&amp;D combat (in OSR/early/Basic D&amp;D). All that's at stake is: do the heroes kill the monsters, or vice-versa?<br/><br/>However, including multiple rolls and ablative hit points means that the players can constantly evaluate their position in a fight and decide whether to keep fighting or withdraw after each round. This creates a very important aspect for the game: some people have even described this decision as *the* fundamental question of this type of play.<br/><br/>It probably also means many fewer PC deaths, which is not an insignificant thing for the game's design!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455748/#Comment_455748" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T16:06:38+00:00" title="August 23, 2016  4:06PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, I think there is some good advice here for GM'ing in general as well as perspective to design from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
