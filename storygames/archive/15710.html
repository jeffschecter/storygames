I wanted to pick his brain about adapting them to other genres. Specifically, I'm about to start a weird espionage campaign using the Agents of Oblivion setting for Savage Worlds. I'm interested in turning them into a Potential Assets my players can cultivate, but wasn't sure immediately how.<br/><br/>This got me thinking that I'm probably not the only one who'd like to adapt this idea. And if that's the case, then I'm probably not the only one who wants to bug John with questions.

At any given time (especially in a "sandbox" kind of game) there will be many opportunities in play. It's easy for players to forget about some of them. So, write the opportunities on cards, thrown 'em on the table, and keep them in front of everyone's eyeballs.<br/><br/><i>Depending on the game, an "opportunity" might be a mission, contract, quest, promise, faction goal, debt, etc.</i><br/><br/><b>What goes on the card?</b><br/>The exact details on a card will depend on the specific elements of your game. But in general, this is the template:<br/><br/>- Name of Opportunity<br/>- NPC and/or faction linked to the opportunity<br/>- Location(s) in the game world related to the opportunity<br/>- [Actions involved in addressing the opportunity]<br/>- [Reward for addressing the opportunity]<br/><br/>Those last two are optional, but I like them since they often help players prioritize opportunities and better assess risks and rewards.<br/><br/><b>Organizing the cards</b><br/>Since opportunities are written on cards, it's possible to arrange them how you like. The players might group them into stacks related to factions or locations on the map, by relative challenge, reward offered, or however they please. It's easy to move cards around as they change status, add details when they learn them, discard them when completed, or save them as a record of what's been accomplished.<br/><br/>So, that's the basic idea. I'll talk about specific applications next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356159/#Comment_356159" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T20:31:46+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  8:31PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use a really stripped down version of this in FUBAR...but since I'm looking to expand the concept in an upcoming supplement, I'll be watching this thread with interest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356171/#Comment_356171" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T22:45:45+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 10:45PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey.

I do a very similar thing before most games these days, and especially sandbox-y type games (fantasy, pirates, and pulp, especially):<br/><br/>1) Set a stack of index cards in the center of the table.<br/><br/>2) Before character creation, have everyone take 5-10 minutes to pick up cards and write on them a location (proper name, description, whatever).<br/><br/>3) Return the cards to the center, and then take about 5 minutes to have players pick up location cards and add a threat (a name, a recent event, a plot or conspiracy, etc.). Stop when around half of the location cards have threats.<br/><br/>4) Proceed to character creation and play. Players will often very naturally work some of the locations into their backstories (great!) and we can freely introduce the locations as the whim strikes us throughout the game.<br/><br/>5) Throughout the game, the players are free to add detail to the cards as desired; there's nothing sacred about them, and sometimes they get really marked up with people, connections, plots, and so forth. I also always leave extra blank cards on the table, so we can make a card for a new place if it comes up or so that when a player has an idea he or she can grab one right away and make a new place for inspiration later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356264/#Comment_356264" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T09:44:30+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  9:44AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I suggest that this is fairly similar to The Board in Homicide: Life on the Street?<br/><br/>And thus, it is great?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh" title="Josh_Unruh"><img alt="Josh_Unruh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh">Josh_Unruh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356303/#Comment_356303" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T11:37:03+00:00" title="January 27, 2012 11:37AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Stephen">@Stephen</a> - For games where the worldbuilding can involve the players in such detail, that is VERY clever.

I'm imagining Ben Robbins's West Marches with the move from Red to Black being a bragging point. "How many quests do you have in the Black? You never know if you're going to pull a Dunker or a Red Ball, amiright?"<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/John">@John</a> and everybody - I'm planning a weird espionage thing that's pretty mission focused. But I was thinking of using this tactic to manage information within the mission. If they have to go investigate there's a card that says "Two Fenris agents spotted in New York City. Chatter suggests one is rogue and the other is a known Fenris spycatcher. Recruit the rogue." They can put whatever they want as goals on it, when the story twists, we can mark through stuff and rewrite it.<br/><br/>Regardless, by the end there should be cards that are marked full of information they can keep and use to keep track of the campaign, other major players, etc.<br/><br/>Think the "within a mission" opportunities will work as well as the "used as mission" opportunities?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
