It was often fun, but the older I got, the less time I had to do it.<br/><br/>Finding new-fangled low-prep/no-prep games a few years back was great; my gaming, in general, is more fun and less stressful. Even for  games that require some prep, I'm pretty comfortable winging it.<br/><br/>This past weekend, a bunch of old friends got together for an epic D&amp;D game (we played Dungeon World), and - for whatever reason - I reverted to my old habits. (I even got a little panicked about not having enough cool stuff and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15923&amp;" rel="nofollow">started a thread</a> to solicit ideas.) I ended up with <b>ten pages</b> of adventure notes and monster stats, two different sets of mini-handouts for moves and questions, and a map that I re-drew because the first one didn't look cool enough. I totally nerded out.<br/><br/>And the game was really awesome. <br/><br/>All that prep made for a different experience. I didn't invent much of anything on the fly. I knew what the inn was like, who the townfolk were, what the wounded  fae warrior in the forest had to tell, the bridges, the traps, the dungeon layout, the field of undead - the whole nine yards. I even wrote flavor text. <br/><br/>Having all that info let me bring more inventiveness to the actual encounters in terms of description.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that I plan to go back to this style of GMing. For one thing, there's no way I could spare the time to regularly prep for games like that. Plus I really like the make-it-up-as-you-go school of gaming. But I'm glad I put all that work into my epic D&amp;D reunion game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363646/#Comment_363646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T20:49:01+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man!<br/><br/>Whenever I play games that require (or even allow!) prep these days, I find I have one of two reactions:<br/><br/>1. Wait, what? I have to do work before we even start playing? This is... odd. How did I do this before? Why is it necessary?<br/><br/>and then/or<br/><br/>2. Prep is a certain kind of joy, a fun activity of planning, plotting, and looking forward to seeing your contributions in play. Boy, it can be fun!<br/><br/>So I'm with you. I love both very much.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like is games where the prep is likely to be wasted. That's a major drag, and likely to sabotage your game in insidious ways, I think. When I play a game, I want to know (whether from the book or from experience) what kind of prep will lead to fun in the game, and what kind is unnecessary or even harmful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363650/#Comment_363650" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T20:54:17+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  8:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The prep wasn't really that fun.

There aren't many games so versatile.<br/><br/>But yeah, I do find a certain enjoyment in preparation for my bi-weekly Pathfinder game. I'm using a published Adventure Path, but it still requires a lot of advance reading, note-taking, map-drawing (I use gaming paper and draw all the combat encounter maps ahead of time), etc. I also cut and paste all my campaign notes and the relevant text from the adventure into a text-tree editor on my netbook for easy access during the game, and I kind of love that kind of menial computer task.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363655/#Comment_363655" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T21:04:14+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  9:04PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you just coined the phrase: "Nostalgia Prep".<br/><br/><img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363662/#Comment_363662" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T21:21:32+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  9:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't feel like I did any railroading.

There's an NPC in town who repaired it once, and has something that can disable it.  Otherwise, it's much too big for the PCs to handle and they'll just be retreating the whole time and trying to dodge it's wrath.<br/>So it would be really cool if they talked to people and gathered up some info and figured out an advantage, or else they're gonna get hurt bad.</li>\n</ul>\nI understand that some people like this kinda thing, in that it is a satisfying chain of events either way.  Find info?  Gain advantage!  Charge in?  Get hammered!<br/>But sometimes that kind of prep leads to bad feelings.  Where is the line?  I mean, if the GM expects the PCs to investigate, is it fair to get sore if they ignore the "cool NPC with stuff to say"?  Is it all in the expectation and not the execution?<br/><br/>I'm jealous of having such a fleshed out world though!  Monsters that the PCs don't encounter?  Events that they can engage or ignore?  Cool!  Maybe my problem is that I get too invested in prep.

I read them and go "wait... I'm supposed to prep alone?" There's just something so weird about that, like rolling the dice behind the screen almost (which I never do). With ACKS in particular I had expected rules for starting play with blank paper, rolling and consulting tables as the PCs move in the world.<br/><br/>I've got a very fast imagination (not saying that what I come up with is good, just that it is more or less the same regardless of if I take my time with it or just throw things out there at the table) and I'm also concerned that the players won't believe my prep, that they'd think I'm winging it as usual.<br/><br/>Thirdly: if this story is to be about the world, and not the player characters lives, isn't it a bit strange that I as GM is writing it all beforehand? My world becomes a novel that the players read by visiting its locations. They can find the hidden room or they can miss it, but... they'd be experiencing my show.<br/><br/>That's how it used to be all the time (winged or prepped, it was "enter the GM's world") but I wanted to find a new way of working. Maybe that's futile and I should just get back on the OSR bus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366599/#Comment_366599" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T13:39:06+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  1:39PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think inventing together at the table is great, and it's my preferred way to play.<br/><br/>But inventing beforehand and revealing is also a fun experience, as long as you're entertaining and engaging the other players and not boring the crap out of them and making them read pages of notes.
