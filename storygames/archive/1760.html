                    Sometimes, you can't get time away from your significant other to go gaming when the opportunity presents itself. This can be frustrating. What you have to do is have a bank of "Gaming Tokens" built up so that your better half will let you go gaming.<br/><br/>What methods have you Story Gamers found to increase your bank (e.g. easy-to-do daytrips, recipes, etc.)?                </div>

                            Are Gaming Tokens things for your SO to do while you game so they don't mind your leaving, or are you talking about what my wife and I call "Husband Points," i.e., an amassed pool of goodwill that can be exchanged for gaming?

Okay, lemme think...<br/><br/>* In general, I try to be a nice guy. I help around the house, am the one who gets up at 5:30am to feed the pets, mows the lawn, all that stuff. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>* Encourage her to populate our Netflix queue with ANY MOVIE SHE DAMN WELL WANTS, which, if you knew my wife's tolerance for really bad romantic comedies and family dramas,would be very impressive. The upside is that this forms a pool of films she can watch on my game nights.<br/><br/>* Make a point to, on my "off weekends" (I've clustered my group's schedules together), go out with her and do fun things *she* wants to do: dine at her favorite restaurants, visit with her family, shopping where she likes to shop, etc. (Which, to be clear, I enjoy. I love spending time with my wife. But I think we all know how easy it is to fall into ruts.)<br/><br/>* Encourage her to make her own plans. Since I have my groups on a regular schedule, she always knows in advance when I won't be home. This makes it easier for her to plan things with her friends and family. It also means I'm never leaving her in the lurch at the last minute.<br/><br/>* Support her hobbies and pursuits. My wife does volunteer work, and is also a spades fanatic. I help and encourage her as much as possible. Heck, she helps me brainstorm RPG stuff as well as listen to me bitch about my groups, so it's the least I can do.<br/><br/>* Happy Bonus: My wife has made friends with a lot of the SOs from my groups, so they often get together to do fun things while we game.<br/><br/>I think those are the big ones. I'm lucky in that we're both very independent people; neither of us is unhappy being alone or unable to find things to do by ourselves. The fact that we allow each other "personal time" makes our "together time" that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>(Also, we had moved just before I hooked up with my current gaming buds. We were far from many of my old friends, and I was apparently become kind of a homebody as a result. Joining some gaming groups basically made me a whole new circle of friends and improved my disposition a lot. I think my wife sees how happy and outgoing my hobby makes me (and has found very good friends among the other SOs), and thus encourages it.)<br/><br/>Basically, my wife rocks. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>

Even though we both know these things and practice them, I'm hoping this thread will serve for others who don't see these things automatically. I'm also looking for things I've been blind to. Thanks for bearing with me.

This is the problem I, in particular, am having. She sees my encouragement as pushing her away, and she has very few hobbies. But enough about me, good stuff, keep it coming!                        </div>

                            We call them "coupons" around here.  And I've opted out of the coupon economy - my wife and I understand that gaming is important to me, and she'd rather be with me when I want to be with her.  The reverse is also true, and she's got enthusiasms of her own.  It works pretty well, and when it doesn't I default to hanging with her over hanging with the miserable yeggs I game with.                        </div>

                            Yeah, actually after a certain point the balance built up on both sides gets large enough that you stop counting (as it were). It's a metaphor we used early on but getting on for eight years in, it's not been mentioned for a while.<br/><br/>The "understanding what is important to your partner" is a big one. I stayed home from an event (not gaming) that I would normally have gone to because her parents were over (from overseas), for example, and there was no debate about it; I just knew that was how it had to go. <br/><br/>You have to make sure that she feels she has enough time with you, too. If "enough time" for her equals pretty much all the time you've got, though, then you have a problem, and I don't know the answer to it. Therapy?<br/><br/>(I'm not being facetious, actually. Some people, for entirely legitimate reasons rooted in the past, have anxieties which manifest as not wanting people who are important to them to be absent. No blame attaches, and I'm not diagnosing your situation by remote control, Mark - very likely the dynamic is other than this. But a good analytical hypnotherapist, to promote my own hopefully-future profession, can sort stuff like this out in surprisingly quick time.)                        </div>

                            here's some advise from the unmarried, but commited mind.<br/><br/>slowly increase your alcohol tolerance by doing a shot or two right before bed. Then whenever she (we're talking about women folk here, right?) drinks, water it down some (i keep a small flask of sours mix hidden on my person at all times for this purpose) so that her tolerance slowly decreases over time. Then on your gaming night drink em under the table, get them royaly wasted, like can't talk or remember things or sit up straight drunk. Then just game a little buzzed.<br/><br/>But thats just my way.<br/><br/>Also, morningstar has it right, thats the way to do it, not my way.                        </div>

Often, it'll depend on how much the SO will allow. Even if all you're looking for is four hours a month, if that's too much for the SO, it's too much. Really, it gets back to what Mike was talking about. It's either an issue (in which any time taken away from the SO is unacceptable to them) or it's not (you give each other a comfortable amount of space for your relationship).                        </div>

                            When Dave (my boyfriend/partner) started making grumbling noises about how much time I was spending gaming (and really, I don't blame him, seeing as for a few weeks this fall I was sometimes gaming twice a week for 8-10 hour stretches), I started making it a point to schedule some "us time" at some point during the week as well.  He has a lot of other interests that take him out of the house, too, so that helps, and it was actually good to make sure that we actively planned on having time together during the week, since with both of our schedules it sometimes wasn't happening.  Also, I find it helps soften him up if when I pick up a six-pack for an evening gaming session, I pick up some particularly nice stout or something for him as well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  He's not an entirely non-gaming SO, anyway; he did D&amp;D in highschool and college, and recently we both started gaming together with another group once a month.  He's just not as fanatical as I am.                        </div>

                            I find having a schedule planned out in advance is a huge help. Advance scheduling is a courtesy that you SO will appreciate, and it also encourages advance planning of things to do as a couple, i.e., dates.<br/><br/>Sorry to be so repetitive. I'm just really enjoying this thread.                        </div>

                            Another thing that helps is having a cool group that understands when you can't make it.  My gaming enjoyment has greatly increased when my group just made a game that we can play when I do show up and have another game that they can play when I can't make it.  It has taken a lot of the stress out of gaming for me (since between work and family and moving an hour away from the group I can only make it maybe twice a month).                        </div>

                            My problem is that, due to driving distances and other practical matters, I can only get my gaming group together on Saturdays and Sundays, which happen to be the same days that I do daytime stuff with the wife and the same days we do house stuff, visit relatives, and so on. It's hard to make the time. I negotiated every other weekend with her as my time, and I don't always use it. Lately, I've given up fun stuff for more important stuff like electioneering and studying for a Java certification, but I theoretically have the time for gaming (and other stuff) if I want it.<br/><br/>I had two of my players decline an invitation to play D&amp;D last Saturday because they're big U. Texas football fans. Whatever. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But that's a different problem.                        </div>

                            I game too, but there were *years* when Vincent was heavily involved in games I was no part of. Here's my list of stuff that helps.<br/><br/>Be On Time - the absolute number one thing that helps me be cool with it, then and now, is promptness. If you (generic partner) can say "I'm going out to game with XYZ, and I'll be back at 11:30" and then you are actually home at 11:30, that shows me you are serious about keeping your agreements, I don't worry (as much <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ) about you being dead in a ditch, and I don't feel taken advantage of by you rolling in an hour+ late because you 'lost track of time'. Being on time 90+ percent of the time also lets me chill when you're a bit late because of traffic, a stop for gas, got talking about important stuff, etc. <br/><br/>Call Ahead if you're going to be late - see above. And if you're calling more than 25% of the time, maybe renegotiate a more realistic time to be back.<br/><br/>Stay Informed - Keep a big public wall calender, and have things scheduled well in advance. that way we can both see what the reality of activity is. That way everyone knows not to schedule gaming against a concert or a kid's thing, and not to plan a family movie or fancy dinner on a game night. If you're getting two hours every other week to game, I can easily see that's really a tiny sliver of time, and we can make some adjustments to give you more time. If you've got three 10 hour sessions a month blocked out for your gaming without me, that should be a red flag on the calender that maybe time for 'us', 'house', 'family', etc is getting short shrift. In our house, there've been times when Vincent had a regular ~7 pm to midnight deal every week on a week-day, so weekends were still free for other stuff.<br/><br/>Support My Interests - Time that you are out gaming is time I am the sole person handling house/kid/pet stuff. Understand that I'm going to want time to do my stuff too, and that's not always happening when there are dishes to do and diapers to change and dogs to walk. I have creative drive churning out of my head right now, but I spend big chunks of each day actively parenting, so I get very little time to actually *do* my stuff. Support means not only "Sure, honey, go do whatever." but realize I may want to tell you as much about my stuff as you do about gaming, I may spend as much money on it, and it has as much meaning to me as gaming does to you. If I feel like you're just interested in buying me off or getting me distracted, I might wind up resenting the whole deal. <br/><br/>Check before you say Yes - If you check with me before agreeing to a game, I feel considered and respected.<br/><br/>Ask for what you want - just like you, I can't read minds. Just like you, I find confidence and courtesy attractive, and insecurity and wheedling annoying. "I got invited to go over to Joe's after work for a quick 3-hour game of SAH-Roach. We'd grab a pizza and I'd be home by 10. Is there anything on our calender for tonight?" is going to to be waaaaay better for both of us than "Honey, can I please go out on Saturday? I'll do the dishes before I go, and I'll get you some ice cream and  movie. I havn't been out yet this month, and besides, we're going to your garden thing on Sunday." In the first, I can say "Sure, have fun" or "We've got a date with the grochery store" or "I'd really like to just be home tonight; can you go next time?" In the second, I can say "No" and come off as an unreasonable jailer or "Yes" and feel bought and resentful.                        </div>

                            Meg put into words some things that I was having trouble articulating.<br/><br/>I've never had a problem negotiating gaming time with my girlfriend. Usually I say "Listen, the first week of December, there's a convention on: have we got anything on?". If there's something really important, then I'll have to miss the convention; otherwise, she uses that weekend to go visit people.<br/><br/>Similarly, sometimes she'll have something on for a weekend, so she tells me, and I use that weekend to visit my parents.<br/><br/>Then, closer to the time, we make sure that we have a nice meal or something before I go. For example, if I'm going away on the Saturday, we'll have a meal on Friday night. Not necessarily a restaurant meal: perhaps we'll get something nice and cook it.<br/><br/><i>Alternatively</i>, I'll say "I've got a gaming convention: want to come?" and she'll say "No, it's all right, go by yourself". Problem solved!<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

Seconded.<br/><br/>I mean, what everyone has been saying boils down to "Be considerate and communicate" (which is pretty good advice for any human relationship with anyone, actually). But Meguey's post shows us concretely what that actually looks like.                        </div>
