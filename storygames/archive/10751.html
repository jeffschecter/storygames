Because I'm seeing gorillas, riding pterodactyls, with harpoon guns, stealing a boat."</blockquote></blockquote>\nWhich in turn gave me an idea:\n<blockquote>As the PCs roll into a new town, each makes an observation and asks "Are you seeing what I'm seeing?" That gives each player an easy way to confirm, clarify or augment that observation until everyone comes to an agreement about what that town is like. It establishes a baseline from which any deviation may be considered gonzo.</blockquote>\nSo this is a very loose idea, but it seems like the start of Polaris-like branching discussion of ritual phrases.<br/><br/>"I see some elves meditating on the tips of branches overhead. Are you seeing what I'm seeing?"<br/>"Yup. And over there are some priests of the elf god praying for the arrival of saviors from a malevolent entity.

Roleplaying has different needs.  While a "no blocking" rule might work well in some cases, in others...blocking is a good thing.  There are only two ways to manage a consistant vision.  One is the Vulcan Mindmeld where everyone at the table is so perfectly attuned to the exact same thing that it just works.  The other is to block things that are too far outside of the vision to be absorbed effectively.  If nobody has the power to block...then the vision eventually frays or is diluted to the point of being unrecognizable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts different when everyone is just interested in riffing off of ideas and seeing where it goes, and every road is just as good as any other.  But when you sit down at a table to achieve a specific thing but don't have any recourse response...then essentially everyone is held hostage to the individual whim of everyone else.  Which in some applications is cool.  It can be good to be forced out of a comfort zone and have to creatively respond to something out of left field.  But other times its ass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238580/#Comment_238580" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T12:32:16+00:00" title="October 21, 2009 12:32PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Penny's Facts and Reassurances provide a good start to that consistent vision.

Keeping the momentum up in a game can often add to the enjoyment of the game.  I'd prefer the players accept a fact about the world and move on, rather than have to listen to players argue over the specific mating habits of owlbears.  That being said, it's <i>less</i> of an issue than it is in improv, and it is okay to discuss facts to some degree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238675/#Comment_238675" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T01:00:16+00:00" title="October 22, 2009  1:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Ryan, can you elaborate on that a bit?
