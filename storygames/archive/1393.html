                    Here I go, asking for the collective awesomeness of what I've seen Story Games pull off.<br/><br/>I'm planning on playing some D&amp;D 3.x, myself as DM and four players. None of us have played D&amp;D in a while (I think some of them haven't <i>roleplayed</i> in a while), so we'll start at 1st level to get us acquainted with the rules.<br/><br/>I've been burned (on both sides of the screen) with pre-packaged adventures, so I'd like to keep things somewhat loose, inspired by my own positive D&amp;D experiences as a kid and Ron Edward's recent <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20257.0" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Actual Play</a>. I'm planning on playing the traditional combat-heavy D&amp;D sessions, but allowing for player freedom rather than railroady module play.<br/><br/>To this end, my gameplan is this:
<ul>
<li><i>Character Generation</i>: PCs are created as members of the Empire's "special forces" group, assigned specific band-of-hero-quality tasks (i.e., "The fishermen of Shadowbay are reporting strange shark demon attacks. Investigate, stop them if possible, and report back to us.").</li>
<li><i>Character Generation</i>: This "special forces" group provides a magical signet which informs the Empire when its owner is killed, so a new character can be sent to help with the task (illusion-izing "roll a new character").</li>
<li><i>Play Prep</i>: Set up a relationship map around the task. "The demons are actually a single wereshark. The wereshark (as a human) is betrothed to the daughter of Shadowbay's mayor. The mayor's wife is sleeping with the priest. The mayor's wife is a dark priest, whose disciple is the wereshark."</li>
<li><i>Play Prep</i>: Prepare NPC stats, monster stats, combat location maps.</li>
<li><i>Play Prep</i>: Write up some Sorcerer &amp; Sword-style Bangs to spice up the task at hand (betrayals, surprise attacks, wrenches in the task, etc)</li>
<li><i>During Play</i>: Begin every non-combat scene with an explicit "What do you want to accomplish here?" Following whatever skill checks are needed (Diplomacy, Bluff, whatever), so long as it doesn't lead into combat, the scene ends as soon as the accomplishment is <i>made, the PCs give up, impossible, or the PC's goal shifts during the scene</i>.</li>
<li><i>During Play</i>: Use the <b>Yes/No, And/But</b> philosophy.  Something like, "A roll of 11-20 provides positive benefits to your success/failure, a roll of 1-10 provides consquences".<br/></li><li><i>After a Session</i>: Reserve 15 minutes for discussing what went right/wrong, what people liked and didn't like.</li>
<li><i>After a Task</i>: Divvy out XP at an advanced rate, since we're only meeting once or twice a month.</li>
</ul>
I'm <i>hopeful</i> that my above prep will allow for a "reactionary" GMing style, moving from scene to scene as dictated by play, not by flowchart. But I'm <i>worried</i> because my experience with D&amp;D points to a system that requires a lot of heavy preparation: Flowcharted modules, fully detailed maps with room-by-room descriptions, etc. <br/><br/><b>So my question for y'all is this:</b> With my desired play style goal, are there any tips, tricks, pitfalls, etc. that I can put in my DMing toolbox? It seems there are a good number of D&amp;D-heads here who can help me out.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>

                            Here's a trick:  Replace "A roll of 11-20 provides benefits, a roll of 1-10 provides consequences" with "A roll of 6-20 provides benefits, a roll of 1-15 provides consequences."  Or, y'know, overlap them by less than ten points.  You can tailor that to the kind of division you want between "Fail with consequences," "Succeed with consequences," and "Succeed without consequences."                        </div>

                            I meant that the raw d20 roll provides the benefits/consequences (and/but). And the roll + modifiers vs. DC provides the success/failure (yes/no). Unless I'm reading you wrong?                        </div>

                            I think you're reading me wrong.  I'm saying that benefits and consequences don't have to be mutually exclusive.  It's fun to have some overlap:  Yes, the princess loves you yet more, <i>but also</i> the Black Baron swears bloody vengeance on you, you swashbuckling rapscallion!                        </div>

In my experience, investigations with a traditional system almost always mean reactive PCs.  If they want to investigate the shark attacks, and you as GM have written up the real explanation, then they have to follow where you lead them.  If you really want to be reactive as a GM, give them your relationship map and notes at the start of the game.  If they know about what is going on, then they can lead you where they want to go.  If they don't know what is there, then they're going to be searching around for what you give them.                        </div>

                            I think you're fine, Zak. <br/><br/>As John says, investigations are problematic. The key is to make each "discovery" scene actually about something else. That is, have the unfolding mystery be the backdrop to the real drama. <br/><br/>So, let's say with the characters you have, that a bang is having the priestess approach a character to ask them to join her cult. She doesn't reveal everything, but only a bit about it. This revelation moves the investigation forward, and is automatic. The real drama of the scene is the temptation of the character to join with her. <br/><br/>See what I'm getting at? Come up with a number of clues that, when put together, will make it obvious what's going on. Then simply have these all come out automatically alongside the bangs. Basically always be trying to give away the mystery, but make the process of doing so interesting. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Good point.  I was coming at it from the point of view that the mystery aspect wasn't necessarily central to your game.  But if you want to keep the mystery to a degree, then I agree with Mike's advice.  Just note that relationship maps don't have to be hidden to still be fun.                        </div>

                            I get you. So rather than a "Investigate XYZ," throw the players <i>into</i> XYZ.<br/><br/>I do want a cohesive party, hence the "You're all agents of the Empire" type thing, so it's not a total Sorcerer &amp; Sword style "Here's your Kickers, now here's a bunch of Bangs!" (not at all to deride that style of play!) But rather, "Here's what your group has been assigned to accomplish," followed up by complications during play. So in this case, this "assignment" is the backdrop behind which the bangs unfold.<br/><br/>If the assignment is "Investigate the demon shark complaints in Shadowbay," potential bangs could then be:
<ul><li>(Mike's): The priestess approaches a PC and asks them to join her cult.</li>
<li>The priest is discovered desecrating his own church in some way, and tries to subdue the party.</li>
<li>The daughter has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper's boat is sailing to the Sunken Abbey (where the priestess' god sleeps).</li>
<li>A victim of the demon shark rows to shore, and is attacked by dominated giant crabs on shore. The victim holds a necklace bearing the Mayor's family seal.</li></ul>
And Tony, I get you now. I like it! Thanks for clarifying.                        </div>
