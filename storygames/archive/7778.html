I ran it as a pick-up game this past Saturday.  It was awesome fun.  Thought I'd share my opening.  If you're interested I can follow-up with what PCs were chosen and the outcome of the game.  Let me know if there's interest...<br/><br/><br/>Thoughts??<br/><br/><br/><br/><div><b>The CITY:</b><br/><span style="color: #CC0033;"><b>She's a busy port on da parched planet of Tatooine... MOS EISLEY.</b><br/><i>Da Mos attracts a force-loada beings from all over da galaxy, okay... <br/>Many of dem from da wrong side of da Empire. Criminal records aren't all dey have <br/>in common, okay -- dey all gotsa desire for cold drink, a swingin' tune, some fine Twi'lek-tail <br/>and some blessed shade to brings dem into da seedy cantina near da center of town. Day ares some <br/>of da scruffiest people and seedier tings you'll find dis sidea Nar Shadda, okay... Dey say da force don't go down <br/>nare. Nuttin but luck an a good blaster at yer side 'ill do... But den again, in my experience, dare's no such ting as luck, okay. <br/>So who's more fool? Da fool or da fool dat follows 'im down Mos Eisley spaceport? <br/>You never find a more wretched hivea scum an villainy. <br/>You be cautious nerf herder...</i></span></div><br/><div><b>GTS: Mos Eisley</b></div><br/><br/>So, the Emperor is dead and the Imperial forces are starting to fall into disarray.<br/>The Rebel Alliance is getting bolder in its activities - openly claiming rulership of some territories and members announcing their loyalty to the rebel cause.<br/>Tatoonie has always been a backwater. The Old Republic didn't really care about us, neither did the Empire, and the Rebels? Well I'll be pleased as punch if the "New Republic" ever shows up.<br/>But don't you ever think we don't take care of our own.<br/>The Tatoonie Marshalls have been keeping this sandball safe... well, reasonably safe... since before the last Republic was founded. Who do you think keeps the Tuskens out in the desert? Who do you think keeps things ticking? Who do the moisture farmers turn to when they need help? Us. That's who.<br/>Sure, there is corruption. Sure, we are understaffed, underfunded and outgunned. But that just makes us dedicated. And a dedicated man is the most dangerous thing in the universe.<br/>Jabba's dead? Jabba IS dead - allegedly killed by the rebels - and with only a wavering imperial presence on the streets, pitched battles by criminal gangs trying to fill the Hutt's void are tearing the city apart. Everyone is looking for a piece of the action, and they don't care who they step on?<br/>With the Rebels, now the so called New Republic, about to lay claim to rulership and the rest of the Imperial loyalists still thinking they're in charge there's a load of bantha-poodoo coming down...<br/>Sycophantic Hutt loyalists, Speeder bike gangs, Imperial double-agents, Well equipped corporate teams from the Core who want a piece of the Tattooine pie, Jawas who will fence anything, "The Perfect Hideout", except it's in the area of some territorial Tuskens (or maybe a Krayt Dragon), bounty hunter bogeyman, slavery, spice rackets, extortion, sabacc games, pod races, you know, the usual stuff.<br/><br/>PCs can be:<br/>a mix of ex-imperials and criminal scum all trying to carve out a chunk of Mos Eisley for themselves in the wake of Jabba's death. Each PC could be working his/her own agenda on the side. With a lot of room for intrigue, clandestine meetings and lots of secrets.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172444/#Comment_172444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T15:28:11+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  3:28PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2008 3:29PM by kevperrine.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>OPENING SCENE...</b></span><br/>----------------------------------<br/><b>Dex's Diner, CoCo Town, Coruscant -- 4 ABY</b><br/>[Seen from orbit, it's like a blaze of light and sparkling colors, reminding some spacers of corusca stones, after which this planet was named long ago.
