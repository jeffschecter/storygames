We were trying to do a bit of campaign burning for a one-on-one game that I have been fixing to play, and we had gotten to the point where we were discussing the BW magic system, sorcery in particular. Eric (my friend) has a long history of playing wizards and spell-casters in many different systems, from traditional games like DnD and Shadowrun, to indie games like Burning Wheel and Sorcer. He likes magic. A lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a bit of humming and hawing over the prevalence of magic in our setting we got on a tangent about how difficult regular sorcery is in Burning Wheel, and how the consequences for failure can be pretty great. Let me see if I can be a bit more clear:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn BW, players mostly roll to achieve their intent for a particular scene. If I am in a combat (not using the Fight! rules), then I will make one Sword roll, and that will dictate if I succeed at whatever my intent is for that entire fight. The rules are similar for social situations and other physical obstacles (using the Let It Ride rules). The great part about BW is that failure doesn't necessarily mean your character totally biffs at what he is trying to accomplish; the GM is allowed to give the player his intent, but create further complications based on the character's failed roll. This is the reason I love this game so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Eric feels that there is a disconnect with Sorcery rules, and to a point, I agree with him. When it comes to Sorcery, you are rolling to resolve a particular task, and <i>only</i> that task. For example, in one scene, a wizard might be about to face some orcs, and he wants to cast Turn Aside the Blade (a spell) to make it harder for the orcs to hit him. His intent for the scene is to defeat the orcs. Thus, just casting the spell is not sufficient to succeed on his intent; he will need to also succeed on a Sword roll, or some other skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general thrust of his argument is that an expert warrior who faces down all of these orcs gets to make a sword roll, and even if he fails, he can still be described as valiantly fighting them off, felling a few, and then being overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The warrior character is still "cool" in the player's eyes. A wizard who casts his spell and fails just...fails. Sure, after that he can try to fight off the orcs anyway, and be described in a heroic way like the warrior above, but that is not so with his failed spellcasting roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor him, the rules of BW Sorcery ruin some of the "cool factor" for playing a badass spell-slinging mage. Sure, they might be capable of great power, but oftentimes, they struggle to even <i>cast</i> a spell, much less succeed on whatever they are trying to accomplish. He asserts that this disconnect serves to 'de-protagonize' the sorcerer character-type.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am not sure what to think of the argument above. I am not even entirely sure that it's coherent or well founded, but it is something we need to hash through before we finish our campaign burning, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I wanted to ask peoples' opinions on this matter. Do you feel that this subsystem, or other subsystems in different games do this? Are some characters made to seem 'less heroic' because their subset of rules make them fail more often?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that's clear. I would be happy to try and make my questions a bit more coherent, if necessary, but really, I don't know what to think about the matter. Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207926/#Comment_207926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T10:08:17+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 10:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intent in Burning Wheel governs tasks, not scenes.<br><br>A roll in Burning Wheel involves an Intent and a Task.

Let me see if I can be a bit more clear on what Eric was trying to tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith many spells, you cast them to help you with achieving a different thing that you intend to do. I cast Turn Aside the Blade to help me win a combat. I cast the spell that boosts my social skills to help me win an argument. In both of those cases, spell-casting is being used as a means to achieve something else. Failure means that the spell just <i>doesn't work</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nNon-spellcasters who specialize in other areas make a combat or social roll to succeed at their intent, and even if they fail, their "failure" can be narrated in such a way where they might still "succeed" at fighting or arguing, but complications make their situation more difficult or less than ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding your question, I don't see how that is permissible within the constraints of the rules in the brown and red books. If a wizard only has a collection of a few spells to pick from, why would a versus sorcery test be used to resolve a scene, when they spent a hefty amount of resource points on specific spells with specific parameters that have definite Ob numbers to cast?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207935/#Comment_207935" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T10:19:11+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 10:19AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (sorry, I missed Caesar's post)<br/>\n<br/>\nCaesar_X -- I agree that our terminology is probably wrong, and see no need to argue the point.

After dropping a few, two more ambush you from behind, and despite your best efforts, you are disarmed and captured."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the latter case, the character is still succeeding at doing <i>something</i>, but his overall intent (fighting off all the orcs) fails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207943/#Comment_207943" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T10:39:25+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 10:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2009 10:39AM by Thor_O.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie G</cite>With many spells, you cast them to help you with achieving a different thing that you intend to do.

When you're casting Turn Aside the Blade, your intent is to protect yourself from harm. Turn Aside the Blade can't win a combat.<br><br>With standard Sorcery, your Intent is largely governed by the spells you select (it's different with other types of magic presented in the Magic Burner).

If you choose Avoid, then your intent is to protect yourself from harm.<br><br>Standard Sorcery has one additional wrinkle in that part of the failure result is dictated. If you fail to cast your spell, you must roll a Die of Fate to see whether the spell simply has no effect, whether it was miscast in some way (using the Wheel of Magic that Paul mentioned), or whether there was an unwanted summoning.

Treat it like any other versus test. Note, if your only spell is Turn Aside the Blade, you wouldn't use sorcery if your intent is to win a fight. Turn Aside the Blade just doesn't do that.

It's usually strategic and not tactical, with a handful of notable exceptions. Personally I would consider an 11-action spell with the potential to completely nerf anyone's attempt to hit him with anything a strategic choice. If your sorcerer feels "deprotagonized," imagine what the badass swordsman's player feels when you've just jacked him with a +4Ob all scene long.<br><br>And finally, there's the meta-discussion about magic in MagBu, p. 248.

I do not wish to examine under the lens of Fight mechanics or Duel of Wits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll right, the way we have interpreted the BW resolution system for standard tasks is as such:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player states their intent and says how they want to achieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM will assign an obstacle, and maybe explicitly state consequences for failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, the stakes are set.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, success means the character succeeds on their intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, if the character fails his roll, this can be represented in the fiction a few different ways. One way is that the character can still be narrated as performing whatever task they were attempting in an admirable, heroic, and seemingly succesful way, but unforeseen complications arise that prevent them from achieving their intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe merit of resolving a failure this way is that the character isn't portrayed as being incompetent; they did everything they could (and did it well), but due to circumstances beyond their immediate control, they did not succeed in getting exactly what they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, look at Sorcery. In most cases (even with the DoF roll), when a sorcerer fails his spell-casting roll, that's it. He just fails. Nothing happens. If things do happen, like unwanted summonings or crazy spell modifications, these events are far different than what the character intended to do in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is that it is possible to have a non-sorcerous character who fails every roll he ever makes, yet still be portrayed as competent.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider a character who fails a Stealthy roll. The fiction might say that he cleverly snuck into a goblin stronhold, but he stumbled across a patrol that he didn't expect to see, or got caught in unfamiliar territory that was not on his map, and was spotted by a sentry. After that, he tries to fight them off with his Sword skill in order to escape, but fails. The fiction might say that he wades into the melee, dropping half of the goblins, but eventually he is overwhelmed and captured. Later he tries to use his Lockpick skill to get out of his shackles, and fails his roll. The fiction might state that even though he is an expert at lockpicking, and he tries everything he absolutely can, the lock is simply too rusted to get out of.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all of the rolls above, the character didn't fail at his intent because he wasn't competent enough (in the fiction). He failed at his intent because of other factors such as being outnumbered, or environmental conditions that he did not have control over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Sorcery, there doesn't seem to be quite the same depth of possibilities for failed rolls. You either fail completely at casting your spell, and nothing happens, OR your character does something that is not even close to what he intended (unwanted summonings or wheel of magic transformations).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207963/#Comment_207963" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T11:44:14+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 11:44AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see.

Might that sort of thing work in general? It seems similar to "you cleverly sneak, but that one moment when unforseen circumstance require you sneak more, you fail" and "you successfully dispatch half the goblins with your swordplay but it's not enough". It's not really much like "the lock turned out to be impossibly rusted".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207965/#Comment_207965" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T11:51:40+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 11:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2009 11:54AM by Charlie Gilb.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GreedyAlgorithm- You got it.
