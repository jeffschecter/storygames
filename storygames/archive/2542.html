We've had attendance issues lately, so I've been thinking about starting a 'secondary' game we can play when don't have a quorum of players for the main story.  I see this as a great opportunity to introduce them to more Narr or indie-style gameplay (which I suspect they will all really dig, once they've tried it out).<br/><br/>I have limited experience with indie games myself (I've played The Mountain Witch and Shab Al-Hiri Roach), and I was wondering if anyone could suggest a game that would meet two criteria: <br/><br/>1) A SG-style game that is great for people new to that play-style.<br/><br/>2) A game that will work well for one of two possible game concepts.<br/><br/>In our 'primary' game, the PCs are vigilantes in a pre-Batman, 1920s-flavored Gotham City.  It's a plot-heavy game that focuses on the PCs efforts to stop the mobster-related violence that plagues the city.  <br/><br/>For the 'secondary' game, I have two game concepts in mind. <br/><br/>First idea: the PCs are convicts at Blackgate Prison that are plotting a jailbreak.  The game would focus on character status within the prison and perhaps trust/relationships between characters.  <br/><br/>The second idea: the PCs are beat cops trying to keep the streets of their neighborhood safe, while juggling with politics within their precinct and the GCPD as a whole (think LA Confidential or The Shield).  <br/><br/>Or, if anyone has some other awesome ideas for a secondary story, I would love to hear them.<br/><br/>Anyways, thanks in advance for your thoughts.  Feel free to plug your own games, if you think it would meet my needs! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58525/#Comment_58525" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T12:19:24+00:00" title="March  1, 2007 12:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DitV mechanics have been used for cops and lawman.

The default setting may be a bit too similar to the game you've got going now (the batman-ish one), since it's all about 1920's pulp.  It is, however, pretty easy to modify for other settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBurning Wheel might be a good bet for similar reasons - Luke has described it as a "gateway" into indie gaming, and I agree.  When I introduced it, it was so well received that <i>every single one</i> of my play group went out and bought their own copy.  Oh, and so did the game store owner who overheard us talking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to go with more purely Forge-style games, Primetime Adventures is tough to go wrong with as long as your players watch some TV drama.  If anyone's a fan of Lost or Battlestar Galactica or Buffy/Angel, I'd definitely give it a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it sounds like you're having attendance troubles, InSpectres might also be a good one to try - it's rules are made with a revolving cast of players in mind, so it's great as a back-up game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie" title="RoninZombie"><img alt="RoninZombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RoninZombie">RoninZombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58546/#Comment_58546" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T14:07:36+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  2:07PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the suggestions so far.  I wish Spirit of the Century had been on my radar sooner.  It sounds perfect for our game.  I original planned to use White Wolf's Adventure! (the Storyteller version, not the d20 version), but found so many tweaks necessary to make it work that we just went with a fairly open-ended, home-brew system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58547/#Comment_58547" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T14:09:16+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  2:09PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Malcolm's <i>Cold City</i> (from <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/products.php?publisherLink=contestedGround" rel="nofollow">Contested Ground</a>) does a really good job of building on the trust mechanics that Tim put forward in <i>The Mountain Witch</i>.  It's set amidst post-WWII espionage, but I honestly think it would adapt pretty well to either of your 1920's Gotham premises.  It also seems like the kind of relatively rules light cross-over game that you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
