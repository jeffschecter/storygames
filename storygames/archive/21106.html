Nice to hear that the forums have been helpful. Nowadays forums in general are something of a down-trending thing, so SG can be viewed as something of a relic. I've been party to more than one discussion questioning the point of keeping the lights on here at all [grin].<br/><br/>Tonight was the 50th session of the latest "leg" of our long-running historical campaign. I promised the players that they could have any adventure they wanted for the sake of the celebration, and what do they want? Another dinky little troll cave affair in the middle of the wilderness. I would have imagined that the last two or three troll caves would have already taught them that there's only trolls and troll shit in those caves, with minimal treasure. At least the evil team they run occasionally can enslave some trolls and make a profit that way, but no, they take the holy mcholy contingent in there instead.

It's something I would give a shot if the complexity were dialed down a bit. Barbarians of Lemuria is one I definitely enjoy.<br/><br/>Regarding "design takeaways" from the OSR:<br/><br/>1. Minimal rules focuses gameplay. Consider "moves" from PBtA. Everything outside of those moves is handled by the fiction. The OSR is largely silent on mechanics outside of attacks and saving throws, or they are exception-based (spells, monstrous abilities, magic items).<br/><br/>2. XP for treasure creates an (ingenious) feedback loop incentivizing expected gameplay.

To me the "core" is... somewhere else entirely (a deliberately hollow core, probably - a well-crafted shell engulfing a "fruitful void"). I also parse "moves" as something broader than "when you get to roll dice" - <i>most </i>moves made in a game don't actually involve rolling dice - while I believe it's really important that <i>only some specifically designated moves</i> make use of dice (and it's important largely because that's half or more of how the game conveys its <i>setting</i>).<br/>I'm bringing this up because I'm now wondering whether we really are of a different mind, or we're actually looking at different games. I'm basing my opinions strictly on <i>Apocalypse World</i>; were you rather thinking of DW or some other "pbta" game? I noticed that the differences between them are all but trivial, but I don't have any serious actual play experience to confirm that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463037/#Comment_463037" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T15:56:13+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  3:56PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello, Rafu.<br/><br/>Vincent Baker himself has basically stated what I said above, iirc. The moves are a layer on top of the core mechanics. AW/pbta is essentially a conflict resolution system based on 3-dice outcomes and the (usually) 4 stats as modifiers (plus the whole thing about the GM never rolling and NPCs not using the same descriptions as characters, etc). The playbooks themselves are not a necessary core either. He said that he was surprised not more games have ditched playbooks yet (unfortunately I don't know where I read this stuff. I think it was an interview. The "core" stuff is at the Barf Forth forum somewhere).<br/><br/>What the playbooks do is add "setting and feel", as you point out. The moves do the same. They codify stuff that is common to do in a particular game and makes it much easier to run than just looking at raw results and adjudicating from there. This is the reason why people come up with their own moves for stuff they find themselves doing all the time or that fleshes out their style of gameplay. I remember a nice example I found on the webs (don't remember where) where someone wanted a "piratey" move for swinging from ropes and stuff. Instead of pulling it out of their asses every time with Defy Danger, they just created a thematically appropriate move to help adjudicate results with more specific outcomes. This is basically all there is to moves in pbta.<br/><br/>By the way, have you read "Simple World"? It's around the webs somewhere. Check it out. It's pbta sans playbooks or moves, iirc. Stripped to its core.<br/><br/>Now obviously, if you add/change/subtract moves, then the game will play differently. That's actually what I'm thinking of doing with DW. I haven't played it yet, but although I love pbta and the combat mechanics are exactly what I want, dungeon exploration in DW seems way too facilitated by stuff like Sprout Lore, Defy Danger, and some of the classes moves. The Delver compendium class in Perilous Wilds, for example, is a fucking joke on dungeon exploration. DW also emphasises rations but doesn't care about torches/lamps and timing, which is an important element. Can you imagine running Barrowmaze without caring about illumination? Me neither. Dungeons seem to be mostly a vehicle for setting cool scenes in DW. Like Eero said in another thread, DW is a story-game with a fetish for dungeons. The <i>exploration</i> element is not really there, it's just scenario. Right now I'm a bit disappointed with DW. The game is called DUNGEON World, for fucks sake. I believe it's possible to combine pbta mechanics with old school dungeoneering, but I'm going to have to hack DW to my tastes. I need to keep the character centred stuff outside of dungeons but the old school element inside.<br/><br/>I guess I just digressed there O_o                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463041/#Comment_463041" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T16:25:06+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  4:25PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2017 4:27PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Vincent Baker himself has basically stated what I said above, iirc.

I'm not sure how that's not "objective-focused", though (isn't "get treasure" the objective?), so if the distinction is important, could you elaborate?</blockquote>\nBest example I can think of is from Curse of Strahd. Just wrapped up GMing that campaign. The manual suggests using "milestones" for leveling up. In the module, Madam Eva (a Vistani, the setting's stand-in for gypsies) gives the party a fortune telling that hints where certain items or allies may be located. The module suggests giving out levels when the party retrieves those items or accomplishes some goal related to the fortune telling. Individual XP is not tallied.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I did not like this method for several reasons. One, it pushes D&amp;D into the mold of heroic fantasy, a place where the game is at its weakest; two, it removes the granularity from leveling and forces synchronized leveling; and three, it undermines player agency by pressing upon them a single method of advancement that discourages the players from meaningfully engaging with the setting.<br/><br/>One can argue that gold-for-XP likewise discourages the players from engaging with the setting, and I would agree, but that is only because the game is focused on playing adventurers seeking their fortune. In the case of milestone leveling, the characters are theoretically given greater leeway, but the reward is externalized to the DM's whims. Complete this quest, gain a level. Follow my plot or you won't get the prize! Contrast with gold-for-XP, where the treasure pre-exists in the game world / module and the players are given the opportunity to acquire it. This shift to "milestone XP" likewise accompanies a shift in DMing style from judge / referee / impartial arbiter of the rules toward a storyteller in the vein of heroic fantasy.<br/><br/>As I said, I don't feel that this style of gameplay is suited for D&amp;D, due in part to character mortality and the strong emphasis on miniatures combat.<br/><br/>This is perhaps a distinction that is mostly academic (hairsplitting is a hobby of mine) but I believe it matters.\n<blockquote>Random procedural generation, heck yeah.

I am drawing a blank on exactly what those do, and on the best ways to use them. (It's a "run away" check, right?) Please enlighten me!<br/></blockquote>\nMorale tests are from D&amp;D's wargaming roots, an optional rule in B/X, and they are called for under certain circumstances. When, for instance, the NPCs suffer a casualty, or they suffer 50% casualties, they must test morale or surrender/flee.

It felt off to me, something didn't click.<br/><br/>It seems to me that what you and ValyrianSteelKatana are talking about is similar this, with XP for achieving millestones etc. That could have partially worked to foster more "drama-driven" gameplay, but as ValyrianSteelKatana also mentioned, it fosters railroading, and the deadliness associated with D&amp;D and character turnover doesn't really click with such character-driven play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463062/#Comment_463062" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T01:03:42+00:00" title="May  7, 2017  1:03AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>have you read "Simple World"?

What are the rules for what you can do to take advantage of that, or how you might suffer from it?<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever played an RPG where lighting was a relevant rules quantity.  In my experience, it's always been: either you can see the thing you want to see, or you can't, as established by rules-independent fictional particulars, such as how close the GM arbitrarily decided your enemies were when they decided to start chanting spells or shooting arrows or whatever.<br/><br/>Honestly, most of my groups have discovered that there wasn't much fun to do in play when you couldn't see, so we did a lot of handwaving.  Our main lighting concern was "Who's carrying torches right now?" so that character couldn't use two-handed weapons, and the party might be in darkness if that/those character(s) were felled.  Hours of torchlight weren't tracked either, on the theory that torches are cheap and when one burns down you just light another.  It was fun for novice adventurers to figure this out for the first time, but worrying about it after that didn't seem rewarding.<br/><br/>I did hear about one session my friends played which was <i>all about being unable to see</i> -- PCs trying to find each other in the woods without getting lost or accidentally attacking each other -- but I've never heard anything similar come out of a dungeon crawl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463096/#Comment_463096" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T19:43:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2017  7:43PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Btw the 4e removal of "dim light", just having bright and then pitch black, was RAI for that edition.

That's gonna be a strong feelbad moment. It's easy to want to shelter ourselves from it. I've succumbed to time rewinds and what not. But over time, I've learned that for the particular people I play with, and YMMV, what really matters is not what they say just as the hammer is falling, but what they answer when I, after time has passed, ask them with all seriousness whether or not it's time to switch over to a game where you can't die. And then it's up to them if they want to take me up on that or if they want to back into the fire for some more servings of that delicious bleed and agony.<br/><br/>Do you go to the dungeon to find out how to make peace with your days in the dungeon?

The GM tells you "the corridor continues for a distance, disappearing in the darkness." He has just utilized the illumination rules, determining that 40, 60 or however many feet is enough that the paltry light you have does not allow you to determine what lurks at the end of the corridor.<br/><br/>You open a door into a room. The GM tells you "the back wall seems to be about 20 feet out, while the right-hand wall is a mere couple feet away - the door is at the front-right corner of the room. The facing fall must be somewhere in the darkness to your left, at least 50 feet away; you can see three great pillars supporting the ceiling, at regular distances from each other." When you decide to move into the room and explore further, the GM expands upon the description, telling you what you did not see from the doorway.<br/><br/>You see something at the very edge of where you light carries: "There is a dark shape out there, and it is moving. Might be humanoid, but could as well be the front half of a manticore." You move curiously closer, getting to the "dim" zone: "The movement proves to be three large, silent humanoid shapes. They carry arms of some sort." As you approach, perhaps speaking diplomatically, you come to the "bright" distance: "The three are hobgoblins, muscular and savage, with Red Scorpion clan markings. They do not seem alarmed at seeing you, but they do have swords in hand, and their eyes are alert."<br/><br/>Do those examples clarify anything at all? In all cases the GM references the position of the PC adventurer against the positioning of everything else before he describes what the PC sees. To gather additional information the PC needs to move about, compensating for the limited amount of light by going closer to things.<br/><br/>I haven't generally found that I'd need anything more than some lightning distance abstractions/conventions, plus precise dungeon maps, to achieve the effect where a PCs subjective viewpoint and lightning condition becomes a tactical issue. You need to pay attention to distances and lightning constantly, though, or this aspect of the "simulation" soon gets laid to wayside.<br/><br/>A secondary, bonus effect for illumination: the more light you have, the easier it is to notice traps and secrets. Apply condition modifiers liberally, you're unlikely to over-emphasize how very important the amount of unobstructed, even light is for noticing e.g. the blackened string trigger of a rockfall trap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463101/#Comment_463101" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T20:24:25+00:00" title="May  7, 2017  8:24PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2017 8:32PM by Peter_Perry.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David Berg,<br/><br/>my experience is that people just wing it (me included) when it comes to exactly what the light radius or light cone (if appropriate) is from a torch/lamp/whatever. I don't find that the trouble to track that kind of thing pays off. It's easier to just go with what feels right in the fiction. Tracking how many torches you have, how long they last (although you don't need to be too precise here), and who's carrying what is more important. It leads to satisfying planning for expeditions and also though decisions during exploration. I dislike the "infinite &amp; weightless torches" method. I'm curious to know how you guys play it.<br/><br/>PS: Eero answered in the meanwhile. Personally, I just get a feel for the situation. If it's a long corridor, you should get a feel if the torch illuminates to the end or not and up to where. If it's a big room, you get the feel if the torch illuminates the near walls and/or the ceiling and/or the closest columns, etc. I'm not very precise with it, but it works well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463107/#Comment_463107" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T23:06:17+00:00" title="May  7, 2017 11:06PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I definitely enjoy that aspect of play in dungeons and other dangerous, unknown environments!<br/><br/>Personally, though, when I'm asked, "How big is the room?" I answer, "Big enough that you need to move into it to see what's against the far wall."  That's all the info we need.  All these measurements in feet or meters or whatever are completely unnecessary for me.  In fact, the mental effort of translating back and forth between (a) factual spatial quantity and (b) relevance to decision considerations -- I've seen and experienced that as a major drag.<br/><br/>So, getting back to VSKatana's original point and my original question about it:  In a game where the rules are few but important, with some of the main ones controlling advancement and death, "Let's all agree on how many feet torch light carries," doesn't make it into that class for me.  So I'm wondering if they had something else in mind.  "Light = 30ft" isn't really even a rule in my eyes, it's a mere description of the fiction we're already trying to model without rules.  (It's not even the best tool for that purpose, at least not if you have a table full of players who understand the nuances of reflectivity and position w.r.t. light source.  Bad news, adventurers: any of you who are standing <i>behind</i> a person with a torch, your effective forward illumination in an open space is <i>zero</i> feet, not thirty.  In an enclosed space, different story, but still an issue.)<br/><br/>Anyway, if we're playing using a system that tracks its other important quantities in feet, then maybe "light = 30ft" interacts with that in some interesting ways.  But I didn't see anything about archery or flanking or backstabs or charging or whatnot in your examples, Eero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463108/#Comment_463108" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-07T23:12:44+00:00" title="May  7, 2017 11:12PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2017 11:19PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Tracking how many torches you have, how long they last (although you don't need to be too precise here), and who's carrying what is more important.

But then they inevitably come up with an optimal solution, and that becomes rote and not worth further attention.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is some actual reason why a small band of humanoids can't bring all the light sources they need on an underground excursion, but if so, I've yet to put my finger on it.  I suppose it makes sense on particularly long crawls with zero light provided?  I don't tend to run many of those.  Even in that case, though, isn't it just a matter of calculating before you enter the dungeon, "We have to turn around after 3 hours," and then doing that?  I'm fine with that reality being present in the fiction -- if it's what makes sense, then it's what I'd want! -- but it doesn't constitute a major factor in my play experience.  Just bookkeeping, on the same order as tracking rations.<br/><br/>A rule that says, "Hey, don't forget that you don't have infinite light; figure out how long you can stay in the dungeon before running out!" would cover it for me.  Maybe that's exactly what the OSR has, just phrased differently via some calculus of torch-carrying (encumbrance?), torch light duration, and time length of adventuring activities (covering distance, fighting and looting)?  If so, my rule sounds easier.  <img alt=":tongue:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":tongue:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Technically speaking, if everybody had their own torch, the party would probably have just about enough light to get by; usually this is not the case, and therefore the potential for various difficulties exists.<br/><br/>I do not quite know why the adventurers have not optimized the lightning issue to such a degree that it would have become rote; it may be because the circumstantial difficulties caused by lightning conditions are not formalized into a clear rules text treatment, which in turn means that the players do not quite realize how much difficulty they are causing themselves by not investing in sufficient light. Like, they don't realize that their character being uncomfortably close to the giant spider when it is spotted is not caused only by their dicing luck in the spot check, but also by the amount of light they chose to go into that room with.<br/><br/>Light spells are valuable because the light is much, much stronger than what the adventurers are usually working with. Like, bonuses all around for noticing stuff, and no bullshit about having to move closer to see something clearly, or having to have your torch-bearer next to you all the time. Essentially, if a torch is "the GM is constantly making my life difficult" and a lantern is "well, this actually works pretty well", then the light spells are "yeah, this is a fantasy game, we don't sweat lightning conditions".<br/><br/>As for my motivation in caring about this stuff, it's merely hygienic - the decision to simply look at the fiction and model its difficulties was already made at the starting gates of the game's process, and there has not since then been any sort of "GM considers which aspects of the fiction to ignore from now" phase in play, so I continue running the proceedings according to original specification (a robust, fluidly playing yet generally realistic tactical operations environment). The only way I would decide to stop simulating lightning conditions would be if I decided that it is out of scope for the simulation - that is, it's too unimportant to care about. This has not been the case so far, and actual practice in doing the simulation seems to make it easier, so there's less motivation for dropping it as time goes by.<br/><br/>Regarding real measures for room dimensions and such, I've actually found that they make things easier over the long term. When you've got some intuitive standards for how light and sound and such behave in different spaces, you can just look at the grid map and make quick and objective snap judgements about tactical stuff. For me it's well worth it to quantify light and such in real terms instead of using relative measurements like "the room is so large you cannot see the other end from the door" as the primary geometry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463127/#Comment_463127" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T04:43:00+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  4:43AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I get your idea. Some GMs create the world first and then leave it up to rules and sim to generate the experience (like Eero) while others create the experiences and let them define the world that exists around them. I love this trick, for it saves time, it requires no prep, and allows the GM to focus on other content in the fiction. <br/><br/>However starting with the effects and ignoring the causes changes the CA of the whole game. OSR CA is more about simulating real challenge, while this is more about simulating an optimal experience of the fictional world. While in play they look similar, the frame of mind makes them quite different experiences.<br/><br/>Knowing that the world is "real", has precise measures that it's been there before we started playing, introduces a different set of emotions for both the GM and the players. Not knowing what's going to happen or appear until it comes to the PC's "narrative" sensorial range introduces a completely different set of emotions. Both ways are perfectly valid gameplay styles, but there's no sense nor benefit in judging one from the techniques, results, problems and advantages of the other.<br/><br/>Does it make sense?

I answer, "Big enough that you need to move into it to see what's against the far wall."  That's all the info we need.  All these measurements in feet or meters or whatever are completely unnecessary for me.  In fact, the mental effort of translating back and forth between (a) factual spatial quantity and (b) relevance to decision considerations -- I've seen and experienced that as a major drag.<br/><br/>So, getting back to VSKatana's original point and my original question about it:  In a game where the rules are few but important, with some of the main ones controlling advancement and death, "Let's all agree on how many feet torch light carries," doesn't make it into that class for me.  So I'm wondering if they had something else in mind.  "Light = 30ft" isn't really even a rule in my eyes, it's a mere description of the fiction we're already trying to model without rules.  (It's not even the best tool for that purpose, at least not if you have a table full of players who understand the nuances of reflectivity and position w.r.t. light source.  Bad news, adventurers: any of you who are standing <i>behind</i> a person with a torch, your effective forward illumination in an open space is <i>zero</i> feet, not thirty.  In an enclosed space, different story, but still an issue.)<br/><br/>Anyway, if we're playing using a system that tracks its other important quantities in feet, then maybe "light = 30ft" interacts with that in some interesting ways.  But I didn't see anything about archery or flanking or backstabs or charging or whatnot in your examples, Eero.</p></div></blockquote>\nRoom sizes may or may not be important during gameplay, depending on what the group emphasises. For example, careful mapping during dungeon exploration allows you to predict where hidden rooms/locations are and if you missed some hidden door etc, so exact sizes are important for some groups. But not everyone does this. Because it has been many years since I've run anything D&amp;D I don't know what I'd do today.<br/><br/>As for lighting, in my experience everyone winged it and just went for a common sense/what-feels-right approach. But apparently Sandra and Eero do pay significant attention to it. I think that's very satisfactory, as far as someone else is GMing, not me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463153/#Comment_463153" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T16:36:17+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  4:36PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2017 4:41PM by Peter_Perry.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Oh, I love the first time the adventurers come across this issue and have to plan!

I suppose it makes sense on particularly long crawls with zero light provided?  I don't tend to run many of those.  Even in that case, though, isn't it just a matter of calculating before you enter the dungeon, "We have to turn around after 3 hours," and then doing that?  I'm fine with that reality being present in the fiction -- if it's what makes sense, then it's what I'd want! -- but it doesn't constitute a major factor in my play experience.  Just bookkeeping, on the same order as tracking rations.<br/><br/>A rule that says, "Hey, don't forget that you don't have infinite light; figure out how long you can stay in the dungeon before running out!" would cover it for me.  Maybe that's exactly what the OSR has, just phrased differently via some calculus of torch-carrying (encumbrance?), torch light duration, and time length of adventuring activities (covering distance, fighting and looting)?  If so, my rule sounds easier.  <img alt=":tongue:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":tongue:"/> </p></div></blockquote>\nFor many dungeons it makes sense. For example Barrowmaze is a megadungeon that consists in a massive series of interconnected tombs. They are for the most part totally dark and silent, meaning that not only is illumination a factor but also noise (and theres a lot of breaking down walls and excavation to do in that dungeon). There are different access points to the surface, so this plays nicely with that factor: the more access points you have the less torches you need. Here's a cool promo vid for Barrowmaze:<br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-3wKQq8gLDXE?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKQq8gLDXE"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/3wKQq8gLDXE/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/>The reason why you can't just "take enough torches" is that you don't know how long you'll have to stay underground. You plan it, but can you make it to the surface in time before the lights go out? What if you can't go back the way you came and have to find some other way to the surface? Plus torches may count for encumbrance. How much depends on the system. Labyrinth Lord gives weights for torches, others don't. You can also use them to attack, and you may loose them that way. So, weight and number may affect gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463154/#Comment_463154" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T17:14:03+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  5:14PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Gotcha, that does ring a bell.
