This makes a <i>lot </i>of games really difficult to enjoy and I want to brainstorm ways of managing them given our constraints. <br/><br/>Given our situation, a few general questions:<br/><br/>1. What games are a perfect fit? (We already play a lot of Fiasco, which was essentially custom made for this group)<br/>2. How can we adapt ourselves or the games to enjoy Apocalypse World, TechNoir, Dresden Files or your favorite game?<br/><br/>If you have a group with similarly awkward or weird parameters, feel free to lay out your situation and ask for ideas here as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338390/#Comment_338390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T07:53:28+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  7:53AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mist-Robed Gate, Fiasco, Geiger Counter, and Microscope were all designed specifically for one-shot short-session GM-less pick-up games with larger numbers of players and are, off the top of my head, about the only games that I can think of like that.  Maybe Montsegur 1244 too.  Microscope also supports multi-session play better than the other two.  I expect we'll keep seeing more games like these.<br/><br/>In my experience, two hours is fine for Apocalypse World if it's a continuing session, though it doesn't give you much time to play after the initial setup, if you're just starting out.  It'll stretch out the pacing of the campaign, but that's cool.  If you have more than 4 players, I might split into two sub-groups, though, or try to get someone to help co-MC the thing.  At five and six players, AW (or any game really) slows down a lot.<br/><br/>If you already have characters, you can do Mouse Guard in two hours too, especially if you hew closely to the explicit guidelines about having a few challenges/fights and then shifting immediately to the player turn.  Historically, I've been more drift-y with it and run it more open, but it's stated way to play is dense and fast. Having more characters in Mouse Guard is slightly easier because the way the fight rules group PC actions together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338391/#Comment_338391" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T07:57:55+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  7:57AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Basic D&amp;D</i> with a whole lot of 5 Room Dungeons and a sandbox approach.

Finally, I said that we would always have Mouse Guard as a fall back and it has since taken over. <br/><br/>Advantages - Codified Gm/Player turn helps things move along. Being patrol/mission based means that you can quickly come up with a self contained scenario to engage the players that showed up. Beliefs/Instincts/Goals create meaningful play for the characters.<br/><br/>You can also lift a lot of these hard-wired things and use them in other games (I'm pretty much sold on the mission for short sessions)<br/><br/>Disadvantages - It really helps if everyone makes characters together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338456/#Comment_338456" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T13:10:00+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  1:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of very short Basic D&amp;D (or other stripped down dungeon crawl game) dungeons.

Progress the "metaplot" storyline only as much as these immediate situations allow. Allow a single situation &amp; its fallout to comprise the whole session.

The 'issue' you face can be thought of as having two failure points: serialized plots and inconsistent cast. You can't fix the latter, so work on the former. Just about any game can be paced to episodic play (though some don't 'shine' as much that way). Supers, in particular, but 'crawl of the week' (as mentioned above) also works. Fight the urge to play epics and focus on mission-style play.<br/><br/>I also suggest trying to make it three hours, if possible. Two strikes me as too little to warm up, get into rythem, and have even one solid peak moment.<br/><br/>On more practical matters, cut systems ruthlessly, say yes, play the hub not the spokes, etc. Try simultaneous actions, and trust players to be legit (I'm thinking of D&amp;D, now, and similar turn-based resolution games), only going back to turns as a conclusion nears (e.g., the killing blow).<br/><br/>Also, if you end up stuck in the middle, and next session someone doesn't show, just 'ghost' them: run them on autopilot. Works best if the players all provide 'scripts' of a sort for when they aren't there (like a long list of BW Instincts).<br/><br/>I won't bother naming a slew of games that have short play times; you know them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338631/#Comment_338631" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-13T16:24:36+00:00" title="August 13, 2011  4:24PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another idea: run three games.

I've been running it recently and it's been a different group of players each time we play. Sometimes when we run out of time in the middle of a chapter we continue with the same cast of characters next time, and I'll simply take on some of the PC characters as NPCS or vice versa. If we are starting a new chapter, it's very simple to to consult the oracle as normal and draw up a new set of characters, letting any returning players who showed up bring in old characters from the owe list. I feel like any game where players can switch off playing different characters will work as well.<br/><br/>Another idea I have for you, which is something I've been thinking about trying myself anyways, is hacking a game like Fiasco for long form campaign play, Take the survivors from the last game and look at what trouble they are getting into a year after their last fiasco?

I'm not coming up with any brilliant ideas on how differently to prep for the game, but the structure of fronts and threats makes it so that you can adapt well at the table and MC love letters helps cover those who missed a couple weeks or whatever.  I'd consider limiting each person to one PC in a given play session to keep focus tighter, but that might not be needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338912/#Comment_338912" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T12:47:38+00:00" title="August 15, 2011 12:47PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everybody for the suggestions and thoughts.
