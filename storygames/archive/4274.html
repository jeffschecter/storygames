The most important clue is the one that tells them where to look next (i.e. gets them to the next scene.)  At the end of an adventure, the characters get experience based on how much of the puzzle they figured out, so all the other clues they may have missed definitely have an impact.<br/><br/>Another approach that has occurred to me from my own experience trying and failing to GM investigation plots is to simply tell the players what questions they are trying to answer and attach experience to answering them.  As each question gets answered, it may reveal more questions and so on.  I came up with this after realizing that most of the time the players didn't even know which questions to ask.<br/><br/>On the third item, it seems like it will often be a combination of what happened, who made it happen, and why did they want it to happen.  The first two probably fall under the second item on your list.  Figuring out why someone wanted something to happen may shift the focus from physical investigation to more people/NPC focused play.  Like interviews.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
