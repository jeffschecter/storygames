                    So, I've got my playtest kit out there - the introductory demo.  And a few different groups (three, thus far) have played through it.  They liked it fine, but that's not what I'm interested in with this thread.<br/>
<br/>
The groups all reported back stuff that translates as "my players bought in only partly, and then came apart at the end of the game".  Asking a couple of the testers about this, many of them noted that since there was no indication of a way to take play anywhere further at this point, the players only 'bought into' the game to a certain degree.<br/>
<br/>
I saw much the same thing with my demo of Dogs over the weekend.  People got it, they bought in most of the way, and then a few of them came back out slowly as they realized the night was ending up, and there were no copies of the book left for them to get.<br/>
<br/>
I begin to suspect that there's some level of 'critical mass' in terms of game material / continued group play where buy-in becomes more likely.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have experiences related to this, or thoughts on it to share?                </div>
