One thing that struck me is how sorcery is represented: whether it's priests, druids, abbots, mad hermits, fasting against an enemy, etc., the prayers and sorcery all have a powerful intimidating effect, sometimes enough to dissuade an enemy from attacking.  Sorcery (as depicted) is basically a sort of dogma- and bile-fueled intimidation or oratory skill. This strikes me as pretty neat, and very flavourful.<br/><br/>Now, that's all very well and good when the sorcerers are on the players' side, intimidating NPCs.  But when it's the other way around, it strikes me that this sort of thing would fall dead flat.  Who would feel good about running away from an angry druid knowing full well that it's only your character's superstition to blame?<br/><br/>I'm coming from BW, where failed bravery or social tests often bind characters to behavior the player might not normally choose.  Do you think you could 'get into it', and eventually sorcerers would be genuinely feared because of their mechanical effect?  (In much the same way that someone with a high Intimidate score is?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309180/#Comment_309180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T22:17:14+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 10:17PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I absolutely think I could go for it. Dramatic irony is pretty awesome. <br/><br/>Have you played Dogs in the Vineyard? That's not the most directly-relevant example, but in it, the GM is advised not to tell the players whether or not demons are real. <br/><br/>Since players like me are used to not having 100% narrative certainty in their input, when we're told "Nah, guys, it's up to you if demons are real", then we have to stop and think - Are they? Do we want them to be? Or not? Why not?<br/><br/>This sounds like an interesting opportunity in exploring pre-modern, non/anti-scientific paradigms from "within" them - that is, aping or imitating them for the purpose of exploring the What If? lurking in there. Blacksmiths have magic powers, according to Roman-era Brits (and British-Occupation-era Romans, too!) - - so sayeth Terry Jones in his book <i>Barbarians</i>. <br/><br/>I have a question for you: how might one present such a distinction in the text? <br/>And is there any kind of sorcery that isn't basically intimidation? If so, is its efficacy much, much lower since it's psychosomatic or something? <br/><br/>Also - such play could become "haha, people from olden times were stupid!"<br/>If you design such a game, it'd be awesome to include how clever, insightful, and creative olden-timey people were, too.

Do you have reason to fear it? It may be a real pistol. It may be a fake made out of plastic. Or, you may have heard of these pistol things, but never really believed in them.<br/><br/>Whether the pistol can hurt you depends on whether it is real or not. Whether you respect its ability to hurt you depends on your belief in that pistol.<br/><br/>Here is a completely diffferent scenario:<br/><br/>A man points a pointed bone with mysterious glyphs at you. Do you have reason to fear it? Does magic exist? Is the "magic bone" a fake? Is the magician pointing it at you a fake? Could your own belief in the power of that bone actually kill you? You can find some real world examples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdaitchal" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>Belief is a very powerful thing. In less industrial times, magic would have been feared and respected, despite whether it was real or not. It wouldn't be a matter of whether that particular culture was "stupid," but whether one was brought up believing in the power of magic.. Rather how nowadays we are brought up believing in the power of technology.. guns in particular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309284/#Comment_309284" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T05:12:39+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  5:12AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the superstition is backed up by a mechanical advantage, then the characters are affected. So yeah, even if the /player/ doesn't believe, his /character/ may. If you want them to actually have a chance to resist the effect, save with Willpower and such. If they don't like it, point out that they can too use a sorcerer or ten to even the chances. The magic works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if someone can use mechanical benefits against them, and these are strong enough to tilt the balance against the players, there are strong chances they won't mess around with that someone. And that's what it's all about, isn't it ? The sorcerer casting fear in players and characters' heart alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nA french game called Avant Charlemagne dealt with that kind of magic. It was pretty well done. You could use incantations for small, direct effects, potions for long lasting effects, etc. The spell list seems on par with fantasy game lamda until you read them again with a more modern eye and notice that all the effects could be explained away with technical skills (exploding potions, create fire), con job ("I swear to you he turned her into a newt!") and primitive pharmacopeia (healing potions, poisoning blades...). Fitting since it was a historical game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTangent : the more I read about it, the more sorcery seems like the advertisers of that time. A well crafted image, with some powerful iconic elevements, backed up with some heavy slogans and earworms can - and do - change people minds and make them do what they wouldn't have considered alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309293/#Comment_309293" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T06:26:31+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  6:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add that no holy or mystical man worth his salt is going to yell Boo! while taking the chance the person on the other end isn't going to get scared.

What if the curses are real? Who needs mechanics to determine the effects, the effects of magic may be powerful specifically because they are not 'reasonable' but rather twist people, and the story in the RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Pointing the stick" (I may have the term wrong) is outlawed in modern-day Australia because of the vast number of corpses that turned up. No scientist worth his salt thinks that pointing a stick at someone kills them, but the social consequences are tatamount to murder and thus is outlawed. This is a reasonable approach to dealing with a social problem. This is magic at its most basic level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you either need to leave it ambiguous and leave out direct mechanical effect but add story that supports the magical power or you need to add some mechanical effects (at the very least, a willpower roll or equivalent to resist the 'effects'). Perhaps you could have passions (from true love to vengeance at any cost) or personal practices (prayers, spells or lucky items) that 'protect' the individual, giving him a modicum or added immunity to the magic of others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309404/#Comment_309404" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T18:07:49+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  6:07PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're going to have a setting in which there are believers and non-believers, you're going to need to establish how believers feel about non-believers. <br><br>Then, beyond that, we get to thinking about whether believers knew about non-believers before the story began, or some event in it. I'm thinking of Aztecs mistaking Cortez for Quetzalcoatl, in particular. <br><br>Or you have stable groups that have been around each other quite a bit - "contact" happened a while ago. Like Romans and Britons in occupied Londinium, for example. <br><br>Depending on the nature of these groups, how they interact, and when contact occurred/occurs, that could determine whether any of the player-characters actually have to worry about the Belief mechanics. <br>Paul, like you mentioned, some legionaries might get word that there's a blood feud going on in the city over an alleged infertility curse laid by one woman upon another. The Belief mechanics might not come up at all in the course of the story, but that theme informs the starting situation.
