I had a blast. I'm exhausted and worn out, but it was all worth it.<br/><br/>I had a bit of gamer culture shock. I mean, my regular connection to the gaming community at large is forums like this, RPGNet, and a handful of blogs. And maybe it's just my personal tastes, but it seems that games like Spirit of the Century take up as much virtual shelf-space (if not more) in the collective consciousness of the intarwebs as games like CthulhuTech. But when everything is laid out in the exhibit hall, you really get a different perspective of what's what. <br/><br/>Not that I'm surprised. And not that Gen Con is necessarily an accurate reflection of gamer interests either.  <br/><br/>To some people I'm sure that the booths on the indie road map looked a little sad, what with the lack of painted miniatures and LCD screens. They weren't. I had the best times of the con there. Darcy Burgess pulled my friend and I into an awesome demo of <i>Black Cadillacs</i> at the Forge booth which we played with Willow. (I wanted to try Willow's <i>Escape from Tentacle City</i> as well, but wasn't able to get back to the booth at a time when she was there.) I learned about <i>Mist Robed Gate</i> at the Pirate Jenny booth. I was already intrigued by the cover, but now I'm very interested in the game itself. I met lots of people at the IPR booth whose names are on some of my favorite games and where I got to run demos of my own game, <i>Chronica Feudalis</i>. Brennan, Matt, and the other volunteers at the IPR booth really made me feel like my book was in good hands.<br/><br/>I got Bill White to teach me to pronounce <i>Gakanagok</i>, Paul Czege personally explained to me the origin of the Chalk Outlines Principle, Gregor Hutton edified me on the rule of four.<br/><br/>Everyone is so damn friendly. And there's really no perceptible difference in attitude between the story-game designer with her ashcan and the lead line developer with his $50 hardcover, full-color tome. They both just want to tell you about their game. And I had a cool moment when Ross Watson, the lead developer of Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader, was telling me about the buzz he heard about <i>my</i> game.<br/><br/>There are a couple of though-experiments that keep going around in my head: First, what would the landscape of Gen Con look like if it accurately represented the interests of a site like RPGNet? Second, what would happen if you took the dirtiest, hippiest story-game and produced it like it was a high-end mainstream RPG \u2014 huge art budget, all color, hard covers, shiny?  <br/><br/>I was really pleased to meet those of you I met and sorry to miss those of you I missed. Scott Acker, sorry we didn't get a chance to actually talk with the way our schedules overlapped. Next time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225089/#Comment_225089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T10:02:02+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 10:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>what would happen if you took the dirtiest, hippiest story-game and produced it like it was a high-end mainstream RPG \u2014 huge art budget, all color, hard covers, shiny?</blockquote>\nI think we'll find out whenever Daniel releases Do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225095/#Comment_225095" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T10:07:56+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 10:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, say, Mouse Guard? <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225098/#Comment_225098" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T10:09:25+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 10:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite><br/>I was really pleased to meet those of you I met and sorry to miss those of you I missed.

The dude running the register said, "Can I ring that up for you, sir?" The guy goes, "Yeah," and pulls out his wallet, and his buddy stands up and says, "Me too." And I thought, <i>Wow.
