written an awful lot. I don't think that needed to be in the book. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also get asked questions by people that have answers in the book, but they can't grock onto the answer for the same reason that some people can't follow instructions on how to set up the clock on their VCR -- something just isn't translating. (Sometimes clearer writing may have helped that, but many times not. Given any statement in text someone will be unable to comprehend it. Hell, people can't find books at the library, and its all indexed.) This is much the same as John's answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are lots of questions the correct answer to which is "that is up to you and your group." Which may or may not be in the book. (And no, I'm not talking about rule zero. I'm thinking of things like folks asking Clinton where TSOY resolution is supposed to fall on the IIEE scale.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are questions that are just crack. But I'll assume we're talking about good questions here, worth while questions and not ones like the one I got in my mailbox this morning. (About why I'm a communist fag, did my parents beat me?) <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, books and games should be as complete as possible. Its a good thing to shoot for, a noble thing to shoot for. I've yet to see it happen in full and perfect form. So as a platonic ideal, sure. As actual reality, less so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65367/#Comment_65367" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T17:40:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  5:40PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand that there are rules that are just rude or personal or are due to your game bumping up against someone's RPG expectations and them needing a little push to get over that.<br/><br/>Understood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65372/#Comment_65372" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T18:19:36+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  6:19PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>When someone asks a question about your game (e-mail, forum, whatever), shouldn't the only answer the game designer has to give is the relevant page number that the gamer missed?</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, given that rules are written by humans, I think it's impossible to address every single potential question that another human might possibly have on the same material.

If you have the instructions handy, there's some text on page 1 with a couple graphics to help you out.  Say, what are you opening a can of anyway?"<br/><br/>Sure, with a question like that, as has been mentioned before, a page number works.  Note that even if you don't think you can add something, you can still engage the person who bothered to email you, thus (possibly) creating a more invested fan out of them.  This is why I pimp out Atomic Sock Monkey &amp; Evil Hat as much as I do.<br/><br/>"Hey, Judd, I have your can opener, and I'm thinking about using it to hammer in some nails.  Any thoughts?"<br/>"Hi, Ryan!  Wow, that's a neat idea!  Well, I have a couple bits on page 2 about this, but here's some stuff that didn't make it into the book.  I put it up on my Can Opener RPG Wiki [insert URL], but in short, bangs man!  Bangs!  I hope to hear how your hammering turns out!"<br/><br/>So, maybe this is one of those cases where you can't cite a page number, but you can make an effort to encourage and support this outside thinking.  And then you can turn whatever you tell one guy into a public support document, like an FAQ or wiki or whatever.  But, if there is a page they can at all reference, yeah, you want to be sure to put that in.<br/><br/>"Hey, Judd, having a lot of fun with your can opener.  My wife's been complaining a lot lately about our love life; got any ideas for how I could use your can opener for that?"<br/>"Hi, Ryan!  You know, that never occurred to me!  But there might be some folks on CanOpener.net that have tried, so you might want to ask there."<br/><br/>Okay, I was just having fun with this one.  But what I'm trying to illustrate is that even when there's times that all you feel you can give is a page reference, you can add a bit more; conversely, some really off-the-wall ideas likely have some text that can be referred to in order to help make the idea work in the game, and citing those (either as "check this out" or "you'll probably want to ignore this bit") will help the reader more than just a reply without text references.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65403/#Comment_65403" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T04:10:53+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  4:10AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A book is a machine for teaching you the game.<br/><br/>Let's look at some other machines.

WTF?"<br/><br/>In the rules I don't have a paragraph explaining why this is an effective way to kick-start conflict at the beginning of the game.  It's an emergent property of the game - if you follow the instructions, it's quite effective.  So this is a question coming from someone who is reading but not (yet) playing - and that's cool.

Every game has a lot of features that only become apparent through play, so that's an area where citing chapter and verse is going to be problematic.

I'm so glad for this thread!  It got me thinking about why I disagreed with Judd, and the answer I came up with is going to really have an effect on how I write my games.<br/><br/>The difference between a board game manual or a can opener manual and an RPG manual is that the former examples are strictly informative while the latter is both informative and evocative.  A good RPG manual not only explains to the reader how to play the game but also opens up the reader's mind to new possiblities.  Those new possibilities will often manifest as questions, which is a very good thing.<br/><br/>To put it another way, playing an RPG is a creative endeavour.  Opening tin cans, repairing automobiles, and playing monopoly are not.  It is impossible to answer every question about how to go about being creative.<br/><br/>-Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65417/#Comment_65417" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T06:35:59+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  6:35AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>That's an interesting point, and I have to say that I agree that you don't <b>need</b> to include stuff like that in the text.  Because the book is there to teach you to play the game, and just because you don't understand <i>why</i> the rules are like they are, doesn't mean you can't play.  Last time I looked, my copy of Risk didn't say "getting control of Australasia is totally sweet, because you can defend it really easily buy dumping loads of troops on Indonesia or Siam!"<br/><br/>Roach doesn't fall down because there's no explanation of the relationships.  But would it hurt if it was there?<br/><br/>There will alway be people who ask unreasonable question though.

Not desirable, certainly, but they can happen.  You can errata, update and go forwards.<br/><br/>More grey are areas of interpretation.  No matter how clearly a rule is written, as the player base gets larger, there will be _someone_ who reads it differently than intended.  Perhaps their frame of reference is very different, perhaps it is a difference in fluency, perhaps one or both parties have an assumption that causes a conflict, perhaps the level of knowledge has some discrepancies.  These will exist and, I'll go further and say they _must_ exist.  It's a necessary function of complexity and communication.  Certainly when one of these questions comes up because the reader did not actually read the text, or the author did not provide the context, it's frustrating, but often these questions come out of a genuine  understanding of the text.  In fact, these are the questions I like best, because they are often one ones which lie at the heart of fruitful conversation.<br/><br/>Hypothetical will also throw things out of whack. Spirit of the Century has no rules for running a Star Wars game, but the question of how to do so absolutely comes up.  <br/><br/>Now, all that begs the question of whether the purpose of answering the question is to provide the information or to communicate with the person asking.  Ryan explained admirably why questions are opportunities, and I don't think that point _contradicts_ the underlying thought, but I think it highlights the reasons that I think it's a bit more nuanced.<br/><br/>Which is to say, I think it's more like "Pay attention to what kind of questions you get, and which ones can be answered by the text and which ones can't.  It may reveal to you gaps in the text, but it may also reveal to you that there are applications of your game you don't expect.  Whatever they are, pay attention to the questions you are asked. They are one of the clearest windows you will get to how others see your game."<br/><br/>And I think that's a firm agreement in principal, but somewhat less absolutely presented than there being only one kind of answer.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65425/#Comment_65425" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T06:53:17+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  6:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're totally right, Rich, and it's a balancing act between too much information ("here are the seven reasons this is a good rule!")  and not enough (just go play the damn game!

Because the book is there to teach you to play the game, and just because you don't understand<i>why</i>the rules are like they are, doesn't mean you can't play.  Last time I looked, my copy of Risk didn't say "getting control of Australasia is totally sweet, because you can defend it really easily buy dumping loads of troops on Indonesia or Siam!"</blockquote>\nHere's my thing, though, and this is totally subjective, so look out!<br/><br/>We always have to go through a thing when communicating online, realizing that our intentions and thoughts behind our communications might get blurred because we're not there to assist with a glance, body language, or spelling out what we Really Mean with the metaphor we dropped.  With a book, it's probably doubly so. When I see something that looks *weird*, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, but in reality I'll have that nagging doubt that the author just made a mistake.<br/><br/>I remember when we busted out Roach last year at Forge Midwest: Me, Ralph, Julie... James? (I forget).  We went through a breakneck session of the game, and when we got to the "friend on the right, enemy on the left" part, all of us just kind of stopped.  I didn't really recall my last session too clearly (where the rule was used there, I later recalled), and I was like, "Huh... I don't remember that".  A bunch of us thought that maybe the text was simply *mistaken*. Cause misses like that happen: In one book, forget to replace "To the Left" with "Across from you", and the game becomes out of whack.<br/><br/>If that explanation was in the book, like as a sidebar, that totally would have helped us without the pause. I could be like, "Huh, yeah that sounds weird, but here the author says it's intentional and creates some interesting and weird dynamics.  Let's give it a shot!"<br/><br/>Sorcerer, I realized a few years back, has all this "intention" and effects that emerge in play that when you start to notice them over an aggregate amount of time, you're like "Aha, that's interesting how that happened!" But since there's no flags outlining this stuff for you, why it works, revealing the gears and works behind the machine, that's why the Sorcerer forum is half-filled at any given time with people not getting it, and the RPGNet Sales/Auctions forum has at least one or two copies of Sorcerer fresh to sell at any given time.<br/><br/>In Tenra Bansho, the game that I'm translating, in the rules section it has a number of "blackened" sidebars (white text on black) which go "Concept: Life Points" or "Concept: The Flow of Karma" etc.  The author intentionally reveals the thinking behind the placement of gears and cogs, and that makes the game understandable. In fact, if the author didn't do that, I probably never would have "gotten" it, or certainly not gotten over half of it, which still would have been a pain in the ass.  I would have pretty much cast it aside as "pretty, but totally broken crap" instead of "one of my favorite games, ever". As it is, the supplement introduces more "behind the rules" text blurbs, and I'm totally throwing those into the core book, and in fact adding a few more sections. Basically, I don't want to be any advocate to the following flame wars:<br/><br/>A: "We played the game last weekend. The damage rules are totally broken!  I can't understand why no one had noticed this before! We kind of gave up halfway into the second combat, and just played out the rest of the game without the rules."<br/>B: "Dumbass!  You were using the rules right, why did you stop?  The rules are written that way, so that X and Y can happen.  Also, Z, which if you look at Anime, Z happens all the time."<br/>A: "Oh. Well fuck, that was a total waste of about 20 man-hours then. Well, we've moved on anyway, having been soured on the experience. Anyone wanna buy the book?"<br/><br/>GMing is hard enough as it is.  Intentionally introducing a blank area for self-doubt for the GM means that more First Games of your game will fail, or that the GM (or players) won't be as spot on as they could have been.<br/><br/>There's lots of thought on that process (discovering emergent properties of games through play, vs explaining them up front, or a hybrid of telling the reader to 'watch what happens' which indicates that it's intentional and not a mistake). As someone who tends to end up running or playing a lot of these newer games, I'm a fan of clear explanation. I've been pretty soured on a few games because what was in the book didn't make sense when on the Front Lines: The confusion that ensues may in fact destroy a gaming session.<br/><br/>Board games are more focused, there's no confusion, the emergent play stuff tends to come out in the second or third game.  Board games you can lightly invest in, and be finished in an hour or three.  With RPGs, the players tend to be a lot more invested, and the time tends to be around 3-5 hours, so that if that first session fails, it usually fails HARD.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65435/#Comment_65435" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T07:27:07+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  7:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that, Andy.

Speaking as a consumer (little current ambition to write a game), I crave pre-sales information that tells me if a given game is something I can play and enjoy. In other words, folks, please don't put out an ad for your can opener with copy like "Enhances your love life!"

HOWEVER, I think people need to be very careful about the way they go about this. There's a danger to the inclusion of "designer's notes" interwoven throughout the game text, e.g. where the designer says things like "Don't you love this rule, because by using it the players will do X?" Because people may read that and then think they <i>must</i> do X <i>all the time</i>, which then sucks the life out of the mechanics. The players aren't using the mechanics anymore, just aping the declared intention of the designer. Whereas without that text, the players might have done X <i>sometimes</i>, or they might find a way to use the mechanics to sometimes do Y, which is also fun for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65457/#Comment_65457" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T08:30:02+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  8:30AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>I'll single out TonyLB as someone whom I've seen be very upfront about this, to the extent of telling people his game might not be the superhero game they're looking for, and designing his<i>Capes!</i>demo with the explicit purpose of giving people enough of a taste to see if it's their kind of thing.</blockquote>\nIt was heartwarming to see Tony and Michael Miller doing tandem demos for people at Gen Con, really supporting each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65459/#Comment_65459" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T08:41:09+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  8:41AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys,<br/><br/>I'd like to clarify a little why we try to use page references so much when we answer questions. There are actually several reasons. <br/><br/>1. Speaking to what Judd posted above, we try very hard to make the text the go-to authority. When we do our in-house playtests, we're not allowed to ask Luke (or me if I helped work on something) how a rule is supposed to work or how to deal with a situation. We have to find the information in the text (or not, if it's not there) and interpret it. That habit has become standard. When we play and someone starts doing something that doesn't come up all the time (a skill that isn't used frequently or we're in a cave with no light or something else), everyone who's not directly participating in the scene opens their book, finds the relevant information, and is ready to act as a resource for the GM and the players involved in the scene. We want to encourage that behavior in our players as well because the game system was designed around such a distributed load. It simply doesn't work as well when one person tries to assume all the responsibility for the rules.<br/><br/>2. Giving a page reference forces us to go back and read the rule so that we make sure that we're speaking with authority about what the text says rather than what we may have intended it to say or even misremembered it to say. It's always possible that we're dealing with genuine errata and there's no better way to determine it. But it's also surprisingly common to realize that you've subtly started to unintentionally drift the rules in a certain way. That's useful information for a possible revision, but you're only going to confuse fans further if you offer up a drifted answer as definitive.<br/><br/>3. For community-building purposes, it is essential that we help our fans become experienced and even expert users. When we respond with a page reference, we are signaling that our answer is authoritative and based on the rules rather than speculative or subjective. We're also encouraging the fans to look at the text, and not us, as the final authority. In turn, we hope, that helps give our fans confidence to answer the questions of their fellows with a page reference and explanation. Fans that can contribute in that way are much more likely to remain part of the community.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. When I give a page reference, I'm not trying to be a dick. I almost always offer additional commentary and explanation to help the questioner understand how something works and why. I also like to use examples from actual play to help put a rule in context. It's just a simple fact that everyone learns in different ways. Sometimes, something just won't click for someone until we have a conversation about it. Sometimes it will never click.<br/><br/>All that said, I think it's ok and even beneficial to allow a text to create questions that can't be simply answered by careful reading. One of my favorite examples is a kid who came onto the boards a year or two ago. He cited page 48 of the rule book, a short section called <b>Advancement Is Lifeblood</b>. The section talks about how Advancement helps players shape their characters, and so GMs need to offer a range of different Obstacles--from challenges that are easy to overcome to some that are nearly impossible.<br/><br/>The section was simple enough. But this kid asked us, "Ok. How do I actually make Advancement the lifeblood of my game?"<br/><br/>And it touched off a very interesting, and hopefully enlightening, discussion of the system and its philosophical underpinnings. Burning Wheel requires that you stretch your character and occasionally overreach in pursuit of your Beliefs. You have to be willing to tackle the hard things and accept failure when you believe in something. This guy's players were backing off from really challenging situations because they didn't want to fail. But they were also frustrated at their lack of Advancement.<br/><br/>Mechanically, they understood what was required by the game. The question was whether they could accept it. A simple page reference wasn't going to answer this question, but a discussion of the rules, Beliefs, and the roles of GMs and players really helped. <br/><br/>Discussions of advanced topics like this are desirable! You want to be able to answer baseline questions about use with page references and examples. But you also want to encourage fans who have questions about using your ruleset with finesse and expertise to come to your site and join your community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65478/#Comment_65478" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T09:42:29+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  9:42AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Thor: That was really enlightening, especially re the "Advancement is Lifeblood" part.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65598/#Comment_65598" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T17:18:39+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  5:18PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Huh.
