You stick in inside the front cover. The rules are the game are such that as long as you have 3 people with books, you can play. Here is how you play (roughly):<br/><br/>1. Each book represents a soul. Each time you sit down with some people you play out events from one life of the soul. The rules in the front of the book tell you how to do this.<br/><br/>2. Certain events and choices in previous lives of the soul affect their Karma and other scores. These have a mechanical effect on play.<br/><br/>3. When you are done playing. Pass the book to the person on your right. A new soul has been given into your keeping. It will re-incarnate next time you play. Go home. Hug your husband/wife/girlfriend/boyfriend/kids/pets. Have dinner. Go to work the next day. <br/><br/>4. Later, start to read the account in the book of all the lives the soul has passed through til now. You will be playing this soul next time you play, so read well. It's up to you (and fate) to decide whether the soul rises towards nirvana, or falls towards the inferno.<br/><br/>5. Still later, at a convention or a local gathering, you meet some friends (or strangers who you come to trust). You notice that they are carrying "souls" too. Maybe the notebook is displayed prominently in their front pocket. Maybe they are wearing the lotus mark that identifies them as players. Regardless, you all look at each other and say "Let's play..."<br/><br/>6. And so the cycle continues. When the book is almost full, follow the rules and weigh the souls' deeds against their karma. Then, their final fate narrated, send them back to the player who originated the book you hold - a soul worn down by a long journey, but with many stories to tell. Who knows, maybe someday the soul you sent out into the world will return again too...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233624/#Comment_233624" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T08:25:55+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  8:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a problem, too.
