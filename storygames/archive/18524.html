Last year it was just a game day, but it has leveled up like crazy and now it's a super sweet two day mini-con. You will find mostly story games here, with some old school roleplaying games on the side, but this year we are putting a much stronger emphasis on jeepform theater games, and we have the space to really put on some ambitious productions. We are also looking to do a large pervasive game that would involve all of the attendees. Details are still coming in, but there is all kinds of fresh hotness happening here! Below are like, all the details. See you in October!<br/><br/>-Tayler<br/><br/>Technicolor Dreams 2013: <br/>Spontaneous shared stories told together!<br/><br/>October 5th &amp; 6th 2013<br/><br/>Portland Abbey Arts<br/>7600 N Hereford Avenue <br/>Portland, Oregon 97220<br/><br/>Technicolor Dreams is bigger, better and badder than it was last year! Now we have two days for exploring alternative story mediums and creating stories spontaneously through play. Get ready to dive deep, do something new, and blow your mind into a whole new plane of consciousness!<br/><br/>You will find all kinds of non-digital, in-person group games centered around a shared storytelling experience. This includes story games, theater games, pervasive games and even old school roleplaying games. But you don\u2019t need to know a thing about any of it. Each activity is suitable for beginners and newcomers from all walks of life. All you need to do is show up with the willingness to try something new and see where it takes you.<br/><br/>This is what all this awesome is going to cost you. <br/>Sat + Sun\t$15<br/>Sat Only\t        $10<br/>Sun Only\t        $8<br/><br/>You can pay at the door or in advance. Links coming soon!<br/><br/>But, if this would be a burden for you, all you have to do is write to Hans or Tayler at playoutloudpdx@gmail.com and tell us about it. We can go from there.<br/><br/>Along those lines, you are more than welcome to help pay somebody else\u2019s way by chipping in a little extra.<br/><br/>For your convenience, the event is broken up into slots, with breaks for lunch and dinner: <br/><br/>Saturday 10/5<br/>9am - 1pm\t<br/>2pm - 6pm<br/>8pm - 12pm<br/><br/>Sunday 10/6<br/>10am - 2pm\t<br/>3pm - 7pm<br/><br/>When you arrive, there will be sign up sheets for different activities for each slot. Just sign up and you are good to go! There will be no pre-registration for activities.<br/><br/>As details about specific games come in we\u2019ll post about them so you can salivate all the while. Please keep in mind that as things come into focus the details may change just a bit. So stay tuned!<br/><br/>EXPLORE, ENRICH, ENJOY!<br/><br/>A few things to keep in mind as you have the time of your life:<br/><br/>Mind the neighbors. Quiet hours are 10pm - 7am. Just don\u2019t make a ruckus outside and you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>We can have alcohol in this space, but a Portland Abbey Arts staff member has to open it, and they have to charge a small opening fee.<br/><br/>There are kitchens and we can use them! Can anyone say awesome group meals?<br/><br/>You are expected to clean up after yourself everywhere and always. Especially in the kitchen.<br/><br/>People of all experience levels, ethnicities, races, creeds, ages, body types, sexual orientations and gender identities are welcome. We are committed to providing a safe and friendly environment for all participants, and we expect everybody to uphold these values.<br/><br/>We will be accepting donations for next year\u2019s event if you feel so inclined to make such a contribution.<br/><br/>For more information see the Play Out Loud facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/playoutloudpdx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/playoutloudpdx</a>).
