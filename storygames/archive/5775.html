While past weeks have focused on overall themes, this event will focus on reviews based on actual game sessions. Share with us your best and worst experiences with all sorts of games! All it takes is a little time to write it up and including [Actual Play Week] in front of the title when you send it in.<br/><br/>This event will have a prize pool, but it's a different system from our past events. We're restricting the event to just ten winners who may choose as they wish from any donated prizes. Don't let that intimidate you, though, as newcomers and old hands alike have walked away with some wonderful prizes from our past events. For this event we're also restricting the prize pool to RPG reviews, though we would love to see reviews of any non-RPG products you care to submit that week as well.<br/><br/>If you're a publisher and would like to sponsor this event then please PM me here or contact me at cwricheson AT gmail DOT com and I'll add you to our beloved group of supporters.<br/><br/>And whether you participate or not please join us during the week of March 24th for some fantastic reviews!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129328/#Comment_129328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:13:58+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:13PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, this is great, Chris.

Encourage your fans to participate and take a bit of time to review another indie game you've played.  Heck, if every author reviewed another author's game (just 1) it would be an awesome event!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129332/#Comment_129332" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:15:21+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:15PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Oh, this is great, Chris.
