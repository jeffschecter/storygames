The Fish Demons invaded the land, trying to sink everything beneath the waves. But the race of man fought, and cast back the sea back. They were unable to pursue the fish demons into their watery home, however, and instead they were forced to sign a truce. The terms of the truce were that the Fish-Demons would swear not to again invade the land, and would serve humankind instead. But when a thousand demons had served a thousand years, the Demons would be free of their pact, free to attack the surface world again. The humans swore they would never summon the aid of the Demons, that the end of the pact would never come. But humans are weak, and their memory is short.<br/><br/>This session, the scholar managed to decipher the ritual for summoning the demons!<br/><br/>Here's what we know:<br/>- The demons are sworn to serve<br/>- One thousand demons must serve a thousand years before they are free (one million demon-years, in other words)<br/>- No one knows how many years have already been served<br/>- The summoning ritual must take place near water<br/><br/>Give me some cool rules for summoning Fish-Demons! It shouldn't be too dangerous, but maybe not risk-free either. It'd be cool if it didn't let the scholar summon a huge army of demons right away, but it's ok if it does. Bear in mind we're playing heavily strategic D&amp;D, so costs and benefits are ultimately weighed in how they affect future aquisition of XPs (of course, one of the joys of D&amp;D is how even minor things can have strategic importance).<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>BTW: The new combat rules are working great!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378587/#Comment_378587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T22:14:04+00:00" title="May 15, 2012 10:14PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good start would be to have the summoning be accomplished by tossing some specific item into the waves. The item should be rare (and adventurable for) and you can scale the number of fish demons summoned to the quantity or quality of the offering. Let's say for example it's the fossil of some extinct sea creature the fish-demons used to prey on in ages past that, conveniently, lived in a section of the ocean that is now dry land. So more fossils, more complete fossils, would be better offerings for the summoning. The PCs might need to contact a sage to get a lead on where to go fossil hunting, and then you can have PCs scaling cliff faces to chisel the fossils out of them while being pecked at by giant vultures, etc, all that good stuff. The ritual might go awry if the PCs accidentally offend the demons with the wrong fossil.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is just one example that's maybe not super exciting to you. But you could substitute anything else that's [something needed for the ritual somehow] and tie it to place, so the PCs can travel and have adventures to get it, that's something you can leave it in the PC's hands how good a ritual they can achieve, allow for a danger of error, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378590/#Comment_378590" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T23:00:38+00:00" title="May 15, 2012 11:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 12:10PM by johnzo.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it is clich\xe9 these days, but have you considered<br/><b><i><span style="color: #339900;">FISH SEX\u203d</span></i></b>Supply the lusty fish queens with young, healthy, human husbands and once they complete their cavorts they will do you any service within their power!<br/><br/>I guess human sacrifice works too, but yawn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378592/#Comment_378592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T23:28:12+00:00" title="May 15, 2012 11:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Barely a day passes in which I do not consider fish sex.<br/><br/>I think the kind of thing I'm looking for is a cost/benefit or risk/reward tradeoff.

Here's the one that summons demons:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Binding Call<br/>\nYou call a creature to this world from another plane.<br/>\nLevel: Varies<br/>\nComponent Cost: Varies<br/>\nCategory: Binding<br/>\nMarket Price: Varies<br/>\nTime: 1 hour per ritual level<br/>\nKey Skill: Arcana<br/>\nDuration: Permanent<br/>\nYou call the true name of a creature known to you and tear a one-way rift between worlds.  At the end of the ritual, the rift opens and you inexorably draw the creature through.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou use this ritual to call and bind a creature from another plane.  Each specific type of creature requires a different ritual; each ritual has its own level.  The level of the ritual is 4 levels higher than the creature called for a standard monster, the level of the creature for a minion, 6 levels higher for elite, and 10 levels higher for solos.  Market price is standard for that level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the ritual, you must make a check, the DC set by the ritual\u2019s level.  If the check succeeds, you open the rift and pull the creature through.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo rest is allowed during the casting of the ritual.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe creature is free to act upon its own will.  Most sorcerers will prepare a Magic Circle to trap the creature before performing the call.  This allows the sorcerer the time to attempt negotiations with the creature.  The DM makes a Reaction Roll and runs a skill challenge in which the terms of the negotiation are set.  If the skill challenge fails, the creature will not serve the sorcerer.

Having a bunch of nasty demons following you around is going to be hard to explain to people.<br><br>How about this:\n<blockquote><br>To summon a fish demon, you must prise out one of your own teeth, throw it into a body of water, and call out the words of the ancient pact. The demons will come to serve you within the next 24 hours. How many demons come depends on the size and location of the body of water:<br><br/>Wells, Cisterns, sewers: 50% chance of 1 demon<br/>Streams and creeks, or large sewers: 1 demon<br/>Ponds or swamps:  1d4 demons<br/>Lakes, rivers: 1d8 demons<br/>Deep lakes, large underground pools: 2d6 demons<br/>The sea: 2d20 demons<br/>Certain points on the coastline: 2d100 demons<br/><br/>The demons serve for as long as you require them (but they'll dry out and eventually die without daily access to water). The demons want to serve, and want you to summon more demons (so that the ancient truce will end sooner) but they can't supress their demon natures. If they fail a morale roll, there's a 50% chance that they turn on their summoner.<br/></br></br></blockquote>\nSeth, I like your suggestions. A simple way of figuring how long is left on the clock would be cool. A million fish demon years is a lot! Maybe just a small percentage chance each time the summoning is performed that this time the clock has run down? Like, roll d1000 under the number of demons summoned, or something.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378702/#Comment_378702" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T18:31:45+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  6:31PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 6:34PM by Krippler.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just decide how many demon years are left and let the players sweat?

All good points.<br/><br/>Keeping track of how many demon-years the players have used is going to be a bit tricky, but not too bad.
