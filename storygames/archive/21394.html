I'm reposting it here for two reasons:<br/><br/>- former patrons of mine might still hang up here and be interested in reading;<br/><br/>- as a conversation starter, for discussing the impact of Patreon policy changes on story-gamers, and perhaps viable alternatives.\n<blockquote>Dear patrons,<br/><br/>from time to time I get to meet some of you in person, and of course a question you always ask is: is your Patreon page still active? Will you release any more games? \u201cYes, eventually\u201d is my usual answer.<br/><br/>Over the last couple years \u2013 besides working odd-jobs and the general uncertainty about my future \u2013 I\u2019ve been designing and in-house playtesting several role-playing games. However, I haven\u2019t written down much of those (not counting my madman-like scribbled notes) except for an Italian-language Game Chef entry and a larp scenario found in Crescendo Giocoso (both co-authored with Barbara).<br/><br/>As of now, a bunch of juicy new content \u2013 including English-language content \u2013 is actually very close to readable shape. I wouldn\u2019t call any of that a \u201cfinished\u201d game, though, hence it doesn\u2019t qualify as potential paid content under the current wording of my Patreon page. Over the last several months, I\u2019d thought up a plan to restructure the campaign in order for you to get that content at last \u2013 and for me to get a bit of your money. However, as I was almost ready to deploy those changes, Patreon hit us all with big changes of their own that sent me back to the drawing board!<br/><br/>In October, the company suddenly pulled the rug from under the feet of a number of their customers \u2013 content creators depending on Patreon patrons for their income (<a href="http://www.openlettertopatreon.com/" rel="nofollow">here\u2019s the open letter</a> I co-signed with so many others, and links to articles telling the full story). While I\u2019m not one of the creators impacted, the incident made me wary of how Patreon conducts their business (i.e. like most other business entities I know of, sadly) and I chose to bid my time while watching for new developments. This month, they announced a new pricing scheme \u2013 which they\u2019re disingenuously trying to sell us as \u201cmore money to the creators\u201d: as you\u2019ve probably noticed already, everybody is appalled and a lot of people are quitting Patreon altogether.<br/><br/>[Breakdown of boring accounting issues starts here \u2013 feel free to ignore:]<br/><br/>Under the old pricing scheme, I used to get a variable percentage of X (your pledge), minus sunken costs due to currency exchange between EUR and USD and actually moving money from a PayPal account to a real bank account. Under the new scheme, I get a fixed percentage of X (minus all of the above) while you pay X+2.9%+$0.35. While the change from variable to fixed percentage would actually be beneficial to content creators (more predictable income) and the partial shift in who pays Patreon\u2019s cut (creator or patron) would substantially be irrelevant in the long run (although a terrible PR move)\u2026 it\u2019s the fixed +$0.35 per pledge that really hurts. It hurts small pledges so much it changes the big picture completely: you now end up paying $0.49 surcharge to give me $0.95 (a very significant cost), and that\u2019s before VAT, currency exchange rates, etc. for those of us who aren\u2019t based in the USA (while VAT isn\u2019t Patreon\u2019s fault \u2013 and I do believe taxation per se is ultimately beneficial to society \u2013 it feels grossly misplaced when the whole purpose of this model was to establish \u201cpatronage\u201d as something different from a customer-seller relationship). How much sense does it make for someone based in Italy (as I am, as well as about a half of my patrons) to spend close to $2 a month to gift a favorite artist under $1?<br/><br/>[end of boring accounting aside]<br/><br/>Being myself a patron to several creators, and following many more, my mailbox is currently being flooded with their reactions. I\u2019m studying those, looking for emerging trends of response to the new pricing scheme, evaluating what might work for me \u2013 and you. But I\u2019ve also started investigating alternatives to Patreon.<br/><br/>Thus, in the immediate future, I might restructure my existing campaign or I might scrap it all and start anew somewhere else. Either way, you\u2019ll be the first to know.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, should you opt even pull your pledge (which is purely notional at the moment \u2013 you\u2019ll get advance warning before and if I start billing you again) I recommend you keep following me, so I can reach you with news. Alternatively, would you like to stop using Patreon altogether, I suggest you e-mail me at raffaele.manzo@gmail.com and drop a line \u2013 so I can add you to an address list of people I\u2019m to notify of my next move whatever it is.<br/><br/>Lots of love to you all,<br/><br/>Rafu</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468442/#Comment_468442" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-13T18:55:33+00:00" title="December 13, 2017  6:55PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for this breakdown.

My guess is they noticed a much bigger number of users dropping their pledges and/or quitting altogether than they had anticipated, resulting in a loss for them even under the new scheme (as most if not all the creators I support or follow reported losing patrons after the announcements, it's not hard to imagine this was a widespread phenomenon).<br/><br/>However, the wording of their announcement to us creators (clients) strongly implies they're going to make <i>some</i> significant change soon enough - they just need to cook up a new plan. It's apparent something there's "wrong" with their current business model that they need to "fix" to achieve whatever their current objectives are (be it going public, selling to a bigger company or just bringing in new investors).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468549/#Comment_468549" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-20T18:40:19+00:00" title="December 20, 2017  6:40PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, you're likely right about their motives.

She's replaced it with a quarterly subscription managed through Gumroad, <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/sWHhq" rel="nofollow">The Goblin Friendship Club</a>.<br/><br/>It looks like there are a number of alternatives to Patreon for setting up a fixed monthly subscription model (aggregation of processing fees was the main draw Patreon had, I think; most creators I've been following reported being underwhelmed with Patreon's "social" features). I believe one can even set up such a thing as a straight up PayPal feature (I know PayPal come with their own problems, on the ethical side, but Patreon too use PayPal as their money processor). I'm wondering how to set up something like their "per creation" subscription, though, without using Patreon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468565/#Comment_468565" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-21T23:41:42+00:00" title="December 21, 2017 11:41PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that there must be something too simplistic about this, but why not just email a Paypal payment link/form/button/whatever to your subscribers every time you create something and it's time to pay? They'd get it into their mailboxes, ready to pay, and just like Patreon, continuing status as a supporter is contingent on actually following through on the promise to pay.
