                    Though I realize different people mean different things when they say "Push/Pull", some people definitely talk about Pull as an alternate play style to Push.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about this, and I wonder if the preference for Pull-style playing is really a response to the Czege principle. For those unfamiliar, the Czege principle states that having to introduce and resolve one's own adversity isn't fun. This is definitely true, I have this issue occasionally with <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, where it can be a temptation (especially in short games) to both introduce and resolve one's Fate at the same time.<br/><br/>So thinking about this, Pull-style playing could be viewed as a means to avoid this, as it requires the input of others. (Introducing Fates in tMW, as a general rule, tends to be very Pull-y.) Thoughts?                </div>

                            I think you're absoloutely right Tim.  A pull-style mechanism of conflict generation deftly avoids the Czege pit o' no-fun-ness by virture of requiring someone else's input.<br/>
<br/>
But I also think that the whole push/pull thing actually illuminates the Czege Principal in a different light.  Almost shines a light a little beyond the principal.  One could say that the reason why authoring and resolving your own adversity is less than fun is that there's no one pushing back, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Let's say you're in a push-style mechanism, pushing for conflict and no one cares about pushing back.  You'll probably have something like a 'give' about to take place.  Or a little bit of the 'say yes' action.  So; you push, there's no resistance, and you get what you want.  I suppose I can only speak for myself when I say that this result is less than satisfying.  If I push for a conflict and I get a resounding 'give' or 'say yes' response I find myself a little dissapointed.<br/>
<br/>
Or, let's say that you've got a pull-mechanism all fired up.  You've got all sorts of thematic cheese lying about, just waiting for someone at the table to pick it up and start a conflict with you.  But what if no one picks it up?  What if no one really cares that your character is alergic to cats and just got stuck in the lion cage?  No one but you.  Well, I'm imagining a situation where no one bites that cheese, no one pushes on your character when you were hoping that they would, and you're left in that same situation where you're under supplied with fun.<br/>
<br/>
I'd conclude that [Czege Principal] + [Understanding Push/Pull] = "Fun is most often derived from the adversity and conflict you share with the other players at the table."<br/>
<br/>
Yes?<br/>

<blockquote><em>One could say that the reason why authoring and resolving your own adversity is less than fun is that there's no one pushing back, right?</em></blockquote>
Hmmm... The idea certainly has potential, I'll think about it. I believe our thinking is very similar, but I'm not sure your example is a very good illustration of the Czege principle. The Czege principle doesn't say anything about <em>interest</em>, per se. <br/><br/>Also, if you're pushing a conflict and you get a "say yes" ala Dogs (was that what you were thinking?), <em>sounds</em> like they just resolved the conflict for you. It's like using dice, you introduce a conflict, roll dice, and the dice say yes.<br/><br/>Here's a real situation from tMW---a player reveals that his character's body was burned in a fire, but the Witch rescued him and restored his body on the condition that he become his servant. But *immediately* the player says that he has decided to turn his back on the Witch and help the company.<br/><br/>See, right there, he introduced a conflict ("I am the Witch's servant") but immediate resolved it ("I'm turning my back on him"). We all thought it was a cool revelation, but it didn't do much for us, as it didn't really open up any conplications in the narrative.<br/><br/>But the idea that adversity requires something external is something that people have implied before. An interesing game to take a look at is <em>Shadows</em> by... err, the same guy that did <em>Metal Opera</em>. In that game, players introduce their own conflict and narrate two possible outcomes, one possitive and one negative, but then flip a coin to decide which outcome is used. Even though the players narrate alot, it still seems "fun".<br/><br/>[edit] <em>Zak Arnston! That's who wrote</em> Shadows. [/edit]                        </div>

<i>I'd conclude that [Czege Principal] + [Understanding Push/Pull] = "Fun is most often derived from the adversity and conflict you share with the other players at the table."</i><br/><br/>That feels almost right, but I feel that it requires some strengthening of  what is meant by sharing.  If the other players are merely obligated (perhaps by mechanics, perhaps by GM herding) to get involved, fun is far from guaranteed. It is their _engagement_ (either as an appreciative audience of players, or as active, excited particpants) more than their mere participation that moves the needle.<br/><br/>Of course, that's at least somewhat implicit, but i figure the point needs emphasizing.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Y'know, that "Witch's servant" example bugged me for a bit, and I just put my finger on it - at least on paper that does not look like conflict:resolution, but instead like thesis:antithesis, with the presumed synthesis (How will these conflicting loyaltiesplay out?) to be discovered.  That said, I'm not doubting your description of how it actually went - i can entirely see how it could have been conflict:resolution -  but it struck me as curious how much framing a conflict can look like creating and resolving a conflict, and it seems this might be rich grounds for potential miscommunication.<br/>
