BS was directly inspired by Evangelion, RahXephon, and other similar works, but is it's own thing in it's own right.  <br/><br/>With Ben Lehman's approval, I've begun work on a fan computer game adaptation of Bliss Stage in the form of a Visual Novel - an interactive story in the vein of Choose Your Own Adventure books with a long history of romantic storylines.<br/><br/>The cast of this game - Bliss Stage: Love Is Your Weapon - accurately reflects the population of San Francisco, let's say? And I've been having a HELL of a time finding voice actors and actresses that are - well, not White to fill the roles of characters who aren't White at'all. <br/><br/>Do note that this IS a game about teenagers and teenage romances, including ones that become sexual. Do also note that this isn't an erotic game or story; it's one about growing up during a war and the stresses that puts on relationships. I will not ask you to act out sex scenes or say anything explicit, although the characters certainly will discuss that sort of thing the next morning and the weeks after. I'm well aware that this is a legal and moral issue; this is going to be about as explicit - or rather as chaste - as a sci-fi novel marketed to Young Adults.<br/><br/>I'm first going to release a free demonstration of the game - a fairly long one, but a free demo all the same - and because of that, I cannot pay for the work on the demo. What I CAN do is write up a contract for the volunteer voice actors that specifies that I need to hire them and license their work in the demo for the full, commercial game, if we make it.<br/><br/>Most of the characters have about 200-300 lines of dialog, total, in the demonstration.  I've posted the audition sheets to a Livejournal community. <a href="community.livejournal.com/bliss_auditions" rel="nofollow">Bliss Auditions.</a>  If you'd like to audition for a role, mail me me at blissauthority at gmail dot com with the "Auditioning for (name of character)" in the subject line and your name and contact info in the body of the e-mail.  Send your lines as attached mp3 files in a .zip folder (not a .rar folder!  I can't open those!).  <br/><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here.<br/><br/>Thank you very much in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
