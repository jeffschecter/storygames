I'm looking for some help discussing RPG stuff with non online friends; hopefully this is the right category.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo tossing around the word "story" seems to have caused some confusion in my social groups.  I sat down and thought about what I really meant by the term, and how I could defend the notion that a story necessarily has theme (and what theme really is).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn trying to contrast this with other forms of writing, I considered Journalism.  Right now I've got the idea that what I mean by "story" is something that has, as the term goes, a "moral of the story", and lacking a moral of the story, we end up with "a bunch of data".<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Journalism defined by presenting data in a way devoid of "a moral"?  Is it useful to consider attempting to play an RPG not to create a "story," but to perform "fictional journalism"?  Is "journalism" a good way of describing "Sim" play if I want to talk about theory stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nE                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68123/#Comment_68123" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T16:47:25+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  4:47PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya, Eric.<br/><br/>Let's start with: by "a story necessarily has a theme" are you talking about a theme that is determined prior to the telling of the story, or that is developed through the telling of the story?

You can't say something without meaning something.</p>\n<p>But you can try. The cool, removed, stoic, and frankly autistic perspective that is prevalent in many RPGs (as well as wargames \xe2\u20ac\u201d you're sending thousands of dudes to their deaths with a wave of your hand) is a power thing, I think. "I'm so powerful, I'm unmoved by these deaths."</p>\n<p>But remember: "Objective Journalism" was invented by William Randolph Hearst in the interest of not offending advertisers. The same man who said, "You furnish the pictures. I'll furnish the war."</p>\n<p>So that means that, if you intend to say <em>something</em> in your story making process, the rules of the game should give you the pieces you need to say that. It means playing a game where you must take a moral stance; where you can sacrifice fictional things for other fictional things that metaphorically stand for real life things that you care about. Win or lose, as a player, you've made a statement when the conflict is over.</p>\n<p>It sounds to me (correct me if I'm wrong) that the question here is whether a "story" is "the events as they objectively, and therefore truly, happened" or it's "the statement made by the arrangement of fictional elements."

The essential difference, he suspects, is that the former in each case is thematic while the latter in each case is not. He defines "theme" as "the moral of the story": the argument it makes or the lesson it teaches.<br/><br/>(Let's stipulate that we don't need the terms narr or sim right now; we can just say, "One mode of play . . . " and "Another, contrasting mode of play . . . " without evoking a whole slew of GNS baggage. Eric is mostly concerned with the appropriateness of the analogy, I think).<br/><br/>I think the analogy holds up, but in a trickier sense that deserves some thinking about. The thing about journalistic conventions of objectivity is that they mask the extent to which assumptions about how the world works are built into the routines and practices of reporting in a way that's not the case in literary writing, which is intended to call those assumptions into question. Literary writing is supposed to make us re-examine taken-for-granteds about the world and the things in it. I'm re-reading Harlan Ellison's anthology, <i>Dangerous Visions</i>, right now, and there's a story in it by David Bunch called "Incident in Moderan" where the narrator is a buffed-up cyborg warlord who like all the other citizens of Moderan is happy as a clam in his gleaming Stronghold punching the launch buttons to fire missile after missile in endless and pointless warfare, his hate a thing of joy. When a "flesh-bum" approaches his Stronghold during a brief truce to thank him for his decency in halting his fire so that he could bury his son, the narrator is puzzled: the cease-fire was so that some other Strongholds could repair their ammo loops and thus enable a more glorious and destructive war. When the flesh-bum is burned to a crisp by the resumed fire, the narrator shrugs and returns to his launch buttons. This story is "thematic" in the sense that calls attention to our ideas about what it means to be human, and points ironically back at us as we read it.<br/><br/>A newspaper report about a man being killed does exactly the opposite: it assumes a particular set of ideas, and proceeds from them. The conventions of objectivity mean that news reports follow a script, and so we know what information we'd expect to see in such a story: who died, how, under what circumstances, and whose fault it was, with the additional fillip that the death must be somehow "newsworthy" in order to warrant coverage. We are not challenged in our assumptions about how the world works; instead, we are confirmed in them.<br/><br/>Within the same medium, then (i.e., print), there are two different modes of dealing with "theme": dig it up or bury it deep. Is the same true of RPGs?<br/><br/>I'm inclined to say yes, and that you can look to a game's system the way you'd look to a newspaper story's content-in-context to identify its ideological presuppositions.<br/><br/>Of course, the analogy breaks down at the point where you say, "but literary fiction and news reporting are separate genres, and RPGs don't really have such a thing as separate genres for games." But that's when somebody would say, "And that's what GNS gives us."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68184/#Comment_68184" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T23:43:47+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 11:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Bill says makes a lot of sense to me.

Newman</cite>Bill, my point is that, say, a wargame has already taken a moral stance about what's going on; that's not what the players decide. Likewise, such decisions have been made in a game designed to represent a pre-existing environment. By playing such a game in the way it is intended, you are making the only choice available in that regard: whether or not to buy into the moral statement made by the game's design.(I'm by no means saying that, if you play the Axis in Axis and Allies that you're a Fascist; I mean that in order for the game to be any fun, you have to want the Nazis, Fascisti, and Imperial Japan to win. Viz. The Battle for Tarkut, the ongoing Mechaton campaign between Vincent, Emily CB and me. I'm playing separatist terrorists, Emily's playing imperialists, Vincent's playing nationalists.)</blockquote>\nJoshua -- I agree with you; there is a particular "moral order" built into the activity of a wargame just as there's one built into the activity of journalism. In a wargame that moral ordering is strictly neutral, as you suggest: there are no "good guys" or "bad guys" per se, only opposing sides of equal merit. Nor are we supposed to draw any moral from the victory of either the Allies or the Axis in a game of Axis &amp; Allies. But the game does incorporate a model of "how things (ought to) work": troops obey, commanders command, war machines produce materiel. The moral ordering of journalism as an activity is a little different; the ethos of (post-Watergate) journalism valorizes being a "watchdog" on government and political officials, championing the "little guy", speaking truth to power. The reality of journalistic practice is a little different, of course, with its cozy interdependence with and reliance upon official sources and its relative inattention to voices outside the already-powerful, and that too is part of the moral ordering of journalism.<br><br>Bracket all that stuff off, and concentrate for a second on the idea of authoring, in the sense of making a (thematic) statement by virtue of the choices one makes in creating a text -- whether that text is the recorded moves of a board game, a newspaper report of a murder, a short story, or the transcript of a roleplaying game session. To what extent have I created, or helped create, a narrative of grit and determination if I play a chess game in which my forces are slowly ground down by your superior manuevering but I manage to even things up with a few desperate exchanges and eventually force a draw by perpetual check? Now, the moral ordering of chess is built into the game: two sides, equal in dignity, neither one in and of itself "good" or "bad." But the choices made by the player(s) to some extent "tell a story" with a particular moral. Is that right?<br/><br/>And if that's authoring, well then what isn't? You'd have to say that an activity moves further away from authoring the more the choices available to the creators of the text are constrained by the "rules of the game." And to the extent that much news reporting is exactly so constrained, routinized by the organizations in which it is located and standardized by competitive pressures with other organizations, it is less "authored" than a short story.<br/><br/>Of course, I bet many journalists would vociferously protest that characterization, and I'm willing to give them their due. Let's forget about that, and stick with games.<br/><br/>Does the notion of different levels of "authoring" help us make sense of the distinction that Eric was trying to raise way up top in the OP?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68380/#Comment_68380" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-10T19:07:32+00:00" title="May 10, 2007  7:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Wow, Bill, this is just me saying that what you've got there is quite pithy.<br/><br/>Mike</blockquote>\nHey, Mike -- Thanks!

And I think Joshua is right to imply that there are some authorial choices the designer of a game reserves for him or herself ("hirself," I should say, since it's Joshua), and that the more such choices the designer so reserves, the less "thematic" play is possible.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Isn't that exactly what underlies notions that "the game's mechanics are the physics of the game-world"?

Journalism is about taking what you encounter around them and creating a story where no story existed previously.<br/><br/>Journalism isn't a book report, where the story exists already. Journalism is about fabricating a story out of non-story material.<br/><br/>Likewise, so is every act of story creation.<br/><br/>What is creating a story? It is taking things that surround you and building a story from non-story material. Stories do not simply exist; they are made, even journalistic endeavors.<br/><br/>As for constraint, constraints don't have a downward effect on the creativeness, the "authoring" component of a story. I'm not just talking about journalistic constraints, I'm talking about any sort of constraints, such as short stories or mysteries or whatever. If anything, constraints force a greater sense of authorism, of creative construction of a story, than lack of constraints.

So now I'm back to my original quandary of "how do I differentiate a coherent block of text from a story?"  Because the very existence of the Sim category seems to me to indicate that people can work to present information without being engaged in story construction (with my really, really loose definition of story construction as constructing theme).<br/><br/>Right now I'm thinking that maybe I conflated the concept of Journalism with the concept of <em>research</em>.

I should maybe have said "displays less authorial presence," since we as readers are (supposed to be) less aware of the individual writer behind the straight news piece.

If people have other definitions that they're using, I'm interested in hearing any!<br/><br/>I'm going to start talking like I know what I'm talking about for a bit.  Don't let the tone fool you into thinking that yourself!<br/><br/>I do not believe that all presentation of data necessarily creates theme.  Otherwise there'd be no such thing as Narrativist play, as <em>all</em> play would be Narrativist.<br/><br/>From what I understand of Sim, a game has a "Thing that <strong>IS</strong>," and the play itself is about exploring, researching and reinforcing that thing, while <em>absolutely not creating theme</em> with our actions (since if we're creating theme with our actions, we're playing Narrativist.)  Not to say that there is no theme present in the outcome of our actions, but if there is, it is imposed upon those actions and not created by them.  (Railroad Sim can have theme, after all, but not created by the actions of the players).<br/><br/>In summary, I think this thread was very helpful in learning about storytelling vs. journalism.  I've still got more things I now need to think about regarding the base issue of narrativism vs simulationism, but I didn't want to create a thread about those issues and I don't want to turn this one into such a thread.<br/><br/>Especially when it's already got such an interesting conversation going on already!  When I said "tangentially interested," I most absolutely not mean that dismissively.  I meant to say, "okay, I got what I needed, thank you, and please keep talking because even though my question is answered this is still interesting"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68674/#Comment_68674" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T08:15:58+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  8:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another way, at least in the US, that much journalism is more "constructed" than fiction is that there is a truly straitjacketed formalized abstracted style that all news stories must fit into. Not all do, but most do.  No one would ever talk, or try to engage an audience, with the unholy amalgamation that constitutes "style" among most news stories unless they were forced to. This is because of the reality of wire services needing to "sound like" one, highly non-distinctive voice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JongWK" title="JongWK"><img alt="JongWK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JongWK">JongWK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69068/#Comment_69068" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T17:45:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  5:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mule</cite><br/>Is Journalism defined by presenting data in a way devoid of "a moral"?
