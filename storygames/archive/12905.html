Here is how I setup a game with my friends:<br/>\n1) Agree on a game<br/>\n2) Agree on theme, play style (meaning pvp, good.evil play, etc.) and any others "I wont this"/"I don't want that" issues<br/>\n3) while the players make characters, I immerse myself in the details of the setting. Often I will make lists of factions and figure out why they do what they do and who would be political/philosophical allies/enemies<br/>\n4) Players come to the table with cool characters and I come to the table with a cool world. then I try and figure out the characters' motivations and hit them. Letting the world react organically to their mis-adventures.<br/>\nSo, the world is free to explore, but the improvisation is driven by my knowledge and understanding of an established setting (even if the setting is established by the group like in PTA).<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290571/#Comment_290571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:42:05+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2010 2:47PM by Irminsul.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don\u2019t see why not.

The first several years of play for me involved hours and hours of out-of-game discussion. It was an Ars Magica inspired world, built by the players of the group as a whole, with major portions focused on by individuals. I came to it late, so instead of reading volumes of canon for play, I got to have the pleasure of talking with my friends about the world they'd built. What was the history of this political faction of mages? Why did these others specialize in that form of magic? <br/><br/>That particular game had a long, slow build and was focused on letting us all play many characters and explore the game at leisure. If that is what you'd like to bring in, I can't recommend the colloborative world building and discussion enough. If you'd like that, then share the Sandbox.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290574/#Comment_290574" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T14:47:58+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  2:47PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Must it be so polarised?

For example, if you think out interesting locations, challenging GMC's, strange events, compelling hooks, and other pleasant surprises for the players to discover and interact with, your enthusiasm and example may well encourage the players' input, while you let them take the lead in defining the fiction and always keep the stage open for a chance in the spotlight. But the game cannot <i>live or die</i> by your interesting locations, challenging GMC's, strange events, compelling hooks, and other pleasant surprises\u2014those have to be there for the players to take or leave.<br/><br/>It sounds like you have lots of fun building up the world outside the game session\u2014and that's totally okay, so long as you know what you're getting into ahead of time. To run a player-driven game you have to remember that those things not the plot and main characters, but the set and backdrop and costume closet, things for the players to play with and on if they so choose. Many of them will get ignored, and that's also totally okay.<br/><br/>Cultivate non-attachment.
