                    So last night my group got together and played a little Capes, and it... really didn't work.  I'm not entirely sure why.<br/><br/>The Players &amp; Characters: I myself played Moose-Boy, preteen animal-powered wannabe superhero; Judson played Lt Krug, a space bounty hunter come to do something unpleasant on earth; Mark played Senor Demiurgo, the guilt-ridden godling who was depressed that creation sucked so much.<br/><br/>We played two scenes.  In the first scene, we started off with the Conflict: Football players bully Moose-Boy.  I was pretty engaged here, but I got the feeling that Judson (who started the conflict) didn't quite know how to forward it, and Mark had Senor Demiurgo look on morosely as the world he created displayed its pettiness.  On the second page, Mark and I both threw out conflicts concerning Lt Krug's spaceship, which he had just landed in.  Mark's was that its regeneration drives started sapping the life out of the park; mine was that the spaceship would get a parking ticket.  The bullies conflict resolved and we focused more on the spaceship, with Lt Krug trying to distract the meter maid, Moose-Boy pointing out the obvious ("It's so big it doesn't fit in a parking space!"), and Senor Demiurgo vaporizing the parking lines from existence so that now it did fit into a double-wide space.<br/><br/>Those conflicts resolved and we very nearly stopped there.  It seemed like there was tons of fiddly bits to toy with but that nothing was really driving the fiction in an interesting direction.  We decided to give it one more try, with a more active scene with something really at stake.<br/><br/>So Mark started up the next scene where Senor Demiurgo was going to get so fed up with the universe that he was going to drink himself into a coma so he could forget about existence, thus negating it.  He put out a conflict to that tune; I put out an Event where Senor Demiurgo explained his motivations to Krug and Moose-Boy (minor point: this was a slight bit of strategy since my conflict would have to be resolved before his, at least sensibly, although there really isn't anything in the rules to stipulate that).  We then went around the table with actions a few times; Demiurgo tried to drink himself into oblivion while Krug tried to talk him out of it and Moose-Boy ended up trashing the entire bar to stop him.  Eventually, Demiurgo decided to take up a rewarding career helping underprivileged youths, who he promptly named the Destruction Patrol because they were going to help him destroy the universe by hand (two more conflicts that got introduced).<br/><br/>We ended with the same slightly dissatisfied sense, where the game really didn't seem to take off or create anything significant or meaningful or engaging.  The entire experience seemed to entail a lot of spinning wheels but nothing that made anybody care about what was happening.<br/><br/>Now, one thing that I know we did wrong was that we were spending more debt than the rating of the drive they were being spent out of; we missed that rule until the end of the game.  So it was common for me to spend three or four debt out of my Hope drive, which was only rated 2, for splits.  This meant there were more and smaller dice out there than there might normally be, but on the other hand I don't see why the only sensible character build is to rate one drive at 5 and the other four at 1, which would make just about everything we did legal.<br/><br/>One possible disconnect might be in our characters, which were high on the silly and low on sympathy.  If Capes is about investing in conflicts that you care about and you don't especially care about your character, it's hard to try and capture the other players' attentions with conflicts you throw out there.<br/><br/>In any case, the entire night was flat and pretty uninteresting.  Nothing popped or sizzled or went anywhere; after the first scene we kept playing because we wanted to try again to "do it right" but after neither scene did I want to play again because of any intrinsic quality of the game.  Now, I've played Capes (Lite) before and didn't have this problem, and I've read tons and tons of AP reports that didn't have this problem, so it seems to me that <em>something</em> went wrong, but I can't figure out what.  Any thoughts?                </div>

<br/>
I think your self-diagnosis is spot on. And there are tons of AP reports that had this precise problem, too, so you're not alone.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Question</b>: Did you and your group talk about the kind of vibe you wanted for the game <i>before</i> creating your characters? I ask because<br/>
(a) the angsty teen superhero, alien bounty hunter, and dark-comic deity don't seem to mesh, and<br/>
(b) lots of people realize (correctly) that <i>Capes</i> is incompatible with hard-core traditional GM prep and then assume (incorrectly!) that <i>Capes</i> requires no prep at all.<br/>
<br/>
It really, really helps if either the group as a whole -- or one strong "leader" type, e.g. Tony at a demo -- sets the tone with strong, specific ideas: "Okay, so as the first scene opens, Magneto levitates smugly over the smouldering ruins of Washington, DC" or "you know that scene in <i>Killing Joke</i> where Batman and the Joker start laughing together? That's the kind of stuff I want."<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that brings to mind a<br/>
<br/>
<b>Second Question</b>: Were your earlier, more successful <i>Capes Light</i> games with this same group or with other people?<br/>
<br/>
Sheer speculation here: With a <i>different</i> group of people, you yourself may have naturally stepped up into a "leader" mode as you introduced the game to them -- not only explaining the rules, but also (implicitly) setting the tone. But with your old accustomed group of players, you didn't feel comfortable being "in charge" like that (at least not with a "look ma, no GM!" game). So you kinda sat back and waited for them to do what they wanted, and they kinda sat back waiting for you to do what you wanted, and so nobody did want anybody wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Sound at all familiar? I suspect this phenomenon is going on with a lot of "flat" <i>Capes</i> play I read about. If there's one thing the game is missing, it's a practical "hey, here's how to jump-start fun play!" guide, I've come to think.<br/>
<br/>
(This is something Vincent's <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> does beautifully, with the GM advice, the recurring example of the storekeeper's wife, Initiation, and the Town Creation rules, but of course <i>Dogs</i> doesn't have as sophisticated a resource economy as <i>Capes</i> does once you get it going. Damn, I want to play the game that has both, but it hasn't been written yet).                        </div>

                            Being another player in this game, I can address some of what you're talking about, Sydney, and provide some of my own point of view on  the game, as well.<br>
<br>
First of all, we did have fun over ??Capes.??  Except that it was more despite it rather than because of it.  The characters we created were sort of wacky.  "Angsty teenaged hero" is not how I would have described Moose-Boy (whose primary power was "Enraged Ungulate"), and Lt. Krug Steel concept was "...from space!"  So we did have a coherent vision of our game - wacky existentialism.  Think Grant Morrison's ??Doom Patrol?? without the pomo self-reference.<br>
<br>
One of the big concerns we had was that the "sophisticated resource management" and the multiple loops of turn order, all seemed to be neat and all, but we were uncertain about what they were in aid of.  We found a couple of weird twists in the rules that pushed things all kind of haywire.  For instance:<br>
<br>
!http://static.flickr.com/49/148005808_42f7f02723.jpg?v=0!<br>
<br>
Is that supposed to happen?  Well, no, but we had similar conflicts with more reasonably sized (but still huge) splits.<br>
<br>
It was suggested at one point that without Tony, the game goes haywire, and I've been musing about that since.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
From the fact that there are, what, 10 Debt Tokens and ten dice on one side, and no Debt and the single lousy default die stuck at "one" on the other side, it doesn't look like anyone opposed the winners here, which (by the rules) means their Debt vanishes without turning into Story Tokens for <i>anybody</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Now, conceivably, someone could've been vigorously rolling all those dice on the winning side <i>down</i>, which would explain them all being 1s, in which case that player would count as "opposition" and deserve Story Tokens... but that seems improbable.                        </div>

                            Actually, that example does bring up an interesting rules-question we had.  Is this an allowable sequence of moves:<br/>
<br/>
Action: Use Ability to roll up a die<br/>
Spend Debt to Split said die<br/>
Reaction: Use Ability to roll up one of the split dice.<br/>
<br/>
Which, if that's allowable, begs the corrollary question:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Now, for sake of argument, I believe that as that conflict got split into 10 ones, the previous dice did get rolled down by both Josh and I.  (Or one of us rolled down, the other rolled up, and then Mark rolled it back to a one.)  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we did have the lasting complaint that particularly significant rules vanish into the depths of the book.  Specifically, as we read it, story tokens could be assigned to anyone, except yourself.  If we were wrong in that, it's not the only thing.<br/>
<br/>
But that does bring up the significant frustration that at least I had with ??Capes,?? namely the arrangement of the rules text.  A single page, incredibly terse explanation of the flow of a scene would have made it much easier to follow what was going on, especially with a game like ??Capes?? where the rules are sort of complex.  And I make this criticism acknowledging that I'm prone to the same level of complexity and questionable explanation.                        </div>

                            We also thought that 5 drives were too many and/or that the listed drives were too broad. <br/>
<br/>
We all tended to focus on one or two of them during play. A smaller number of drives would still cover almost any action and would help give more definition to characters.                        </div>

                            Yeah, five drives, defined broadly, really gave me very little sense of character.  I feel like three more tightly-defined drives would be far more compelling.<br/>
<br/>
Because I can make anything about Love.  Or Hope.  Or Truth.  So the restriction of making the conflict about your Drive did not limit my options to a great degree.                        </div>

<p>Wow.  They got split 5 and 5?  That's ... that's odd.  If two out of three players were providing opposition by acting in favor of the no-debt-staked side, why was it still sitting at a 1?  Shouldn't it be at least a three or a four?</p>

<p>Did he earn a lot of story tokens while he was sucking up that pile of debt?</p>
<p>I mean, if he's losing conflicts where he's staked debt, my instincts tell me that someone else must have been staking debt on the opposing side (or else, y'know, he would have won).  But the sight of ten dice, all of them ones, makes me wonder whether my instincts are applicable in this case.</p>

                            I don't know if this will help anyone, but I have recently found the magic words to make Capes work really well for me, so I'll share them here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everything in the Capes book is just "Bringing Down the Pain" rules.</i><br/>
<br/>
If you're not getting into extended conflict resolution, you don't use any of that stuff. Just "play" like you play any RPG -- like TSOY, to pick a particularly great example.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason (because Capes is presented solely as a turn-by-turn CR system, I guess) I went into it thinking that's <i>all</i> it was. Like, all you did was take turns creating Goals and Events and rolling dice up and down. But -- duh! -- that's just the CR component. The rest of play is bog-standard narration and "my guy does this" RPG play. Ding!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why it took me so long to figure that out, but I'm glad I did.                        </div>

                            I don't know yet. I had this revelation after the last Capes game and haven't tried it yet.<br/>
<br/>
But I imagine it would be like any other CR game. At some point, someone says something and someone else says "No way!" and a Goal appears on the table.<br/>
<br/>
How that relates to the active player order and such is... less clear. But I don't see it as a huge problem.<br/>

But now I have to ask: How do you do it, Tony?                        </div>

<p>My group does it all in the conflict resolution system.  We're having a conversation in the mess hall about girls?  Fine with me ... what's the conflict and who's gonna stake debt on it?</p>
<p>But I'm certainly interested to hear your experiences trying it your way.  I'm pretty fond of the "just talking" thing as a possible design tool, and I'm thinking a lot these days about the mental shift from that mode to a conflict-resolution mode, and how to make it more natural and less abrupt than it sometimes is.</p>

                            My experience with Trollbabe (and Stranger Things), TSOY, Nine Worlds, and Dogs has been that drifting into the CR system is pretty painless. The techniques we're using to do that bear some scrutiny, though.<br/>
<br/>
In games that demand conflicts as scene resolution (PTA, Capes) I've seen the occasional jarring switch, right when everyone goes, "Oh yeah... we need to have a conflict here. What will it be?" Not every turn -- not by a long shot -- but sometimes.                        </div>

                            I think I've found the answer to that -- you can Use an Ability on Inspirations. So you can get that 1 Inspiration and roll it up on your Action.<br>
<br>
Yeah. Just that you do not have to roll. Just use an ability and you can increase the inspiration.                        </br></br></div>

                            Take this with a grain of salt, since I've never played Capes, only read Capes Lite, but one of the brilliant things about Once Upon A Time (the only narration-passing game I've ever actually played) is that everyone has a place they're trying to get the story to go - not just "and then this happens", but "this happens, the end!"  This might be a really solid, practical thing to talk about early on. Not just "comics" but "this is the story of the formation of the Legue of Awesomeness".or "this is how my superhero outfit ended up getting washed with something red and got to be pink" or whatever, you can really set your tone. I actually do like the silly characters and situations inherent in supers comics (Justice League International represent, yo) so I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with frivolity and not being invested. You just need to have some explicit idea of the madcap pace you're trying to keep up.                        </div>

                            In our own games, we have seen very similar situations, to the one decribed by Joshua (with all those small dice on one side), but now I realize this was based on a mistaken interpretation of the staking rules.  Its easy to end up something simliar to the above if you can split BEFORE reactions:<br>
<br>
My side currently has a 5 and a 2, with two debt staked by someone else.<br>
I roll the 2 to a 5.  <br>
I stake 8 debt off of my SERIOUSLY overdrawn drive.<br>
I split everything down to ones.<br>
I say, "any reactions?"<br>
<br>
In fact, its not a bad tactic, if you want to WIN, not just win inspirations, because it prevents anyone from rolling down your side on the reaction.<br>
<br>
But as Tony points out, this is wrong.  I have to give everyone a round of reactions to the 5 before I can do anything, and once the reactions are over, the temptation to split to ones is not nearly as great.  You can still stake the debt, but you can leave the dice unsplit, especially if you know you are going to win.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have another question for Joshua and Judson: With 10 debt on one side, I have to assume that more than one person staked debt, because the maximum any one character can stake is their drive strength, and that has a maximum of 5.  Or was this something that you might have missed?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Larry:  Dude, it's an entire plot-thread.  Magmar the molten man and Comet-Lad, adonis-like youth from the stars, are room-mates in their Tower of Solipsism.</p>

<p>Given how often young and irresponsible teams of egotistical super-heroes (yeah, Teen Titans, I'm lookin' at <strong>you</strong>) live and work together in huge spaces with no apparent maintenance crew, I figure it's not "How could you put it into play?" but rather "How have people ignored this issue for so long?"</p>

                            Yeah, I was suggesting those things not as specific conflicts or stakes or whatever ooh da lolly stuff is part of your particular narration-passing game of chioce, I was suggesting them as agreed-upon structures which can help narration-passing folks be comfortable with each other - "on the same page" is a cliche and not that helpful but it's a bit of what I'm after.                        </div>

                            You got it, Joshua.  The rules (page 36) could be interpreted either way, I think, but the FAQ has a link to a thread where Tony states it fairly clearly.<br/>

edited to change Josh to Joshua, since we haven't been formally introduced.                        </div>

                            And I'd got futher to offer the humble criticism that the three of us are usually pretty good at reading and following rules.  I think that a game that depends as much on a fragile rules as ??Capes?? does needs to explain those rules a lot more clearly.                        </div>

                            That's a funny thing. I can see how lots of people have trouble decoding the rules from Capes. When I read it, I was all "Whoa. The example of play makes it all come together." It clicked for me. On the other hand, Tony often makes sense to me when other people are going "Dude. Chill out. Are you insane?"                        </div>

Personally, I want a clear reference before I want examples.  I have a hard time getting into the example where I can reconstruct a lot out of a clear reference.  I'm just more of a Napoleonic Code[1] guy, I guess.<br/>

                            Hey Tony,<br/>
<br/>
I found the post from the Capes forum that resonated with me regarding "free play" and how conflicts start. I'm sure you saw it, but here's the link for anyone who was interested in that idea.<br/>
