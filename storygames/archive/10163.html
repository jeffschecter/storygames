My intent here is not to cast aspersions, but to reflect on my own rhetorical style, and to invite others to do so as well. Look at this as a self-directed thing, and join in if you like.]<br/><br/>The way I talk about game design and game play\u2014most of the time\u2014predicts that a certain kind of roleplayer will exist. I have talked about RPGs for the past 5 years or so, confident that such people exist, talking about them, and so on. Well, I recently came upon empirical evidence that proves their existence, and the shock it caused me when I recognized what I'd found tells me something about myself.<br/><br/>It tells me I'd been talking about straw men all this time, and tricked myself into not realizing it.<br/><br/>The specifics:\n<ul>\n<li>My take on game play and design says that certain kinds of games will tend to either produce certain kinds of play, or find players who prefer a certain kind of play.</li>\n<li>Specifically, games which only "care" in their rules about fighting ought to service (or produce?) players who do not want to engage very much\u2014if at all\u2014in roleplaying.</li>\n<li>There therefore ought to be people who think roleplaying is a distraction, a problem, a waste of their time, etc.</li>\n</ul>\nLike I said, for about five years I've been talking about game playing and game design as though all of the above is true. I was confident that it was extremely likely. A given, to the extent that my science-obsessed pedantry over the word "truth" allowed me to see it as such. <br/><br/>So: upon choosing after Gen Con to listen to a bunch of podcasts I'd never tried before, I discovered that I was right, and experiencing the reality of such players shocked the shit out of me.<br/><br/>A few of the shows I listened to were discussing whether roleplaying during your sessions was appropriate, or how much of it to allow before it became a problem, or how one should curtail roleplaying so that if you had any players who were interested in it, it wouldn't get in the way of the game. This really surprised me. I mean, the fundamental act of the game was, in my opinion, something that these folks really didn't want to deal with. "I want to get to the next challenge and not worry about the minutiae," was literally the sentiment expressed in one case.<br/><br/>So I got to thinking about why I was so surprised. I think it's because what I think is true about design and play, is true, and maybe on some level I never fully believed it without realizing that I didn't. I mean most of my gaming life (from about 1982 to about 2005) involved playing mainstream games where almost all if not all of the rules and game text were about tactically overcoming challenges. But we\u2014the groups I was a part of\u2014always tried to make stories together. We used fights as ways to punctuate the story, to introduce tension and excitement in service of the story.<br/><br/>So, yeah. I think I'm even righter than I thought I was about things, and it weirds me out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225542/#Comment_225542" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T16:39:48+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  4:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. I think most of us, and probably even you, recognized and agreed with this stance to a degree even before.<br/><br/>This is why we have scene-framing and aggressive scene-framing, because we want to curtail role-playing that we think had reached its conclusion, and is just treading water.<br/><br/>A dynamic discussion between several characters is one thing, but I've once had a discussion between a couple of characters (The Paladin, and the thief who joined the party mid-dungeon) for, about 2 real life hours, and then when it was 'resolved', it came up two sessions later, a repeat, for another hour or so, till I had said, as the thief, to the paladin, "Let's put a cap on it, we're in a bloody dungeon, and I've helped you guys in the fight, and discuss this when we go to town, in front of the magister.")<br/><br/>Role-playing is fine, but it can be excessive, it can be disruptive (when two players do it and the rest of the players have to twiddle their thumbs). I am not so sure how many people, even here, disagree with that.<br/><br/>But hm, thinking about it, this is not thinking that RP is by its essence, by some sort of intrinsic value, disruptive, but that it should be constrained when it no longer furthers the agenda, or introduces new content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley" title="MickBradley"><img alt="MickBradley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.canonpuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/mick-blackhat1001.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley">MickBradley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225543/#Comment_225543" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T16:40:06+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  4:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm totally grokking you, Rob.

The biggest issues revolve around the usage of words.  For example "Role-Playing" means any number of things based on the biases and experiences of the talker.  In most discussions the first thing that must be done is to agree on terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does Role-Playing mean?  This is where Clyde (Theory from the Closet) has the right idea but the wrong answer.  He postulates that instead of calling this pastime a role-playing game we should call it "This Thing We Do"(ttwd).  The issue there is that what an RPG is, is based on the collective works that come before us.  Clyde is on the right track, ttwd is not some dictionary definition, it is role-playing.  In order to define role-playing one would have to come up with a definition that includes every example of what we know to be role-playing, ttwd.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that role-playing has two clear definitions.  One is "playing a role-playing game" and the other is "speaking as if in character" or a similar permutation.  So we have what one might consider a bait and switch fallacy.  We can argue all day over nothing when we use different definitions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWords are of course merely the signpost of ideas.  When I point at the moon no one mistakes my finger for the moon.  And really I do not comprehend what the moon is, I'm just pointing at it.  So that's where arguing about what a role-playing game causes us to miss the point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs DnD 4e a role-playing game?  Is Shadowrun? Vampire? Eclipse Phase? Alpha Omega? Burning wheel?  My life with master?  All yes, because they are.  (or, they are not but the use of the term in no way changes the actuality of what they are.  Just the same as it not mattering if I point at the moon with my left or right hand.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI refuse to look down on people because they differ in terminology or desires.  When I was working on what would become our payout theory my number one test for truth was in it not requiring any existing group to be stupid for doing what they liked.  For example LARPers.  By no measure are they playing a "very good" game, however they are playing as much of a game that allows them to do what they want.  In this case dressing up and full body acting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225595/#Comment_225595" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T21:10:10+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  9:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most useful way for me to think about this is that "roleplaying" is a set of techniques used within the broader category of "game".<br/><br/>So "roleplaying games" are games that use some of these techniques.  There's a fair range of opinions on which techniques fit into the category, and how many of the techniques are required before a game can be labled a roleplaying game, but there's pretty broad consensus on what fits in the "core" group of roleplaying techniques.<br/><br/>Some techniques that are commonly found in games labeled "roleplaying games" are:<br/><br/>Speaking as if you are a fictional character<br/>Describing the actions of fictional characters<br/>Having a single "game piece" that you control<br/>Mechanics that simulate violence<br/>Increasing in-game effectiveness<br/>One player with greater responsibilities and authority<br/>A "shared imagined space"<br/>Using polyhedral dice<br/>Playing from a book with "Dungeons and Dragons" written on the cover<br/><br/>and so on.<br/><br/>To confuse the issue, some of these techniques are sometimes called "roleplaying", especially the "talking in character" and "shared imagined space" ones.  This leads me to beleive that these techniques are pretty central to most people's idea of a roleplaying game - but not everyone's.<br/><br/>So to address Rob's point:  <br/><br/>Yes, there are people who don't like some of the techniques that are commonly found in many roleplaying games.  They may even dislike some of the techniques that you think of as "core" to what makes a roleplaying game.  I imagine the surprise you feel is the same surprise people feel when you say "I like games without a GM" or "I don't like games with violence".  They're like "well what are you playing rpgs for?"<br/><br/>The most interesting idea that comes out of this for me is "can you have an RPG without a shared imagined space?" I don't really know the answer to that, but I suspect that you can.  You can just about play 4E without a shared imagined space, but not quite, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
