The premise behind the group is to have a place where different gamers who are interested in indie/story games to:<br/>\n(A) find out more about them<br/>\n(B) discuss them<br/>\n(C) meet others interested and socialize to compare playing styles, personal styles, interests, and just generally to see if the clutch engages for their type of gaming without having to commit to a full blown game or campaign. <br/>\n(D) a place where different gaming groups can mix it up to see what other gamers in the area are doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt meets at a low-key location that is well lit, has good food and drinks, but you can just get by with a coffee or tea if you want. It is in central houston, at River Oaks Cafe Express. It is currently a small group with the first meeting for the 31st of March, but am hoping to get the word out and have meetings at least once a month if not bi-weekly. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the link to the group. Note there is no cost to join the meetup group. ---&gt; http://roleplayers.meetup.com/404/?gj=sj3<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
