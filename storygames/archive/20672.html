It's like, "good advice" found in a book has always less wight than "good advice" given by whoever taught you the game. <br/><br/>It's as if spoken advice tends to become an unwritten rule easier than written good advice. I mean, I was surprised too when everyone was badmouthing VtM for having an umbalanced dice mechanics and JD brought to light that there's a whole chapter of good advice in the book explaining how you shouldn't be rolling dice and rely instead on comparing stats and only roll the dice when it's harder to decide what makes sense in the current situation.<br/><br/>I often see lots of important procedures and things that are relly important to achieve a nice gameplay getting lost in a good play advice chapter that nobody takes seriously, instead of actually make those things part of the rules, because the designer thinks they sound silly as rules, because they feel like everyone knows better how to handle things at their table and it will come out as an impolite imposition.<br/><br/>A couple of other things helped me change my mind on the subject. One is the rules for the Dragonball boardgame, which a friend of mine translated from japanese. They explicitly say as one of the first rules that "players shouldn't get angry when playing the game and refrain from violent outbursts while playing it" <br/><br/>It was something along those lines and though yes, we thought the translation sounded silly, when we played the game we came to understand why: there are moments where the game and player moves become so unfair that it quite easy to forget it's just a game. Bringing that up in the rules then made up much more sense.<br/><br/>Another thing that changed my mind was some of the first part of the Tenra Bansho corebook, where players are reminded of the game objectives: having fun and helping others have fun. The whole game is built up around this philosophy and you will find out that if you try and play it like D&amp;D or fiasco the thing just won't click. For Tenra Bansho it makes more sense to let the party split and for players to have scenes by themselves, at lest from the start and then let the rest of the players incorporate to the current scene if they want so.<br/><br/>So, if the original concept around D&amp;D was for players to play single characters in stories about exploration, adventure and survival, what part there makes sense to have random things ruin immersion and call it part of the fun? It makes a lot more of sense to think that people just watched the random tables, wanted to use them as they were because they thought it would be fun and forget to read the advice that these were there for inspiration and not as something you should be using always.<br/><br/>But it's not like I had noticed this before you posted this, it's too easy to follow everyone's advice instead of reading by yourself and realizing everyone has been playing the game the wrong way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453874/#Comment_453874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-15T23:45:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2016 11:45PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The opposite of a brilliant idea is not necessarily a stupid idea; sometimes it's a brilliant idea too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453876/#Comment_453876" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T05:17:10+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  5:17AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's just\u2026 it's just that this almost kills the interest I had in the game.<br/>I've referred to the sort of gameplay that this section recommends as a "curated experience".

The part Sandra refers to is in the expert rules DM section p. 25:<br/><br/><i>A common error while Dungeon Mastering is the use of random dice rolls to determine everything. An entire evening can be spoiled if (for example) an unplanned wilderness encounter on the way to the dungeon goes bad for the party. The DM must use good judgment in addition to random tables. Encounters should be scaled to the strength of the party and should be in harmony with the theme of the adventure.<br/><br/>The DM may choose a number within the given die range rather than roll for the amount of damage, number appearing, etc. This may be necessary to allow for a more enjoyable game; heavy damage early in the game may spoil some of the fun.</i><br/><br/>That's not kosher, I agree. However, I also think that it's an imposed interpretation context (that is, you're arbitrarily setting outside standards for what the text should be) to expect a text like Mentzer to be self-consistent and faithful to an understanding of the game that was not as current and clarified at the time as it is now. Rather, Mentzer should, I think, generally be read as a haphazard mixture of challengeful and auteuristic ideas about conducting a game; this is very natural, as it is a set of texts that emerged specifically in the era when these competing ideas about the nature of roleplaying were experiencing a sea-change. Mentzer has plenty of good advice for conducting a neutrally refereed, challenge-oriented game, but it also has ideas that are loathsome in hindsight (for these purposes, that is).<br/><br/>In general I find Mentzer to be pretty well in accord with my own understanding of methodical purity, there are many places in the rules where the text is extremely explicit about the fundamental nature of old wargame-like D&amp;D. This is of course mostly true for the basic red box text; later parts in the series are increasingly limp-wristed about the whole idea, being as how they depict heights of leveling that are generally only achieved by groups that play for "fun" instead of fair challenge. Expert set, for example, is already depicting a context where character survival is a matter of course, the player character roster is essentially permanent, and everybody's in it "for the long haul"; the DM has become a complicit pawn of PC aggrandizement and so on.<br/><br/>As an example of what I mean, check out the "Most Important Rule" from the Mentzer red box, the first text in the series:<br/><br/><i>A Dungeon Master must not take sides. You will play the roles of the creatures encountered, but do so fairly, without favoring the monsters or the characters. Play the monsters as they would actually behave, at least as you imagine them.<br/><br/>The players are not fighting the DM! The characters may be fighting the monsters, but everyone is playing the game to have fun. The players have fun exploring and earning more powerful characters, and the DM has fun playing the monsters and entertaining the players.<br/><br/>For example, it is not fair to change the rules unless everyone agrees to the change. When you add optional rules, apply them evenly to everyone, players and monsters. Do not make exceptions; stick to the rules, and be fair.</i><br/><br/>See? There's two facets to it, although I wouldn't characterize the basic text alone as too schizophrenic. While the actual point of this text is to emphasize the clear social contract of wargame-like D&amp;D (fair refereeing on the basis of mutually agreed-upon rules), already in this text we can see a crude characterization of the game's pay-off: Mentzer is describing "earning more powerful characters" as a key facet of the game's fun value. It's just a throw-away at this point, and nowhere in the red box does he really develop the theme, but it does exist from the start.<br/><br/>Thus, in summation: Mentzer is easy and profitable to play in a methodologically pure fashion, but it has bits of rules and advice that go against this strain of play. The earlier rules lean more towards pure wargaming D&amp;D, while the later material presumes a broken method with the DM coaching the party to "success". Expecting it to be otherwise would not be realistic, as Mentzer's overriding concern in writing these texts was importing the ideas and culture of gaming to his readers; he was not trying to impart a pure method, but rather simply what he saw and experienced around him. Naturally, at a time when this contradiction in the DM's role was strongly present in the actual living tradition, it would also make its way into a descriptive text like this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453881/#Comment_453881" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T11:44:17+00:00" title="June 16, 2016 11:44AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember that Mentzer was working from Moldvay which has pretty much the same non-kosher text with the same examples.\n<blockquote>Thus, in summation: Mentzer is easy and profitable to play in a methodologically pure fashion, but it has bits of rules and advice that go against this strain of play.

If one reads rpg discourse from the era (we're talking early '80s here, particularly), there is a strong sense of excitement involved in the birth of what we've come to know as the "traditional" style of play: GMs all over were stepping forward from what D&amp;D (and wargaming in general) prescribed as the agenda and method of play, and reinvented the artform. The future of roleplaying would be about storytelling, drama and passion, it would be a vehicle for the imagination - the GM's imagination - to entertain and educate. No longer wargaming, but rather something more.<br/><br/>To achieve this, one has to get rid of certain elements of the game's history; in hindsight it's pretty obvious how the doctrine of cheating (that the GM is responsible for the outcomes of play, and thus has the duty to cheat on the dice, that is) is an attempt at achieving the new vision via a backdoor route, without having to engage the play group as a whole in reinventing the hobby. Bad idea, but the zeitgeist was what it was: roleplaying (and D&amp;D in particular!) is an unitary single hobby (corollary: there is a single right way to play), and the GM is the supreme authority of his own vision (corollary: he does not need active cooperation from his constituency). These two stupid ideas (it is easy to say in hindsight), once internalized, make it very sensible to play a duplicitous game where the GM changes his refereeing process and method without making any overt changes to the player-facing rules procedures. The game changes, yet remains the same.<br/><br/>I don't personally quite get over the stupidity involved in not just designing a new, exciting game developed from the ground up to suit a vision like say Dragonlance, but given that this was evidently not an option, I can sort of understand the creative excitement that was present in pushing the higher ideals of plot and theme wherever it was possible. The technical outcome is a maddening muddle that people still struggle with (e.g. Pathfinder makes no more sense than AD&amp;D or that particular section of Mentzer in this regard), but I think it's evident that there was genuine creative desire underlying the hamfisted effort.<br/><br/>(Alternate history hypothesis: What If <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> was delayed for say four years more, Gygax got sidelined from its development, and what would finally come out in the mid-'80s would be an unholy spawn of D&amp;D and <i>Saga System</i>, intended to become the flagship game of the new story-oriented gaming era, distinct from the wargame-like Basic D&amp;D? Would it be possible to run two different D&amp;D lines with explicitly different creative agendas, considering how this already became a bit of a practical reality in our timeline? Would the name of the game still be "Advanced", or would it be preferable to call it "Legends of Dungeons &amp; Dragons" or something like that? Which would be more popular, the storygame or the wargame?)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453885/#Comment_453885" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T13:47:40+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  1:47PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a theory that the DMs that originally started doing the "curated experience" were considered good and popular for a while, and then they started teaching their experience so the original mode, which they were building on, fell away. That's why many the 90:s RPG were such messes.<br/><br/>I've spoke earlier how Drakar och Demoner 1991 edition removes all the world building help (random tables and such) from the earlier editions but instead put in things like "make it a roller coaster", "don't use the rules", "make it feel like a movie" etc. And I'm like... make <i>what</i> feel like a movie? You've removed all normal game mastering. The "popular" method for a few months there in the late 70:s/early 80:s was system + a dash of illusion/fudging/curation/quantum ogres and stuff. (A dash that I think you and I agree can spoil the whole broth, but that's a very strict position to suit our systematic, in my case definitely ASD-influenced, dispositions.)<br/><br/>But what happened was that the system part fell away and it became illusion <i>all the way down</i>. People pretending to play a game that they weren't playing. It's absurd.<br/>It's like when a little kid plays pretend at the chess board and just put the pieces down haphazardly and goes like "Oh this is check mate! I win, mommy!"<br/><br/>And if you want to make up stories, that's <i>great</i> and there are many <i>amazing</i> games for you these days that are based on that assumption.<br/>We now have the story games movement producing games that can sometimes make amazing, good experiences. (There's a lot of cargo cult games that are just meh, but Sturgeon's law applies and there are some great experience to be had here!) And we have the OSR trying to figure out ways RPGs can sing in a completely different way. It's the best of times, with these two fruitful strains.<br/><br/>It's just that... for a while, we were settled with these awful games like the aforementioned DoD91.<br/>On the player side, super complex Runequest ripoff with character build points, weird custom fighting techniques sub systems, hit points per body part, flow charts for combat, a long table to reference when resolving skills etc.<br/>On the DM side, illusionism, "don't bother learning any of the rules", just describe things in an engaging and clear way, make up what happens, make fake die rolls, think action and epicness...<br/>The game as a whole, the core goings-on of RPGs very poorly explained or understood. How are you talking around the table, when are dice rolls made, what are the consequences of the rolls etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453886/#Comment_453886" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T13:51:00+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  1:51PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So given that, I would actually kinda prefer a "Legends of Dungeons &amp; Dragons" that looked something like Microscope or Dungeon World or whatever, to what we got which was one of the most difficult-to-railroad games ever (Pathfinder with all its detailed rules and resolutions) used most popularly for just that, railroads.

I would even say those words understate things. The wilderness rules can match up PCs with monster encounters of such level disparity that they have almost no chance of survival, moreso if a few (un)lucky rolls throw multiple, un-escapable encounters at a group in the same day. If you've grown used to the tactical survival options available to, say, 3rd and 4th level characters as opposed to level 1s in the dungeon, and then those poor level 1 odds get reintroduced, it can leave a pretty bad taste in your mouth. Especially when the character you've been playing for the previous 6 months gets 1-shotted by some meaningless rando.<br/><br/>The problem lies more in the random generation system producing uninteresting results, from the perspective of player engagement, and the DM having to exercise a fair amount of oversight.

I play that part of the game straight (well, not by any of the written texts, but spiritually it's the same), and for me the idea of meaningless death in the back of beyond works just fine, and the better if we're killing off a liked character. It's the salt of the thing, one might say even the entire point of the exercise, to celebrate our willingness to kill off even the most beloved characters when the game tells us to. Sort of hypnotic, the relationship between the game procedure and the players, as we witness in fascinated horror as all the well-made plans and cherished fictive bits (PCs, henchmen, pets, families, castles, countries, gods) get ravaged by the randomness.<br/><br/>Reminds me of when our campaign did its very first cross-dimensional journey, and epic quest for a few unlikely heroes to save a world from peril. I'd prepped a massive amount of material for it, easily sufficient for a hundred sessions of play if it came to that. First thing, before even reaching a human settlement in the new world, the party encountered one of those "1-100" orc patrol encounters the monster manual advocates. Needless to say, no party of any reasonable level will survive an encounter with 87 orcs <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So yeah, it's thoroughly a matter of taste, of purpose - what we are even doing here, playing the game. I completely endorse the idea that if you're stuck with the D&amp;D rules chassis, yet nevertheless don't want meaningless death, it makes sense to get into this weird muddle of situational cheating and fudging and background orchestration. Moldvay and Mentzer are not being stupid with this advice, they're just not very organized about explaining the different ways and reasons to play the game. Had they explained that there are two ways to play D&amp;D, depending on whether you value fair play or planned plots more, and then proceeded to give situational advice, I wouldn't really have much to complain about with something like this.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I got to wondering, and maybe somebody with the Moldvay rules text can tell me: did Mentzer just lift that piece about cheating on the dice from the Moldvay text, or do the two texts clearly have origins in separate experiences? This came to me because of the way Mentzer worked at the time, with the earlier texts at hand, and his imprimatur to write a cleaner new edition of the game. I would not be surprised at all if that particular piece of advice went straight from Moldvay to Mentzer with no critical thought in between, simply as a matter of copying and pasting stuff from the old Expert rules to the new. After all, good DMing is good DMing, right, so of course the advice would be the same for both...<br/><br/>Not that the text in question is somehow antithetical to Mentzer the man himself; I understand that he pulls his punches as a DM, exactly in the way he advocates in the text: because it would be sad for a cherished character to die, let's not go there unless we have a good reason, as decided by me the DM. (This is, I understand, why he can simultaneously advocate both fair play and cheating, in case that wasn't clear from the rules text: you let the dice fall as they may as long as the PCs are low-level and not particularly interesting, but once somebody commits real emotion to something, you start treating it special, in the interest of everybody enjoying themselves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453892/#Comment_453892" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T15:36:46+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  3:36PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Having played a fair amount of wilderness-heavy D&amp;D (with the DM using primarily 1e AD&amp;D rules, but with B/X stat mods and 3d6-in-order), I can understand completely why someone would write those words into a rulebook. I would even say those words understate things. The wilderness rules can match up PCs with monster encounters of such level disparity that they have almost no chance of survival, moreso if a few (un)lucky rolls throw multiple, un-escapable encounters at a group in the same day.

Like, rolling the random encounter table, then having the scout or all the players roll perception and inmediatly next having everyone roll initiative is for me the worst approach ever and the only one that justifies using balanced encounters.<br/><br/>Fiction-wise it makes sense that players find what makes sense for the setting most of the time. Sure, you might find a group of 3 goblins at fist level, but there's also the chance to find a dragon at the same level. The thing is that players should never have to confront things directly without previous signals.<br/><br/>Like, you rolled goblins on the random table? Then the first encounter means you find the traces of those goblins. Either a totem made up from corpses marking their territory or rests of a burnt wagon that still has small arrows sticking on it, it can be a survivor from the attack or plain tracks in the mud that reveal their presence in the area. It doesn't mean the goblins can't set an ambush, but it does mean that players can still choose to take another path to avoid risking a next encounter with them.<br/><br/>It's the same for the dragon; 5e monster manual even lists a lot of signs of the presence of a dragon lair in the zone. You could definitely spot the dragon flying at some point if you remain in the area for too long. So now that you know what kind of things you can encounter there, it's up to you to risk a TPK or wait a few levels before facing this challenge. As long as the GM is clear enough about the level of the threat ahead (mostly, if the PCs could handle or not) players will often take the hints and play safe (as long as you have agreed before the game how things will work and give them more than a single hint before the encounter.<br/><br/>On top of that all this helps to build expectative, so it doesn't matter if the players roll a couple criticals and wipe out a threat, you've already put them into suspense.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453894/#Comment_453894" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T17:16:07+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  5:16PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2016 5:19PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>"But I rolled it!"</b> A common mistake most DMs make is to rely too much on random die rolls.

It was the very first RPG I bought. I banged my head against it and against its even worse peers for several years, then got taught a very different way from a combination of Everway, SLUG and my own no-myth-ideas (I wasn't calling it no myth but the same ideas were later called "no myth" on the Forge). I played productively with this no myth / no rules impro for a few years but there were some pitfalls so I wanted to learn "real" roleplaying so I went back to banging my head against the 90:s games until finally I read the old D&amp;D and I was like... "OH!! So <i>this</i> is what I was looking so desperately for all this time!" There are things in Basic that the 90:s games just take for granted that you know (and they riff against that, change it, fudge it, quantum ogre it, but they <i>start from it</i>, and that was the part that I didn't get).

In other words, players playing this game were supposed to be down for exactly what you don't want to happen - they might be disappointed but would trust in your judgment, you being real cool and all, and if you killed the character, they might be grouchy at losing their character, but they would say "yep, 2097 handled it right, good game everyone."<br/><br/>I think the overwhelming success of D&amp;D somewhat undermined this assumption (at least in America), though. A lot of times players were not okay with this, and there were often no other realistic options given D&amp;D's absolute dominance and the lack of technologies that let players seek out other groups engaging other options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453913/#Comment_453913" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T02:36:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  2:36AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Johnstone.  Dumb encounter tables are dumb, and there's no need to feel bound to them.  "Rocks fall, everybody dies" on the encounter chart has zero to do with challenge.  <br/><br/>Now, contextually, those 12 HD monsters might not be "rocks fall, everybody dies" -- depends on if there were any clues that might be coming, any way to avoid the encounter, etc.  It really depends on <i>how the DM interprets the 'encounter' result</i>, as the last few posts have worked at.  But I've certainly seen it played where tough random encounters were just basically "rocks fall," and clearly some folks not only are fine with it but think that anything else is weak sauce.     <br/><br/>Frankly, I think this whole issue speaks to the stupidity of those encounter charts more than anything else.  I started ignoring them before I was even out of junior high.  Clearly the module authors weren't rolling 10d10 for every encounter with orcs -- why would I?  I mean, there wouldn't be <b>any</b> wilderness encounters appropriate for a first level party.  <br/><br/>It's really a shame that there weren't better encounter charts in the early books.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453914/#Comment_453914" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T02:48:55+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  2:48AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually the encounter charts are sort of an interesting anomaly when you think about them in the context of the rest of the line.

The areas right around the town in the lower lefthand corner were average level 1-2; things went up as you got further away from the town, until you were hitting random encounters meant for level 6+ parties at the furthest fringes.<br/><br/>Just old school dungeons have a "danger gradient" that increases as you go downwards, Blueberry Bay has a gradient that gets scarier as you travel further afield... and a reward gradient that increases in the same direction. This lets the players choose their level of risk and reward.<br/><br/>(We used a cool experience point system for that game... the party split an amount of EXP determined by the most distant, dangerous area that they explored. They then got 10% bonuses for a handful of things, like bringing back wondrous treasure, making new allies and enemies, surviving a hard battle, learning about the history of the region, or exploring a new location.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453919/#Comment_453919" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T04:23:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  4:23AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Man, this is why I wanted rules in the first place, to add danger but not make it so that I, the DM, was the killer.

I want random tables to either a) produce interesting encounters, whether that's from an aesthetic or tactical perspective, or b) describe a setting that feels real and alive but is also somewhere the players want to explore. And a key part of both of those is setting the dangerousness of the encounter and the area as part of the game, and not as a GM decision. Which also requires, I think, communicating the level of danger to the players before they dive head first into it.<br/><br/>Like, the West Marches setup is absolutely preferrable, when you can identify which areas are more dangerous and make calculated decisions about how much risk you want to take on. If the only way you can determine the dangerousness of an area is with a 50 percent risk of a TPK, that's not real interesting if you're running characters you've got a lot of investment in. For dudes you just rolled up 5 minutes ago? Sure, that's fine. But if you have to start every new character at Level 1, wilderness encounters run exactly by the rules kind of suck. And maybe that's the point of splitting up the books, I guess? If you're going to play a wilderness-centric game, you should start PCs at Level 4, because Levels 1-3 in the Basic book are for dungeoncrawling only? I dunno.<br/><br/>Personally, I like the first 5 levels the best. When you get 50+ hp monsters, things tend to slow down, but if you speed it up with things that increase damage output, it just makes lower-level characters functionally useless. And then you end up with that WotC thing where the difference between Level 1, 10, and 20 is mostly aesthetic, because the difficulty of everything has been scaled up accordingly, and you only really notice the disparity when you match up things of wildly different levels. I don't find that particularly compelling either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453921/#Comment_453921" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T04:51:58+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  4:51AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2016 5:00AM by Lee_Short.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another +1 for Johnstone.  <br/><br/>The great thing about West Marches-esque, is that it relies on skilled play for the players to make the determination of what the danger level is.

Then roll for encounter distance and place the wandering monsters in a reasonable location based on distance and terrain features. Maybe roll for direction if you want, too. You can use those features to help determine what the situation with the wandering monster is, and the PCs can try to use them for advantage (climb the big tree, shoot a few arrows at the wolf-things, wait for them to leave or get chased off by a bear, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453927/#Comment_453927" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T08:24:57+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  8:24AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a great idea; I play verbal-only so instead of a map, I'd put in some "aspects" like "Big trees are here" etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453971/#Comment_453971" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-20T07:39:04+00:00" title="June 20, 2016  7:39AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking about this idea, so I wrote up some quick tables for my own use.

Does it require parkour?<br/><br/>Weird stuff: roaming fires, magic mouth in the ground, grasping arms that stick out of the ground, quicksand, geysers of steam and boiling water (or fire and acid), a vortex, a magic portal, a mirror that reflects magical attacks, a monolith that absorbs magic effects.<br/><br/>I think I work best with a weird image in mind first, then I come up with an effect for it after. If I start with an effect, sometimes I'll think up stuff that doesn't fit the scene (I can still save them for later, though).<br/><br/>For thinking up improvised weapons and other items lying around (including treasure) I find it useful to write out different professions and list what their tools are like, what sort of stuff they would have. Like, barber-surgeons have bandages, combs, files, flint and tinder, glass cups, oil, ointment, pliers, scalpels, scissors, and towels, and that's just stuff they might carry around. Also good for when players want to buy tool kits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453975/#Comment_453975" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-20T09:56:38+00:00" title="June 20, 2016  9:56AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We went into a bit of a flop last Friday when they were fighting a vampire using the many long splinters and shards of wood that they've found, I was like, yes, this is awesome, continue, yes!

Like, ok, you roll once for the dragon, the party gets some foresight, perhaps they see the dragon flying west. So unless the players still head west after that, they shouldn't find the same dragon. Re-roll and keep going. Of course, I'm thinking on a setting where dragons don't live in clusters and instead have their dens far away from each other.<br/><br/>If players see a dragon flying west, they can easily choose to take a detour or go east to avoid the dragon lair, and no random roll should take that away from them without giving them a good excuse. If they head east and roll another dragon, the GM should either ask for a re-roll or introduce another dragon heading east, or perhaps introduce something else related to the dragon. Perhaps it's going back to it's lair after attacking the town that players get to find on their way to the east on their second dragon roll.<br/><br/>However you interpretate that roll, If it was me I'd keep immersion and common sense in first place, and sensibility towards player's frustation second. As a GM I'll consider my work a complete failure if such a random encounter would mean me telling the players to roll for new characters. I'm okay if bad stuff happens because the dice say so, but as a GM it's my duty to make even bad stuff interesting and amusing. Totally blocking the players intentions and not giving them any other choice than creating new characters to continue the game isn't only unfair, it's plain boring.<br/><br/>So, besides framing random encounters like traces the players need to follow to turn them into actual encounters, I could also change the nature of the encounter. Rolling a dragon could mean many different interesting things. Why can't it be a good dragon? What if the dragon is up for a fight but prefers to fight more experienced adventurers? what if it tries terrorizing them and asking for a bribe just for fun? what if it prefers an intellectual challenge instead of a fight? how about giving them a quest to advance it's personal agenda? <br/><br/>Well, I dunno, random tables are great, but it bores the heck out of me to just roll on them and thrown whatever comes up at the players when they are on their way to another scene. Specially when something unfair happens. No result of any random table should be used as an excuse to bring boring/frustrating things into the game. If that never happens when you roll on a random table, you're doing it fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454110/#Comment_454110" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T13:33:33+00:00" title="June 23, 2016  1:33PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding Eero's early post in this thread, I wonder if any text has made it explicit that a GM's job is to "coach" players to success?<br/><br/>I'd never thought about it in those terms, but damn if that doesn't describe a fair bit of actual play culture for many rpgs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_454180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454180/#Comment_454180" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T20:28:27+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  8:28PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've heard lots of folks suggest that that 87 orcs result is that the players can spot an orc encampment in the distance.

With proper tables and clever GMing, you can introduce a good deal of variety, as well. If I'm running this kind of game and I've decided (or rolled) that a certain area is extremely dangerous, I'll do my best to think up some signs or consequences which the players could discover. Maybe they're obvious (skeletons litter the landscape!) or maybe they require some research to uncover (local myths and legends?), but, either way, it can serve that game goal pretty well, I think.<br/><br/>To those who are interested in the (I believe, excellent-) idea that random encounters should not necessarily lead to a direct confrontation, I would encourage that you look into two different things:<br/><br/>1. I believe most D&amp;D manuals (although maybe not all) list "disposition" and Morale for monsters encountered. I seem to remember that a lot of these were relatively friendly, not overtly hostile, and a Reaction roll would further affect the outcome. Befriending or negotiating with monsters encountered was, in my conception of the game, at least, a common outcome. I have a feeling people sometimes ignore this kind of thing and try to jump straight to a fight!<br/><br/>2.

And what I've found is giving players greater control over risks makes them more likely to take them. For example, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A" rel="nofollow">the X Card</a> tends to make people more comfortable and likely to engage in the elements they find difficult than they otherwise would.

An environment that the DM is adjudicating, but not one the DM, or the players, or both together, is/are creating on the fly.</blockquote>\nThe old school aesthetic also doesn't concern itself with clearly communicating the level of danger to the players, and this still doesn't answer my question beyond 'that's just how it's done'.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454326/#Comment_454326" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T12:21:46+00:00" title="June 29, 2016 12:21PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a part of the experience that doesn't work great at the moment so I'm going to, in line with much of what Johnstone, Paul and others are saying, think about it when I write the next encounter tables.<br/>For example, put in there: 3d6 wolves at 120 feet.<br/>Or. 1d12 blood-apes, they ambush you.

I was part of what some people clearly consider "old school" D&amp;D  (Mentzer Basic set was my starting point) and we never played that way.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not a big fan of the encounter table idea;  I think how the encounter starts should be dependent on the fiction.  3d6 wolves at 120' in dense forest is nonsense - the party won't even be aware of them at that point, whereas 3d6 wolves at 120' on the plains is a case of "WTF, why didn't we notice them when they were further away?"   That's okay, you say, I'll write different encounter tables for the woods and the plains. So what happens if it rains?  What if it's dark?  I think a lot of these results will necessarily lead to "roll a perception check" for how bad the situation is going to be, and no, there aren't hard guidelines for that either, but if you're gonna be all "old school", you need to stop trying to disclaim responsibility, because that is incompatible with "rulings, not rules."                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454343/#Comment_454343" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T19:16:53+00:00" title="June 29, 2016  7:16PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2016 7:23PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, I'm not married to the name old school.

I feel like I read a lot of your posts and your first instinct always seems to be to change something to compensate for your perceived shortcomings instead of trying to overcome them.  You can't avoid making life-or-death decisions as the GM.  It's not a thing you can do.  So it may be in your best interests to try to come to grips with that, instead of trying to avoid it whenever possible.\n<blockquote><br/>And us having some sorta discussion about how far away they are, that isn't working too hot.

What I am saying is that I believe it is functionally impossible to do this everywhere, and that this is an area where I feel it's not a good idea to try.  If it were possible to do this everywhere, we wouldn't need GMs.  The whole reason we have a GM is that sometimes decisions - even "life or death for the PCs" kind of decisions - need to be made in a non-programmatical way. Rulings, not rules, etc, etc.\n<blockquote><br/>You often see me arguing strongly in favor of fiction first. But here is an area where that hasn't worked out, because I don't really have an intuitive feel for inches and feet and miles (being non-American), </blockquote>\nIs the implication that you'd be better at centimeters, meters and kilometers?  I think most people suck at distances, but that probably also includes your players, so they probably  notice less than you think.\n<blockquote><br/>because I don't really have an intuitive feel for visibility and audibility in the wilderness, and because it's an area where it's very very directly connected to life and death for the party.</blockquote>\nAgain; It is impossible to avoid making decisions that are very very directly connected to life and death for the party.  You don't roll randomly to see who monsters attack, do you?\n<blockquote><br/>Actually I also want to know how setting up camp in the wilderness works [in the game, I'm not planning on going camping for real]:<br/>What equipment do the party need?

A fire might deter some types of enemies (wolves) while attracting others (Giant moths? Bandits?)  How long does it take?  How rocky is the ground? Did it rain yesterday?  How warm or cold is it? <br/><br/>This strikes me as a place where it is best NOT to engage at all, because the party is made up of experienced adventurers who know how to make a camp (or maybe not, but...) and how to stay warm in the wilderness, whereas your table is probably not made up of people with these skills.   So much like you not trying to figure out how the paladin gets into his full plate every morning, you are probably best off going with an intent-and-results style model here and not getting bogged down in the details since you don't know the consequences of those details anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

I just think that you can't do this for everything.  See earlier comments about why we need a GM.\n<blockquote><br/>That is precisely why I want to codify it.

It's easy to build a system that makes sense when you know that "X leads to Y" but if you don't know that, how do you codify it?  And that's setting aside all the questions that I really want to ask, but assume you already have along the lines of "Is this really something we want to spend time on in play?" Is there ever a situation in which a PC who has a bedroll would not use it?  And if there is, is this a decision that the player should need to make?  "It's hot tonight, and you feel uncomfortable in your bedroll, do you throw off the blankets?" is not a question that I would ever want to ask my players, but it seems to be exactly where you are going.  I'm just going to assume that this is a question you want to ask your players and move on.\n<blockquote><br/>Airk, the last time we were arguing I quit S-G for ten months!

The characters, and thus the players, don't bring anything to the game except action and the act of discovering what the DM has kept secret. According to this game, the DM either creates or purchases a setting (module), or uses random tables to create, in their mind, a setting and situation, and then presents it to the players (even if that occurs in the span of seconds).<br/><br/>You can play that particular game if nobody shows up with characters. But you can't play that particular game if nobody shows up with a setting or the tables with which to create one.<br/><br/>It's totally cool to not like that game, not play that game, not like how one, some, or all of those authors presented the game, or like half the game but want half of it to be different. It's totally cool to drift that game -- people have, people are, people will.<br/><br/>But if people are playing that game, it's presumably for one of 2 reasons: a) that's the experience they want, or b) they don't have the opportunity to play a game that suits them better.<br/><br/>So, from that perspective I do not agree that more player input into the setting is a fix to a problem with the game itself.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, let me back up on that for a second, because perhaps I have misunderstood. I think if the DM has a sandbox setting with dungeons or areas of differing levels, it is perfectly in line with the core philosophy and game play to just say "this place is for Level 2 characters" or "this is a low-level dungeon." And if the players get together and say "our PCs are level 3 and 4, but theres 7 of us today, so we'd like to try a Level 5 dungeon" it's cool for the DM to point out where on the map a Level 5 or similar dungeon is so they can go there.<br/><br/>That seems like a perfectly reasonable way of communicating the danger level of areas, for people who don't mind it being meta and not in-fiction details.<br/><br/>If that's the kind of thing you were suggesting, AnonAdderlan, then yes, I would agree that's a way to deal with in-fiction details not communicating the level of danger to the players very well, and I apologize if I came off as curt, snippy, or dismissive.<br/><br/>But once the players choose a place and begin interacting with the fiction, the DM's supposed to be impartial, and not increase or decrease the dangerousness (either by "going soft" in order to save PCs they like, being vindictive, not paying attention, etc). Players deciding the details of individual encounters goes against both the idea that they are discovering something that already exists, and the goal of impartiality once the livs of PCs is at stake.<br/><br/>Dungeon design, because it has levels, is pretty good at having discreet danger levels. Yeah, maybe you find out how deadly a dungeon is by getting a few PCs killed (which sucks when you have no more high-level guys and you then can't return to that dungeon), but wilderness games don't have those levels, and even though PCs of Level 4+ have way more opportunity to escape a situation that's over their heads than Level 1 PCs do, it's still kind of a crap-shoot. That works for Metamorphosis Alpha, maybe, (when you don't have any levels) but when you have levels on the players side but not on the DM's side, you're going to run into both the grind-for-nothing and the unfair TPK-from-nowhere.<br/><br/>Which is why I'm not surprised the game book says fudge things so that doesn't happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454351/#Comment_454351" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T21:04:34+00:00" title="June 29, 2016  9:04PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Cool!

It's easy to build a system that makes sense when you know that "X leads to Y" but if you don't know that, how do you codify it?  And that's setting aside all the questions that I really want to ask, but assume you already have along the lines of "Is this really something we want to spend time on in play?" Is there ever a situation in which a PC who has a bedroll would not use it?  And if there is, is this a decision that the player should need to make?  "It's hot tonight, and you feel uncomfortable in your bedroll, do you throw off the blankets?" is not a question that I would ever want to ask my players, but it seems to be exactly where you are going.

The DM rolls, sees the entry, envisions it in their mind (makes up reasons, etc) and presents it to the players. They invent the context in that moment, yeah, but the table and all the monsters on it are already prepared. That's not the same process as creating a dungeon or other map with everything on it, sure, but it's similar in that the DM is revealing it to the players after having prior knowledge of it.<br/><br/>That said, the further back in time you go, the fewer games you can find that do things other than what's there is early D&amp;D.

As a consequence the team at the time consisted of like maybe one 4th level Fighter and three or four 1st level nobodies. No henchmen, because they had <i>just</i> finished a planar journey to a different world, and hardly knew anybody there; I think one of the PCs was in fact a replacement from the start, as they lost one of the party members in the planar portal itself. No relevant magic items were involved, and the encounter became a quick and chaotic fight (as dictated by chance) almost immediately. As might be expected, the 4th level Fighter accounted for himself well, but could not convince the orcs to fall back immediately, and thus was forced to escape alone while leaving his companions to their fate.<br/><br/>Please do note that I did not intend to make any authoritative claims about by the book D&amp;D of any particular sort with that anecdote - it is entirely possible that an appropriately leveled team of adventurers in a given system <i>will</i> beat 87 orcs, even if it is pretty impossible in my home system without special circumstances and a good plan. The point I was demonstrating in the above discussion was my willingness to play the setting and the dice as they fall, even when the outcome is a harsh, immediate crisis situation through no fault of the party. Contrary to the advice of Cook and Mentzer, that is, rather than fudging the rules to save the party.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454801/#Comment_454801" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T13:53:58+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  1:53PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 5:27PM by Airk.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>You don't roll randomly to see who monsters attack, do you?</blockquote>\nI used to do this, yes. But one of the players asked me to instead do the attacks which would be the most hurtful towards towards the party so I've been doing that for a while. That player is away for the summer and one of the other players asked me "Have them attack the person it makes sense for them to attack" and that's much trickier.</blockquote>\nSee, I would consider this to be a place where doing anything other than the last choice would be detrimental to my gaming experience.   Maybe there are some monsters that it makes sense for them to randomly flail around, but I can't think of any off the top of my head - maybe something that's paniced and really just wants to get away but can't?  Even the most mindless of monsters seem like they would either attack the person who hit them last, attack the same person they attacked the last time (if possible), or attack the most wounded opponent.  Using some sort of random method would basically leave me thinking "What's wrong with this monster?" followed by "...why are you playing the monsters so dumb?" if/when the GM indicated that this was the default assumption.  Rolling randomly for who a monster attacks eliminates all kinds of tactics and diminishes the players' ability to interact with the game, because there is nothing they can do to influence that random die roll.<br/><br/>I struggle with reconciling the idea that you want consequences of something that is, to me, so trivial as camping situations, but would be unwilling to present vaguely realistic monster behavior.\n<blockquote>I don't think it's so inscrutable that I've noticed that I want some consistent (mechanical?) solution to "how far away are the monsters when we first see them in the wilderness" because I said that and asked for that.</blockquote>\nI think you've been fairly clear about that particular ask, but you seem very resistant to the idea that it's going to be extremely difficult model in any sort of reasonable way. \n<blockquote>\u2022 The closer / more direct things are to deciding the life or limb of the PCs, the more I want them decided by mechanics.</blockquote>\nWhile I can understand this objectively, it runs counter to my own preferences, because I think randomness tends to produce nonsensical results.   If my PC dies because the GM made a decision about the behavior of a monster and that decision makes any kind of sense, I'm okay with that.  If my PC dies because a random die roll decided that the monster would ignore a bunch of other characters and come over and hit my PC even though he has taken no aggressive actions, and my PC dies, I am going to be upset, because I feel like that outcome makes no sense and that my actions don't matter.\n<blockquote><br/>\u2022 The more things interact with mechanics the players have to use, the more I want them decided by mechanics. Like if the players are using a baking skill to win a baking contest vs some orc, I don't want to set the orc's baking skill then and there on the spot.</blockquote>\nI know this is a place where we disagree, but I feel like this is the wrong metric here.  It doesn't matter when the orc's skill is generated at all.  It's completely irrelevant except in how it relates to the metric that actually matters: That the orc's skill be determined in a way that makes sense - which should (at least in most styles of game) be independent of the skills of the PCs.   If you are inclined to base the orc's skill more on the PC's skill if you make it up in the moment, then yes, you want to prepare this in advance (if possible, which is a pretty big if).  But if you are capable of saying something like, "Well, this the Gr'lok, High Baker of Orgimir, so he's probably a damn fine baker by orcish standards.  Though I don't think orcs are renowned for their culinary arts, so that's probably just "above average" by human standards, so I'll give him \\whatever score the game system says is 'above average for human standards'\\" then it really makes zero difference if you went through this logical process last year, yesterday, when Gr'lok is introduced, or right before he makes his roll.  Because the result is the same in all those cases, and is flows logically from the fiction.<br/><br/>(Note: This is also a case where I view randomness as a poor choice, since the High Baker could end up with jokey levels of baking skill, or nonsensically high levels.  Or you could restrict the randomness to what you think a "reasonable" range is, but at that point, you're not really disclaiming decision making.) \n<blockquote><br/>I want the game to be like this living little bubble where the players can make real decisions and effect real change.</blockquote>\nI think this is the crux of my confusion here. I feel like you are undermining this goal by using random systems.<br/><br/>If you have a random table that says "3d6 wolves at 2d100 meters" you are denying the players the ability to influence the distance at which they notice those wolves.  You are reducing their ability to make real decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454805/#Comment_454805" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T15:36:29+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  3:36PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Food for thought for sure<br/><br/>To clarify, I no longer roll randomly for monster attacks, and when I did, and the DMs I've played with who do, it was randomly <em>between reasonable choices</em>, e.g. frontline fighters<br/><br/>By adding the distance to the wolves it's an improvement over how it is now, where they're just upon them immediately, which is worse,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454814/#Comment_454814" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T17:30:38+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  5:30PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 5:45PM by Airk.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even "reasonable choices" is still a very fraught decision if you are worried about those sorts of things, IMHO.\n<blockquote>By adding the distance to the wolves it's an improvement over how it is now, where they're just upon them immediately, which is worse,</blockquote>\nI don't think that's true.  Because I feel like the "They're just upon them immediately." is just your assumption about how an "encounter" works.<br/><br/>There's nothing there that says that, say, the PCs shouldn't be allowed to make perception checks, or that you shouldn't at least use passive perception to determine the distance at which the wolves are spotted.  Or pay attention to what precautions the PCs are taking.  All the game is <i>actually telling</i> you here is that there are wolves, and there are 3d6 of them.  Not "And they appear in melee range" or "They are upon the PCs in two rounds." but... "there are 3d6 wolves. Somewhere."<br/><br/>And this goes back to why automating this stuff is hard.  If the PCs are in a forest at night, the distances will need to be very different from a plain during the day. Unless of course the grass is really long, in which case that might be worse. And what if it's raining? Or there's fog? <br/><br/>Trying to put together a system that will give you a distance while factoring in terrain, weather, lighting, the abilities of the PCs, any special precautions that might have been taken, times however many different types of encounters (it's a lot easier for a moving party to wander into a bandit ambush than it is for those same bandits to sneak up on the PCs while they are camped.) times the number of different types of creatures involved just doesn't seem like it's a good payoff for the effort.  I'd say you're probably better off letting go of your assumptions about what the game is(n't) telling you, and using your best judgement. I know you don't have a lot of confidence in your judgement, but just because something is a mechanical system doesn't mean it actually produces good results.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454849/#Comment_454849" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T19:49:16+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  7:49PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think that's true.

Rolling randomly - at one extreme - produces ridiculous results. Rolling within a narrow range decided by the GM ("He'll attack either you or you - I'll flip a coin") is better, but now the GM's judgement is involved. Going with full GM judgement is sometimes better ("You're closest; of course he'll attack you!"), but removes some impartiality, or can be difficult for some GMs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you have to find a point on that spectrum which satisfies the necessary criteria. Something like:<br/><br/>* The GM feels comfortable making the call without making a biased choice.<br/>* The process for making the call is clear to the players.<br/>* The players trust that the GM is acting in a principled manner.<br/><br/>For instance, when I run random encounters, I simply pick what makes sense given the situation. If you're in an open field, I'm not going to make a horde of Giants appear five feet away! Then we settle important points of contention (like whether someone is spotted, or someone is surprised) using the appropriate mechanics. In other words, I imagine what a group approaching another group in this environment would be like, and play it out accordingly (in the dark, it's possible to "bump into each other" if the environment is loud; on the open seas you'll be guaranteed to spot each other a good distance away).<br/><br/>Other groups and other GMs may have a different "comfort area"!<br/><br/>However, I'm also surprised:<br/><br/>As far as I can remember, all the (older) versions of D&amp;D which include random encounters also <i>very explicitly</i> include the distance of the encounter for various environments. For example, it's different in the dungeon vs. in the forest vs. on an open plain. Like all such simplifications, it's not perfect, but it did the job pretty well for people playing those games, and "modern" OSR folks still use them.<br/><br/>I'm also fond of building those things into the random tables themselves, like the various "spoor" ideas we discussed at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454854/#Comment_454854" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T20:02:35+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  8:02PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Rolling within a narrow range decided by the GM ("He'll attack either you or you - I'll flip a coin") is better</blockquote>\nThat's what I used to do and some DMs still do.

No matter how much decision making you try to disclaim, it all comes back to your judgements.  You can interpose layers of system if you want, but at the end of the day, everything that happens an RPG is the result of the actions of the GM and/or the actions of the players.  <br/><br/>You can't solve this with a random table, even if you filled out everything I mentioned in the previous blob about all the factors you need. 3d6 wolves.  Do the wolves even care about the party?   Are they just chasing a moose and happen to come within sight?  Do they think the PCs are going to be dinner? Have they already made a kill and think the PCs are going to steal it?  Why are there wolves here?  You need to answer these questions to have an encounter.  These are decisions that need to be made by a person.  A random table can give you a start, but for the same reason that a random dungeon generator tends to produce a pretty awful dungeon unless you massage it a lot, a random "encounter" table produces bad "<a href="http://theangrygm.com/how-to-build-awesome-encounters/" rel="nofollow">encounters</a>".  I don't think it can provide you with the depth you need.<br/><br/>There is no "one size fits all" approach to GMing. Trying to expunge decision making as much as possible may have gotten you to a better GMing place than than where you started, but that doesn't necessarily mean that continuuing to do that will bring you to a better place than you are at now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454866/#Comment_454866" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T20:29:57+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  8:29PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am making decisions when I am making or selecting/importing mechanics. And then I set those mechanics loose and things happen. That's what I want, and have.<br/><br/>I don't want to make moment-to-moment decisions.<br/><br/>Here's an analogy. When we were kids and didn't understand how to fly a kite, we would run with the kit in our hands and pretend that it flied.<br/>When we learned how to get it to fly, the experience changed. It's different.<br/><br/>Now, running around with a kite in your hand, that's not worthless. It's fun, you can pretend it's a space ship or just that it is what it is and it's still fun to do, you have control or you can compartmentalize and let your subconscious guide the kite and discover things about yourself. It's actually a pretty fun thing even still to do. Sometimes I like... when I'm walking down a forest path, I make my hand into a little space ship shape and "fly" it around, no kite, no toy, just daydreaming about the crew of the "hand ship" flying through the woods.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>Having a kite up there, high in the air, trying to hold it with the line but trying to give and take. It's a very different experience. They can't replace each other.<br/><br/>And so it is with me and RPGs. I used to decide everything that happened. And it's interesting, similar to writing a novel in realtime, with input. A fun thing to do. Trying to compartmentalize, letting go, let the dream consciousness steer where we went, sometimes surprising me, just like the "holding the kite and running" daydreaming.<br/><br/>And now, I try to decide as little as possible. And the kite has taken off. It's nothing like writing a book. It's more like assembling these little wind up toys and throwing them all out on the table and see what happens. Or like flying a kite. Sometimes, you have to step in, make some judgement calls to keep the kite up there.<br/><br/>For example, last Tuesday one PC who had a horde of zombies he had tamed, he died and they ran wild. And I wrote that zombie horde in on the encounter table for that region. And the player said "Are you... are you allowed to do that?" and I said "Yes. I decide that this is what happens. Here" and I put it in there. "Now you can meet them again, but it won't be a sure thing."<br/><br/>Because it's not a board game, it's a refereed game. I know that. But. That referee power I like to reserve for special and weird situations.

Trying to expunge decision making as much as possible may have gotten you to a better GMing place than than where you started, but that doesn't necessarily mean that continuuing to do that will bring you to a better place than you are at now.</blockquote>\nWell said, Airk.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you have to choose your battles.<br/><br/>Old-school D&amp;D has a pretty good set of tools for this stuff, though, and the OSR community is always developing more. Some combination of random encounter with area-specific tables + randomized encounter distance + Reaction rolls + Morale checks does a pretty decent job for most people. I'd recommend doing some reading online to see other people's favourite tools - maybe some will inspire you!<br/><br/>For a personal example, I don't like "rolling randomly to see who the monster attacks", except in really rare instances where it could be anyone at all (e.g. a monster throwing a rock, blind, over a wall). I feel pretty comfortable just "roleplaying" the monsters. I don't find it hard to "firewall" important knowledge, I enjoy the game more if I get to "play", in this sense, I can pass a decision to a random roll when I *do* encounter of conflict of interests, and so forth. However, I started wondering whether I was playing some monsters "too intelligently". I added a couple of values to my "random monster generation" table which say "this monster is unusually intelligent", or "this/these monsters act in a disciplined and organized fashion in combat". That frees me to play most monsters rather "unintelligently", and then pull out the stops when I roll one of those. (In my last OSR-style game, I rolled up a group of humanoids who could communicate with each other telepathically and were organized in combat, so I had them develop all kinds of clever and time-sensitive plans against the PCs, which everyone enjoyed.)<br/><br/>As another example, Eero gets a lot of mileage out of his 50/50 mechanic. It's very simple: when he has to make a call about something, he comes up with the most obvious, middle-of-the-road ruling, and then rolls a die. On a 4-6, that's what it is. On a 1-3, that's not it, so he has to come up with something meaningfully different. Rinse and repeat; this means that most situations will be fairly straightforward, but occasionally really unusual things will happen.<br/><br/>I did this with my "intelligent telepathic" monster tribe. If the players started telling me about their battle plan, I would say, "Wait, wait! Hang on!" Then I would ask myself a couple of relevant questions: "Are the monsters feeling aggressive, or scared?" "Will they try to surprise the PCs or retreat to a fortified position?" I would roll dice for each one. Pretty quickly I'd have enough information to know what the monsters were up to, and then I'd be ready to hear the PCs' plan and tell them where it encountered the enemy. The players trusted my judgement on this kind of thing, and we all enjoyed the game a great deal as a result.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454870/#Comment_454870" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T20:40:22+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  8:40PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 8:47PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a bit of straw doll going on here because a lot of decisions you make in your examples, I do make them too.<br/><br/>My core philosophy is: the fewer decisions I do <i>in play</i> as DM, the happier I am ("in play", as opposed to in prep / between sessions).<br/>And you're coming from a different direction maybe.

I think I see the problem! This is a mistake I often do in conversations and I think I did it again:\n<blockquote>And I feel like I have presented good reasons</blockquote>\nI forgot to acknowledge / validate your reasons.<br/>I disagree with them! I do.<br/>But I didn't even respond to them. And that was a mistake, that's why you're feeling stonewalled and you're right, I've got to do better. Here's another try:\n<blockquote>Do the wolves even care about the party? Are they just chasing a moose and happen to come within sight? Do they think the PCs are going to be dinner? Have they already made a kill and think the PCs are going to steal it? Why are there wolves here?</blockquote>\nThese questions I don't have a problem with. I'm using a mix of mechanics, systems, and, yes, decision-making that have so far worked well. What I want to codify is distance and detection. Those two things. Because that hasn't worked well. So, I dismissed this reason b/c I felt it was straw doll or orthogonal to the issue I specifically wanted to codify / disclam / mechanize.\n<blockquote>While I can understand this objectively, it runs counter to my own preferences, because I think randomness tends to produce nonsensical results. If my PC dies because the GM made a decision about the behavior of a monster and that decision makes any kind of sense, I'm okay with that. If my PC dies because a random die roll decided that the monster would ignore a bunch of other characters and come over and hit my PC even though he has taken no aggressive actions, and my PC dies, I am going to be upset, because I feel like that outcome makes no sense and that my actions don't matter. </blockquote>\nAnd this is a preference, not a reason. I feel differently and I've explained why/how I feel differently.\n<blockquote>If you are inclined to base the orc's skill more on the PC's skill if you make it up in the moment, then yes, you want to prepare this in advance (if possible, which is a pretty big if).</blockquote>\nYes, I can easily prepare this in advance by having, like Paul suggest, a <i>system</i> for giving me orc's baking skills based on some other factors. <i>Everyone</i> is statted up.\n<blockquote>But if you are capable of saying something like, "Well, this the Gr'lok, High Baker of Orgimir, so he's probably a damn fine baker by orcish standards.</blockquote>\nEverytime I bring up this example of the orc's baking skill, someone brings this up, they're the High Baker or they're the worst baker or they're the ordinary village orc baker or they're the orcish frontline soldier baker or... or... the <i>point</i> of the example is that it's something<br/>\u2022 <i>unexpected</i><br/>\u2022 <i>unusual</i><br/>\u2022 <i>could easily be high or low</i><br/><br/>That's why it's a good systems test. Like, can your NPC generation system handle an <i>unexpected</i> baking contest with a very peripheral NPC without you having to make a judgement call? If yes, then it can handle the "orcish baker". That's the point of the example.<br/><br/>In the example, you don't <b>know</b> if it's the high or low baker from the positioning, you have to have the skill value somehow. Like, how would FAE handle it? It'd just be an approach. And how would 5e handle it? An ability check. So. Those systems can handle it easy. Just put in "The 3d12 orcs in this village all use <b>commoner</b> stats unless otherwise specified" and you have solved the "orcish baker" riddle because the commoner statblock has a way to roll for how good the cake is, built in.<br/><br/>Similarly, ACKS has a more complicated way of solving it by looking at the village size and rolling on a table to see how good the best bakers are etc etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454884/#Comment_454884" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T21:57:39+00:00" title="July  8, 2016  9:57PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could try a qualitative chart instead of a quantitative chart (as I did with my harm hack):<br/><br/>Roll 2d6<br/><br/>The encountered monsters/others are...<br/><br/>2-3 Very surprisingly and unexpectedly close, catching you off guard!<br/>4-5 Quite close; they got closer to you than you'd normally expect<br/>6-8 At a reasonable distance, as you'd expect based on the terrain<br/>9-10 You were alert, and you see them a ways off.<br/>11-12 You can spot them indirectly, before you even encounter them.<br/><br/>You could include whatever other issues you consider important, like, "On an odd roll, they were aware of you before you realized they were there."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454886/#Comment_454886" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T22:00:15+00:00" title="July  8, 2016 10:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2016 10:01PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to go with something that gives me a feet distance.<br/><br/>Well, like a feet distance from where they are <i>when the encounter is rolled</i>, not when they spot it.<br/>So there can be further sneaking and positioning going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454887/#Comment_454887" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T22:08:50+00:00" title="July  8, 2016 10:08PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Determining the distance of the encounter *before* it's, uh, encountered, is a great idea!

I randomly determine a direction with a d8 roll.<br/><br/>Then I take weather into account (I roll for weather once per day). If it's foggy or rainy, for example, I reduce the encounter distance a little.<br/><br/>Then, depending on which watch it is, I determine whether it's dark out. If so, I reduce the encounter distance even more, except this component can be decreased or nullified depending on the party's strongest light source (if any) and if anyone in the party has darkvision. If it's night and the encounter creatures have light sources (torches, lanterns), I increase the encounter distance, since it's much easier to see light sources from afar in the dark.<br/><br/>Then I modify for the party's pace. If they're at a fast pace, the encounter distance is decreased, for example. Then I increase the encounter distance if the encounter creatures are loud, or reduce it if they're atypically quiet.Then I modify for elevation. If the party is higher up than the encounter creatures, the encounter distance is increased.<br/><br/>The specific values are something I'm still experimenting with. Again, I would never bother trying to account for all of these variables without the luxury of the computer taking a few inputs then automatically doing all the rolling and referencing for me and then spitting out a succinct summary.<br/><br/>Now, at each of these steps, I have a noticeability value which ticks up and down by a few points. If it's at night and the party has a torch, for example, I add +2 to this noticeability value. If it's foggy or heavily raining, I reduce it. Fast pace ups it. Slow pace decreases it. This noticeability ends up being a modifier for the encounter creatures' perception checks.<br/><br/>Once I have the results, which is an encounter distance value in feet and a noticeability value. I have my players roll Perception (they love to roll, and it takes about 10 seconds). I take the highest Perception result of the party, subtract 10, then multiply by 5 and add it to the encounter distance. That's the distance at which the party will notice the encounter creatures. A higher perception means the party notices the encounter creatures from further away and therefore has more time to decide what to do. <br/><br/>I take the encounter distance (before its been modified by the party's Perception) and modify it similarly with the highest Perception among the encounter creatures, but I first add that noticeability value as a modifier. If the PCs have the higher encounter distance, they notice the encounter creatures first.<br/><br/>I know that's a lot going on for a random encounter, but the resolution of all of this goes very quickly in practice via the virtual tabletop. So far I like it alright, but feel like the noticeability bit is a little hacky and inelegant. I've thought about running the encounter distance script twice, once for the party and once for the encounter creatures, to determine who notices who first, and at what distance. <br/></blockquote>\nFrom <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?750303-Any-Edition-Encounter-Distance" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454897/#Comment_454897" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T22:44:31+00:00" title="July  8, 2016 10:44PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And this is (apparently; I didn't retrieve it myself) from the 3.0 SRD:\n<blockquote><br/><br/>ENCOUNTERS<br/><br/>When an encounter between the PCs and an NPC or creature is<br/>imminent, follow these steps:<br/><br/>1. Determine vision conditions and terrain. Choose from the <br/>choices on Table: Spotting Distance.<br/>2. If line of sight or illumination defines the distance at which the <br/>encounter occurs (as often happens indoors), start the encounter <br/>there. Otherwise, roll for spotting distance on Table: Spotting <br/>Distance.<br/>3. All creatures involved make Spot checks. Success means that <br/>creature sees the other creature or group. See Table: Spotting <br/>Difficulty for modifiers on these checks.<br/>4. If neither side succeeds, all creatures spot each other at one-<br/>half the rolled range.<br/><br/>The circumstances that can affect the DC of a Spot check are as <br/>follows:<br/><br/>Size: Add +4 to the base DC of 20 for each size category the <br/>creature being spotted is smaller than Medium-size or -4 for each<br/>size category larger. You can make exceptions for creatures with <br/>unusual shapes, such as a Large snake that's low to the ground <br/>and thus as hard to see as a Small creature.<br/><br/>Contrast: How starkly the creature's coloring stands out against <br/>the surroundings. It's easy to spot a brightly colored couatl in a <br/>dark jungle and hard to see winter wolves in the snow.<br/><br/>Stillness: It's harder to see creatures that are not moving.<br/><br/>Six or More Creatures: Groups of creatures are easier to spot, <br/>even if the creatures are smaller than Medium-size.<br/><br/>Moonlight: Nighttime, but with moonlight (or similar light).<br/><br/>Starlight: Nighttime with no moon but a clear, starry sky (or <br/>similar light).<br/><br/>Total Darkness: Overcast at night, or otherwise lightless.<br/><br/>Hiding and Spotting<br/><br/>If creatures are trying not to be seen, it's usually harder to spot <br/>them, but creatures that are keeping low to avoid being spotted <br/>also are less likely to notice other creatures.<br/><br/>If creatures are hiding, they can only move at half their normal <br/>overland speed. They also suffer a -2 penalty on their Spot <br/>checks to notice other creatures because they are staying low.<br/><br/>Instead of a base DC of 20 for others to spot them at the <br/>standard spotting distance, the DC is 25 + the hider's Hide skill <br/>modifier. The modifiers from Table 3-2: Spotting Difficulty still <br/>apply, except for the size modifier (which is already part of the <br/>character's skill modifier). A character whose Hide ranks, Dexterity <br/>modifier, and armor check penalty total -6 or lower is actually has <br/>a lower DC than if he or she weren't hiding. In such cases, simply <br/>calculate the Spot DC as if the character weren't hiding (according <br/>to Table: Spotting Difficulty). If a creature gets a special bonus to <br/>Hide because of camouflage, special coloring, and so on, use that <br/>bonus rather than the contrast bonus from Table: Spotting <br/>Difficulty.<br/><br/>Additionally, the other creatures do not automatically spot hiding <br/>creatures at one-half the encounter distance. Instead, that is the <br/>distance at which the other creatures can make Spot checks to <br/>notice the hiding creatures. These are normal Spot checks <br/>opposed by the hiders' Hide checks.<br/><br/>Table: Spotting Distance<br/><br/>Terrain\t\t\t\tDistance<br/>-------\t\t\t\t--------<br/>Smoke or heavy fog\t\t2d4 x 5 ft.

But sometimes you want to take <br/>into account the possibility that the two groups will miss each <br/>other entirely.<br/><br/>To handle these possibilities, simply let there be a 50% chance <br/>that the other creatures encountered and the PCs don't get any <br/>closer but rather pass by each other, such as when one group is <br/>moving north and the other east. (Creatures following the PCs' <br/>trail, of course, always close with them.)</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454898/#Comment_454898" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-08T22:52:14+00:00" title="July  8, 2016 10:52PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also enjoyed this blog post:<br/><br/><a href="https://muleabides.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/watch-out-for-that-fjord-more-on-wilderness-encounters-and-spotting/" rel="nofollow">https://muleabides.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/watch-out-for-that-fjord-more-on-wilderness-encounters-and-spotting/</a><br/><br/>And, more relevant to the larger, original topic, you are certainly not alone!<br/><br/>e.g. <a href="http://www.necropraxis.com/2013/03/04/osr-dogma-recency/" rel="nofollow">necropraxis.com/2013/03/04/osr-dogma-recency/</a><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455022/#Comment_455022" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-11T14:10:12+00:00" title="July 11, 2016  2:10PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2016 2:10PM by Airk.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I forgot to acknowledge / validate your reasons.<br/>I disagree with them!

They bear directly on the distance the PCs are likely to become aware of the wolves.   That is why I asked them.  The wolves are almost certainly aware of the PCs, and how they behave is going to influence how easy it is for the PCs to detect them.  As you can see from Paul's examples, most 'systems' for this stuff factor these kinds of things in.\n<blockquote>Everytime I bring up this example of the orc's baking skill, someone brings this up, they're the High Baker or they're the worst baker or they're the ordinary village orc baker or they're the orcish frontline soldier baker or... or... the <i>point</i> of the example is that it's something<br/>\u2022 <i>unexpected</i><br/>\u2022 <i>unusual</i><br/>\u2022 <i>could easily be high or low</i></blockquote>\nI think everyone is having a hard time imagining the circumstance in which you would:<br/><br/>A) Have a baking contest with an orc<br/>and<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Know nothing about him, even by surmise. <br/><br/>It certainly baffles me.  I literally cannot imagine a circumstance that matches your hypothetical, so I keep going back to the way I know circumstances emerge in games - from the fiction.  Even if I've just rolled an 89 on a "1d100 orcs" encounter, I immediately begin thinking about why there are 89 orcs here. And by the time we've gotten to a baking contest, I have a pretty good idea of what kind of people they are.  and odds are they haven't randomly selected a member of the tribe to enter the baking contest.  Even if this NPC literally had zero traces of existence 3 minutes before, now he is a part of the world and he needs to fit in and make sense with the rest of it.<br/><br/>I just can't wrap my head around the kind of situation you are trying to plan for here.  Not only has it never happened to me, but I can't grasp how it could.  Is an orc who is important enough to have a contest with not important enough to figure out how he fits into the tribe in some way?  This isn't some kind of crazy "cinematic" style of "everyone the PCs encounter is important" it's just a basic question of focus - objects that the PCs inspect more closely have more detail, because they need more detail, while the castle in the distance doesn't need much because no one is paying attention to it.    Even if you randomly generate some details, you obviously can't randomly generate all of them.  Sooner or later, you have to extrapolate from what the dice have already told you.\n<blockquote>In the example, you don't <b>know</b> if it's the high or low baker from the positioning, you have to have the skill value somehow.</blockquote>\nBut under what circumstances is this ever the case?<br/><br/>And yes, almost all systems have some sort of default assumption, but if the only rule you need is "This is what human average is" (which is basically the same as "here are the stats for a commoner") then I'm not sure why we even need to have this conversation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455384/#Comment_455384" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-30T00:15:08+00:00" title="July 30, 2016 12:15AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I get it now.<br/><br/>Every system has things <i>it</i> determines mechanically, and things it leaves <i>the GM</i> to determine.

We see lots of contradictory stuff in the advice. <br/><br/>My guess (after playing it RAW for a few years, then slightly drifting it, and digging into the history) was a mixture of backlash against certain playstyles and appeal to the core market (Rule 0 folks). Moldvay was the first* edition to try and unify and codify a D&amp;D playstyle. I suspect that's why Moldvay is largely ignored in the OSR scene. <br/><br/>*1977 Blackmoor tried this but it's really hard to parse and the manuscript is mostly notes from an evolving game. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455920/#Comment_455920" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T16:34:22+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  4:34PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having played a lot of Moldvay, then and now, I think the issue was that the mechanics for poison made it an unbalanced option for play.
