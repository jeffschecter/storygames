You can care about your character and the game world, let it be "real" because some of the processes are so externalized away from any one person's decisions.<br/>So as a DM, I use a transparent, almost hypermedialized method for this. Rolling openly, making it clear what rolls mean what, sometimes showing things from the book, revealing some of the numbers from the encounter tables. This is basic for many story games that have very visible and easily engaged mechanics.<br/><br/>The sensory component is aided by a game where the mechanics are invisible, where all you you have to do is close your eyes and dream away. You can imagine the smells, sounds, weights, sights of the fantasy world. These two components are often but not always in conflict.<br/><br/>Whenever I add mechanics I work hard to make them invisible, or DM-facing only, and when I get the vibe that the players need more buy-in, when they think that I'm just bullshitting, I reveal some of the mechanics. The mechanics should be solid, the players can rely on the mechanics creating and driving the events in their game world. This is to take away the sense of unease, to lessen the perceived power disparity between player and DM.<br/>Mechanics should also be associated directly with the goings on in the game. The cart should not be pulling the horse.<br/><br/>Games often (there are exceptions) thrive on choice and a solid mechanical landscape is great place to make solid and consequential choices.<br/><br/>And if you're always always always being made aware of the mechanics, it's taking away your dreaming power.<br/><br/>Here's an analogy. In early TV news, they would be very visible with their documents and reports in hand as paper, and cameras and mics would be visible. This makes it so that the audience gets a feeling of what's going on, "this is real". It builds buy-in.<br/>And when you watch a movie, you want the frame to fall away so that you just focus on the goings on in the film, you don't want to see any cameras or mics in Middle-Earth (although... wouldn't that be awesome?). It builds presence.<br/><br/>Anyway... it's sometimes a tradeoff, sometimes a balancing act, and sometimes something you can do without compromise because you can find mechanics that are both solid and non-intrusive.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454018/#Comment_454018" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-21T23:43:52+00:00" title="June 21, 2016 11:43PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find the media analogy quite fascinating. <br/><br/>Especially so, since *trust* and *familiarity* are such important factors in either type of engagement - and this mirrors media quite well.<br/><br/><b>Trust</b>: When I'm reading a book or watching a movie and something strange or inexplicable happens, it rubs up against my sense of trust in the creator to "make good". With a beloved author, I read on and my enjoyment isn't hampered. If I'm proofreading my little sister's creative writing assignment, though, I'll pause and mark it mentally as a problem with the story.<br/><br/>I can be thrown for a total loop - whether fictionally or mechanically - with a group of trusted players and I'm still totally engaged, right? But not so with just anybody.<br/><br/>Revealing your "behind-the-screen" processes, rolling out in the open, giving the players an insight into your GM-mind - all those help build trust.<br/><br/><b>Familiarity</b>: When people first started making movies, they filmed them exactly like a theatre play - complete with people walking on and off-stage. It took a while for people to realize that in this medium you could move the camera, change the angle, and generally play with perspective and framing.<br/><br/>People are very capable of "internalizing" familiar procedures and mechanics, until even complex, heavy rules seem "invisible". Even extremely simple rules, however, when unfamiliar, are decried as ruining this sort of "sensory" immersion. I've often seen internet discussions about "immersive roleplay" basically boil down to "what I'm familiar and comfortable with".<br/><br/>Good post, thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454023/#Comment_454023" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T03:07:35+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  3:07AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, Sandra.  I've observed the same things.  The one point on which I might disagree is the need for transparency to foster trust and power balance and emotional engagement.  Or, well, I disagree in principle and anecdote; odds-wise and historically, you're probably right.  And I completely agree with you on good, known mechanics being hard to beat in terms of facilitating a reliable sequence of meaningful choices.<br/><br/>An interesting thing about GM-facing mechanics -- I've written a bunch of them, and I often forget to use them.  I've found that, without the usual back-and-forth with the players, whether in system terms or just socially, GM-only procedures can be... not very reinforcing.  So, recently, I've started aiming for higher degrees of feedback from the system, so that rollng on a table or whatnot is a satisfying mini-game for the GM in itself.  Easier said than done, though, at least for my GMing taste.  I'd love to hear about what invisible GM techniques you've gotten the most mileage out of.  (Unless that's a thread jack.  Not sure if there's a particular desired direction here.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andye" title="Andye"><img alt="Andye" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andye">Andye</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454026/#Comment_454026" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T06:47:01+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  6:47AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the thing which reinforces player-facing rules is their social nature. Because they exist between us there is a social obligation not to break them. Most GM facing mechanics I've seen are solely the responsibility of the GM \u2013 she holds them all in her head.<br/><br/>Perhaps a way to codify GM-facing rules is to put them in the social sphere, by making the players responsible for them, just as the GM is largely responsible for the player-facing rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454028/#Comment_454028" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T08:37:01+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  8:37AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my current love affair with the two games Hillfolk and old-style D&amp;D are both because their support for "invisible" mechanics, right?<br/>In order to talk to the guard, you talk to the DM (who is pretending to be the guard).<br/>In order to find the map in the desk drawers, you tell the DM that you are opening the desk drawers and looking in them.<br/>In order to find out what the room smells like, you ask the DM what the smell is and she tells you.<br/>The invisibility or directness of these mechanics can (I hope!) build sensory engagement. Turkku school style.<br/><br/>As for DM-facing mechanics, my "mechanic for finding someone" is an example of that, as are wandering monster tables, encounter tables, stocking algorithms etc. A dungeon map + hour-by-hour rules (like wandering monster checks) is exactly the sort of "tangible landscape" to make choices against that can build emotional engagement.<br/><br/>Player-visible mechanics like  "OK, we're down to our last five HP... and there are monster checks every ten minutes... what are we going to do?" is anti-Turkku-school but can build emotional engagement.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454043/#Comment_454043" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T16:11:09+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  4:11PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2016 4:14PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that GM-facing mechanics, in this kind of play, is, by definition, a tremendously personal thing. <br/><br/>After all, it's a personal method which comes down to preference, experience, and subjective taste. Depending on the type of game and the type of GM you are, you may or may not need certain things to be handled for you for a sense of objectivity.<br/><br/>In a game which is supposed to challenge the players logistically, having a system for tracking torch use or wandering monsters is a way for the GM to bring that to bear. A very similar game with another group where one of the players is more familiar with the rules than the GM might find that person rolling the wandering monster checks and the GM more focused on portraying the sensory experience.<br/><br/>If the GM and/or group has had particularly good or bad experiences with certain tools and types of play, that colours all this *dramatically*, as well. <br/><br/>A certain GM might want certain tools in play not because of the effect it creates for the players, but merely for personal comfort - or to keep oneself from falling back into bad habits.<br/><br/>It looks like Sandra has found a highly functional way of playing which addresses a lot of her prior complaints/problems/sticking points. That's a great thing! It might look a little different for each group, or even for subsets of a given group, however.<br/><br/>This is also why I brought up <i>trust</i>, above.

It's all about what you do to give and take confidence.<br/><br/>Things that help build confidence: Using the same rules and rulings every time, blocking after you have said yes at least twice and only when there's a really good reason for it. Inform the players about possible outcomes that are clear for you but they haven't envisioned. Share all the information so players can properly decide, instead of hiding it from them so they will take the wrong decision. <br/><br/>Theres a great deal of immersion you can help players accomplish just by turning system information into fictional clear descrptions. You don't need to show everyone the monster's HP, but describing how damaged it's now, how scared it looks, how heavy is breathing, and doing this consistently from monster to monster will be enough for players to decide if they have to run or push a bit further to defeat it, which is exactly what they will decide by knowing the amount of HP, cheking their own and calculate how much damage they will be able to do in the next round, which while still kinda fun in it's own way, it's a totally different experience and immersion.<br/><br/>So basically, I've just realized that system doesn't have to be invisible at all, you just have to describe it to players in clear fictional terms.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454049/#Comment_454049" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T16:49:43+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  4:49PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A very similar game with another group where one of the players is more familiar with the rules than the GM might find that person rolling the wandering monster checks and the GM more focused on portraying the sensory experience.</blockquote>\n100% true, and Sandra approved.\n<blockquote>It looks like Sandra has found a highly functional way of playing which addresses a lot of her prior complaints/problems/sticking points.

I've had that experience, too. I once played OSR-style with Eero as GM, and I wasn't sure how to make decisions in a certain (somewhat difficult, and potentially unfair) situation. He offered to walk me through his mental process, and then did so: laid pretty much all his cards on the table. After that, I felt very certain that I could trust his judgement calls, because I understood where he was coming from. <br/><br/>The only part I think your analysis is missing is that when the trust exists, the transparency of method isn't necessary.<br/><br/>* Once Eero talked me through that particular example, he didn't have to do so AGAIN at each turn of the road. I felt comfortable enough to go on with fewer and fewer questions asked, because we had established a baseline of trust. The game became a lot more fun after that!<br/><br/>* Consider someone who is entering the experience with a high level of trust to begin. Say, a child roleplaying for the first time, or someone who, on the other end of the spectrum, has played with a certain group/GM for a decade and has already ironed out these kinks. (Which is not to imply that playing for a long time does that - it could erode trust over time, instead!)<br/><br/>That person has so little to gain from transparency of method that they will find your attempts distracting - they will be "ruining their immersion", when they're ready to jump straight into the sensory experience. They won't understand why you're doing that and can we please get back to the game already?<br/><br/>As another example, if I signed up for a convention game of personal horror which promised to frighten and surprise, I wouldn't expect or want the GM to be transparent with their methods - I've prepared myself for this metaphorical "jumping into the deep end of the pool". <br/><br/>Even though in other situations I'd very much like to know what the GM is thinking and how they're making their decisions - I LOVED Eero's transparency in that game, including side comments like, "Yikes! You've wandered into the swamps - I should warn you, I'll be using wandering monster tables from such-and-such module there, and they're infamous for being unfair!" - there will be some cases where that's not desirable at all.\n<blockquote><br/>Transparency of method is an easily reproducible method of building that trust.<br/></blockquote>\nYes! Exactly. And that's a great insight for a lot of roleplaying groups. Nailed it!<br/><br/>As a general principle for improving trust in a group, I'm totally on board with this.

These sort of shibboleths and conventions are exactly what I referred to as something that sometimes "can help engagement and sometimes they can hinder it and sometimes neither."<br/><br/>The original Fudge's "I'm Good with swords" is another, more codified example.<br/><br/>Paul, first of all, I really, really appreciate this post right now.<br/><small>I got into a very heated discussion with someone over at TPB and I only later saw that they were a mod. But it was very well deserved, they were very disrespectful. But I'm worried now that they're discussing amongst themselves in the mod area and are going to drop some sort of hammer. Hopefully the other mods will see where I was coming from, especially if they go back and read the thread.</small><br/><br/>So I'm glad to discuss an issue with someone who gets it, like you do. Thank you.\n<blockquote>The only part I think your analysis is missing is that when the trust exists, the transparency of method isn't necessary.</blockquote>\nI've played RPGs for 24 years and I've never experienced that trust. Thus, transparency of method is rocket fuel for me to help me get engaged with the goings on in the game.\n<blockquote>Once Eero talked me through that particular example, he didn't have to do so AGAIN at each turn of the road. I felt comfortable enough to go on with fewer and fewer questions asked, because we had established a baseline of trust.</blockquote>\nI worked hard to keep the initial post brief but yes. Fewer and fewer questions are needed. This is a tricky road because it can open up into DMs eventually starting to fudge. This was some of my earliest long threads here on S-G with "Mode X", the black curtain etc.<br/><br/>My OP <em>does</em> say explicitly that it can sometimes be a tradeoff or clash between transparancy of method vs invisible mechanics. You sometimes have to make compromises, a balancing act.\n<blockquote>Consider someone who is entering the experience with a high level of trust to begin. Say, a child roleplaying for the first time, or someone who, on the other end of the spectrum, has played with a certain group/GM for a decade and has already ironed out these kinks. (Which is not to imply that playing for a long time does that - it could erode trust over time, instead!)</blockquote>\nThat was my experience, yes (the erosion, that is).\n<blockquote>That person has so little to gain from transparency of method that they will find your attempts distracting - they will be "ruining their immersion", when they're ready to jump straight into the sensory experience. They won't understand why you're doing that and can we please get back to the game already?</blockquote>\nWhen I started my 5e game I was eager to try out this "transparency of method" idea. And the new players who had never ever played any RPG or story game, they loved it. And the veteran RQ-and-3e-with-fudging-DMs players, they gave me a lot of pushback, exactly "can we please get back to the game already?".<br/><br/>But quickly it started working on them, too. They got emotional engagement in a way that I had never seen in them before (I had tried to play both Fate Core and Diaspora with them, but not with "transparency of method"). And now they're very engaged in the random encounter mechanics, trying to find safe camp in the vampire castle, making hard choices.<br/><br/><em>They killed other innocent humans (in the game, relax) just so their characters could get some sleep.</em>\n<blockquote>As another example, if I signed up for a convention game of personal horror which promised to frighten and surprise, I wouldn't expect or want the GM to be transparent with their methods - I've prepared myself for this metaphorical "jumping into the deep end of the pool".</blockquote>\nI played Monsterhearts at a con with a GM who was pretty good at transparency of method (whoops, forgot about him when I wrote earlier that I hadn't) -- and it really really helped me. So I disagree. I've also played AW with some MCs that are good at this and some that aren't, and I prefered the ones that were good at transparency of method.\n<blockquote>Even though in other situations I'd very much like to know what the GM is thinking and how they're making their decisions - I LOVED Eero's transparency in that game, including side comments like, "Yikes! You've wandered into the swamps - I should warn you, I'll be using wandering monster tables from such-and-such module there, and they're infamous for being unfair!" - there will be some cases where that's not desirable at all.</blockquote>\nBecause both sensory engagement and emotional engagement are very necessary and important. And they are built in different ways and hurt in different ways. Sometimes clashing.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454066/#Comment_454066" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T17:57:03+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  5:57PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WM, didn't mean to say that you didn't "get it"; I wrote my answer to Paul and saw your post come in while I was writing.

I used to always play this way, and now I still do when with the right group.\n<blockquote>As for DM-facing mechanics, my "mechanic for finding someone" is an example of that, as are wandering monster tables, encounter tables, stocking algorithms etc. A dungeon map + hour-by-hour rules (like wandering monster checks) is exactly the sort of "tangible landscape" to make choices against that can build emotional engagement.</blockquote>I am familiar with these, but hadn't thought much about them.  <br/><br/>IIRC, "find someone" is actually triggered by a player query, so the overall procedure is similar to "talk to the guard by talking to the GM" -- the only difference is that the GM informs their reply with a roll.  I think that's a very useful class of GM mechanics -- good answers to questions which it's otherwise hard to answer well.  I don't use such mechanics very often, because I can usually provide a sufficient answer on my own, and the delay and effort of finding the right table and rolling on it and parsing the result can be too high a price to pay to get from "sufficient" to "good".  A good GM screen might change all that, though.<br/><br/>Attaching event checks (e.g. wandering monsters) to time spent is pretty powerful on the "tangible landscape" front, I agree.  Rather than having a <i>fact</i> to react to, the players get a <i>process</i>.  And we can game a process!  Especially a process that adds risk over time, creating a "push your luck" situation.  I have often tried to introduce processes into adventuring environments, but I'm often stopped by the nuisances of tracking.  How much character action takes an hour of time?  Do I need to do math with movement rates?  Is anything going to remind me to make a check when I get caught up in the fiction of the moment (which I always do)?<br/><br/>I'm not sure what "stocking algorithms" means.  I'm also not sure whether encounter tables are more like query answers or processes or neither.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on this stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454093/#Comment_454093" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T22:13:41+00:00" title="June 22, 2016 10:13PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, it seems like you totally get it.<br/>The "find someone" is two parts.<br/>1. a roll to randomly place where the quarry is.<br/>2. a roll to randomly determine what the interrogated person knows<br/>Those two are made <i>before</i> the scene is RP:d.<br/><br/>Stocking algorithms: dungeon making algorithms.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454098/#Comment_454098" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T22:47:29+00:00" title="June 22, 2016 10:47PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2016 6:36PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>Looking through some old posts on this site and am reminded that there's a policy to not harsh on other forums.

One emotion of learning is fun (Raph Koster - Theory of Fun). We learn through a loop (Daniel Cook - Skill atom, Martin Heidegger - The hermeneutic circle). <blockquote>(a) We form an idea, (b) we try to make it happen, (c) we get a response, (a) we update the idea.</blockquote> Every time we go through this loop, we learn. Every time we learn, an emotional response is created. If it already exist in our mind, the emotion gets stronger (Nico Frijda and Batja Mequita - Emotions and Convictions - How Feelings Affect Our Thoughts).<br/><br/>Given this premise above, it doesn't really matter how the loop is created - how the responses are delivered - as long as the loop is unbroken. It doesn't matter if it's narrative techniques or mechanics.<br/><br/>Here probably lies your trust discussion. Mechanics are often seen as objective - unbiased. I always thought about this, as newbie game masters "need" mechanics as a crutch because they don't trust themselves in the beginning. They can later on leave the mechanics when they are stable enough to stand on their own legs. The same could possibly apply to a "game master-player" relation.<br/><br/>The loop gets broken if the player breaks the loop by thinking that the game master is biased: if the player goes outside the "system" (either game system or the social system [the group itself]) in a form of metaplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454122/#Comment_454122" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T17:41:45+00:00" title="June 23, 2016  5:41PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't agree with this.

I meant when you dream away and imagine yourself seeing, hearing, smelling things from the game world. Often crunch can hurt this.<br/><br/>By emotional engagement we probably do mean the same thing. When you are invested in the decisions and outcomes in the game world. Often crunch can help this.<br/><br/>As for the loop, I come from another epistemological tradition ("against method") so through my eyes, it looks like either the loop analogy/process is too narrowly defined to be encompassing even a plurality of acquisitions of knowledge or emotion, or it's conversely so widely defined to be meaningless in its unspecificity. Regardless, let's say I buy into Heidegger's loop idea -- even so, I posit that the 'sensory'/lucid "track" and the 'emotional'/agentorial "track" are on separate loops, sometimes interacting with each other in a helping or hindering way, sometimes not.<br/><br/>Rickard, you have an interesting perspective as always.

Every GM should rely on good techniques, and (though I seem to be an outlier due to my improv background) every player should as well.

But Unknown Armies (which is easily one of the most emotionally engaging RPGs I've ever encountered) doesn't, and that changes everything. And how your character feels about another is typically invisible, but make that transparent and again that changes everything.<br/><br/>What are you leaving transparent/invisible, and what are you trying to achieve by it?\n<blockquote>My great breakthrough as a GM was when I finally realized how strongly we could build emotional engagement by trying to contradict what you just wrote as much as possible.<br/>That's what I refer to as "transparency of method".</blockquote>\nBut is emotional engagement synonymous with <i>trust</i> here?

What I've found however is most of the time definitions actually get broader in discussions like this and people start arguing about what those words <i>really</i> mean.<br/><br/>Hasn't happened here yet, and I don't suspect it will, but keep an eye out for it on other fora.\n<blockquote>I am using <b>transparency</b> to create <b>accountability</b>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It's the <em>method</em> that there's <b>transparency</b> about and <b>accountability</b> for.</blockquote>\nNow <i>this</i> I can get on board with, and I think accountability rather than transparency is what leads to stronger emotional engagement.\n<blockquote>I don't want to criticize UA when Greg's not here.</blockquote>\nWhile considerate, why should he care as long as that criticism is honest, rational, and respectful? I'd hate to think that as a game designer people will not discuss my game unless I'm participating.\n<blockquote>Suffice it to say that I've played in games where hitpoints were known to the DM but not to the players and decremented/incremented in an unaccountable way and my experiences with that particular aspect of the game was awful.</blockquote>\nWere these games <i>specifically designed with hidden HP</i> in mind, or was it a houserule added by the GM?<br/><br/>See, in UA attempting to inflict mortal harm on another human being is <i>a big fucking deal</i>. It's the kind of thing you only try when the stakes are so important that the odds don't matter. It's a game where every human life has value which can't be reduced to a set of numbers, so it doesn't. And the lack of transparency puts you in the same mindset as a man covered in (what they're pretty sure is) their own blood and unsure of whether they're going to die from that tiny little hole that won't stop bleeding. If HP and Damage were transparent you'd never achieve this.<br/><br/>On the other hand a character's mental state is not just transparent, but explicit and central (especially in 3rd ed) to gameplay. You <i>know</i> how close you are to being a sociopath. You <i>know</i> how that shift in mental state made you more or less able to do a certain thing. You <i>know</i> how far you character is from just not being able to deal with it anymore.<br/><br/>Most RPGs do exactly the opposite however, making HP explicit and mental states implicit. So you <i>know</i> how close you are to death. You <i>know</i> how much damage you did to that monster. You <i>know</i> when you can safely engage in combat. And so attempting to inflict mortal harm on another becomes a frequent and casual activity in play.\n<blockquote>Emotional engagement is one of my goals of play.

On the other hand, I know GMs who <i>audibly</i> roll 'secret' perception checks behind a screen just to make their players nervous, which creates engagement but still isn't a game mechanic because it doesn't modify the actual choices or abilities the player has at their disposal.<br/><br/>Coincidentally it's also another example of how obfuscation of method can create emotional engagement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454161/#Comment_454161" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T07:32:35+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  7:32AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2016 7:33AM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hasn't happened here yet, and I don't suspect it will, but keep an eye out for it on other fora.</blockquote>\nOK. For now,  "mechanics" has many meanings and I was specifically using a meaning that included prodecures.<br/><br/>I have a life vow that says "Never again argue semantics" and I won't. That life vow typically has me switching over to the other person's definitions, and then if I originally wanted to talk about something else, I'll make up a new word or phrase and give the definition I really meant. In this case, though, I don't think it's unreasonable to use my original definition.<br/><br/>I was specifically listing examples of mechanics that included using description rather than dice rolls to search a desk or talk to a guard. Because for the purposes of <em>this</em> discussion, those are examples of process and procedures that can be codified.\n<blockquote><blockquote>It's the <em>method</em> that there's <b>transparency</b> about and <b>accountability</b> for.</blockquote>\nNow <i>this</i> I can get on board with, and I think accountability rather than transparency is what leads to stronger emotional engagement.</blockquote>\nI think knowedge about and trust in the <em>method</em> in play (as opposed to trust in a particular participant), that's a very strong source of emotional engagement. In my experience, people get more engaged when know what game they are playing and that that game works (including any nomic properties of the game).\n<blockquote>Were these games <i>specifically designed with hidden HP</i> in mind, or was it a houserule added by the GM?</blockquote>\nAll GMs are game designers in some sense. I've played with the technique in various games including UA (which was designed for it), CoC (which has similar qualities to UA), and DoD which as different design goals than UA/CoC but a similar mechanical engine, and D&amp;D in which it was a complete and utter clusterfail. The experiences are different for each game, yes. But they have similarities too in that it's a big old shenanigan enabler.\n<blockquote>See, in UA attempting to inflict mortal harm on another human being is [...] were transparent you'd never achieve this.</blockquote>\nI'm not a child. I know UA well.<br/><br/>You snipped out my little aside about using face down cards or similar mechanics for HP, but I hope you did read it, because that wasn't meant as "Sandra UA house rule hour" but as a point to state this:<br/><br/>I'm specifically <em>not</em> adamant about transparency of <em>content</em>. Current HP state is content. So, the transparency or opacity of current amount of HP is 100% orthogonal to what I'm saying.<br/><br/>I'm about transparency of <em>method</em>. The facts that<br/>\u2022 HP is decremented (by zero or more) when someone risks their life<br/>\u2022 The delta is determined by the system rather than any one participant's whim<br/>\u2022 The sum having certain states have certain consequences<br/><br/>That's method.<br/><br/>The state where<br/>\u2022 The delta, source of that delta, reason for that delta, and the sum is tracked in an verifiable method<br/>\u2022 The costs and consequences of having certain sums is known to all participants, even when the sum itself isn't known to all participants<br/><br/>That's transparency of that method.<br/><br/>Now, I'm aware that with our current design tools and commonly known mechanics, sometimes transparency of method can clash with having mechanics become invisible, or transparency of method can be time consuming, labor intensive and just not feeling "worth it". It's a constant tradeoff and balancing act, we can't neglect the other values we work with in play, such as expedient and easy processes etc.\n<blockquote>You <i>know</i> how much damage you did to that monster.</blockquote>\nWhen looking at for example Pathfinder as it's commonly played, this is not the case.\n<blockquote>And so attempting to inflict mortal harm on another becomes a frequent and casual activity in play.</blockquote>\nI hardly think of it as a casual activity. Transparency of method has led to "Oh shit, orcs!! Can we run? Where can we go!" happen way more often than it did when I was GMing using opaque methods.<br/><br/>However, it's an activity that is explicitly engaged in, that's right. Just as your current mental state is something that is explicitly in play in UA. UA uses transparency of method for that part of the game and that's a part of the game that's well-loved by many -- I have to tread carefully here since mental health is a touchy subject for me.\n<blockquote>But obfuscation of method is another, which is kinda the bugbear in all of this.</blockquote>\nJust to be absolutely sure before I move on; are you talking about opacity of <em>content</em> (such as HP values) rather than opacity of <em>method</em>?<br/><br/>I've experimented so much, as a DM and as a player, with opacity of <em>method</em> with disastrous results.<br/>My results with opacity of <em>content</em> on the other hand have been pretty good.\n<blockquote>Game mechanics are a <i>kind</i> of procedure, but rolling things like secret perception checks are a procedure I do not consider to be a game mechanic, as it doesn't facilitate play between participants nor create/require/enable engagement from the players.</blockquote>\nFor the purposes of <em>this discussion</em>, it is mechanics, and it is method, and you're singling out a subset of it as "mechanics".<br/><br/>Now, would I think having a word for that subset would be good? Certainly.<br/>Would I accept giving up my definition of mechanics, giving you the word mechanics to apply to your subset, and coming up with another word (you've suggested "procedures") to apply to my hypernym? Very reluctantly but according to my life vow, I'd have to at least consider it.<br/><br/>But please consider this analogy.<br/>A: "Oooh I love apples, they are great in fruit salad."<br/>B: "Hmm, really? I always thought oranges were best in fruit salad."<br/>A: "I like one orange and then a whole bunch of apples."<br/>B: "Yuck, no, that sounds weird to eat, too crispy"<br/>C: "Actually, you're both wrong, because only pomegranates are actually the real apples, and they're not pomaceous fruits, they're from a completly different genus, and their seeds are sweet and not crispy so they work well in a fruit salad. We need to use precise language. And so you're wrong, B."<br/><br/>I just realized how snarky this whole section looks, especially that analogy. See, this is what happens when I get into semantics. And I also realize that pomegranates and apples don't have a hyponymy relationship, while mechanics-your-definition <em>is</em> a subset of mechanics-my-definition.<br/><br/>But B in the apple story <em>was</em> talking about crispy apples, and I <em>am</em> talking about procedures and methods that <em>do</em> include things like perception checks, encounter tables etc.<br/><br/>That I called them "mechanics", something you have another definition for, doesn't mean that I only want to talk about things that players directly engage with. I want to talk about things that any participant around the table engages with, including the GM.\n<blockquote>Coincidentally it's also another example of how obfuscation of method can create emotional engagement.</blockquote>\nMy experience so far over the last decades has been that it very much can create a strong emotional <em>response</em> but it erodes emotional <em>engagement</em>.

My bad.<br/><br/>I also think a deeper discussion on how transparent methods compromise the right to dream would be awesome, but perhaps this isn't the best thread for that.\n<blockquote>I have a life vow that says "Never again argue semantics" and I won't.</blockquote>\nThere's arguing semantics, and then there's <i>reaching consensus about what words mean</i>. One's political and yeah, I don't do that either. The other is rather important here because I suspect what you're talking about is being obscured by the words you're choosing, at least for me.\n<blockquote>I think knowedge about and trust in the <em>method</em> in play (as opposed to trust in a particular participant), that's a very strong source of emotional engagement. In my experience, people get more engaged when know what game they are playing and that that game works (including any nomic properties of the game).</blockquote>\nI don't think it creates emotional engagement so much as it <i>allows</i> for it. Nobody can engage in (what they at least believe to be) a completely unpredictable environment, but a predictable environment is not itself emotionally engaging.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Were these games <i>specifically designed with hidden HP in mind</i>, or was it a houserule added by the GM?</blockquote>I've played with the technique in various games including UA (which was designed for it), CoC (which has similar qualities to UA), and DoD which as different design goals than UA/CoC but a similar mechanical engine, <b>and D&amp;D in which it was a complete and utter clusterfail</b>. The experiences are different for each game, yes.</blockquote>\nAnd that's because in D&amp;D explicit HP knowledge is a vital communications channel and source of tension. You can't just rip it out and expect the game to work.\n<blockquote><blockquote>You <i>know</i> how much damage you did to that monster.</blockquote>When looking at for example Pathfinder as it's commonly played, this is not the case.</blockquote>\nSo damage rolls <i>aren't</i> made openly?\n<blockquote><blockquote>And so attempting to inflict mortal harm on another becomes a frequent and casual activity in play.</blockquote>I hardly think of it as a casual activity. Transparency of method has led to "Oh shit, orcs!! Can we run? Where can we go!" happen way more often than it did when I was GMing using opaque methods.</blockquote>\nNot surprising that in such games avoiding mortal harm would become a frequent and casual activity too :P\n<blockquote>Would I accept giving up my definition of mechanics, giving you the word mechanics to apply to your subset, and coming up with another word (you've suggested "procedures") to apply to my hypernym?</blockquote>\nFirst, 'mechanics' and 'procedures' are the same thing when it comes to RPGs. Second, I was already using a subset when I identified <i>game</i> mechanics as <i>something which facilitates play between participants</i>.\n<blockquote>I want to talk about things that any participant around the table <b>engages</b> with, including the GM.</blockquote>\nI also think 'engage' is too broad a term to effectively address anything. I define it as dual parts <i>interest</i> and <i>interaction</i>, but I'm not sure that properly aligns with how you're using it in this discussion.\n<blockquote>My experience so far over the last decades has been that it very much can create a strong emotional <em>response</em> but it erodes emotional <em>engagement</em>.</blockquote>\nI <i>think</i> I get what you're trying to say, but I also think neither of these two words clearly conveys it. Exactly what criteria are you using to differentiate them?<br/><br/>I'm also curious as to your opinion on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/7thSea/comments/4nfb47/when_you_dont_need_dice_for_drama/" rel="nofollow">this example from the new 7th Sea</a>.\n<blockquote>But life's too short, so I won't try to change your mind about your preferred nomenclature.</blockquote>\nI don't have a preferred nomenclature.<br/><br/>I may have preferred <i>notation</i> when it comes to things like mathematics, but I have no particular loyalty to the words and symbols people use to identify concepts. Honestly adopting specific words as important in themselves is one of the more confusing and destructive things I've seen humans do.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454375/#Comment_454375" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-30T12:30:27+00:00" title="June 30, 2016 12:30PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, great post!<br/>Will respond more soon<br/><br/>It's very very common in the D&amp;D &amp; PF world to hide monster HP.
