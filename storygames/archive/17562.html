Here is the Visitor: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyOEhtb1ZzclRZR1U/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyOEhtb1ZzclRZR1U/edit</a><br/><br/>I was inspired by the Queen, which I consider to be one of the most interesting Skins out there. Skins like Vampire and Witch and Werewolf are very fun, but they are really driven by horror archetypes. The Queen is (IMHO) the only Skin that is really driven by social archetypes. He or she can have a variety of Origins (whether supernatural or not), but his or her social position remains "center of power." Since Monsterhearts is about teenage social standing as much as it is about scary monsters, I thought it would be fun to add in another Skin driven primarily by the social side of things.<br/><br/>Like the Queen, the Visitor has many possible Origins -- some are crazy b-movie plots, others are relatively mundane. The Visitor can be everything from an extraterrestial to a foreign exchange student to a parallel-earth doppelganger to a spy. But whichever Origin you choose, the Visitor's social position remains "outsider torn between two worlds."<br/><br/>And, just a few things I know I'll get asked:<br/>* I have no artistic abilities, so this is not formatted like other Monsterhearts skins, and it does not have a picture. (Any artistic people want to assist?)<br/>* I have not playtested the Visitor. <br/>* Compared to other Skins, the Visitor's Achievement options give one additional "Take another Visitor move" and one fewer "Take a move from another Skin." This is intentional, since the Visitor has several other ways of acquiring other Skin moves, sometimes at the price of losing a Visitor move; the Achievements help make sure the Visitor can keep some Visitor moves in play!<br/><br/>Any feedback would be appreciated!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398271/#Comment_398271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T21:32:08+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  9:32PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, but it kind of forces the Lost Love to show up.

I had not really been looking at it that way. There is definitely a big story payoff if the Visitor has sex with the <i>lost love</i>, but I tried to steer clear from making the <i>lost love</i>'s presence required; none of the other Moves mention the <i>lost love</i>, and even with the Sex Move, there are still interesting consequences if the Visitor has sex with someone other than the <i>lost love</i> (especially if the sex is with the <i>new love</i>). I can see, though, how having an off-screen NPC with three Strings on a PC would be a very tempting offer for the MC.<br/><br/>One other thought I had was that if the Visitor selects the <b>Reporting back</b> move, it could be the <i>lost love</i> who is being reported to!<br/><br/>And thanks for the feedback!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398292/#Comment_398292" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T05:29:26+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  5:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it, but you're kind of making a foreign exchange student equivalent to some sort of actual alien from outer space.

In this case, the archetype was along the lines of "torn between old life and new." <br/><br/>The various Origins like "alien" or "foreign exchange student" are not to say that a foreign exchange student is like an extraterrestrial in all aspects, just to show that they both can have the whole "torn between old life and new" mindset and giving players who want to play a character with this mindset as many choices as possible. Though, in hindsight, I realized I missed what is probably the most obvious Origins: the new kid.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398337/#Comment_398337" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T11:26:07+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 11:26AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, clone is probably more a Hollow thing, you're right.</blockquote>\nIMHO, a key thematic difference between the Visitor and the Hollow (whether played as a clone, a robot, a Frankenstein monster or anything else) is that the Visitor has an entire life that's been lived in a far-away place, and much of the conflict comes from missing the old life and learning to embrace the new life. The Hollow, on the other hand, had NO life before, so the conflict comes from being essentially a newborn in a teenager's body and experiencing the entire world for the first time. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398338/#Comment_398338" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T11:29:23+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 11:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's true about the Selkie, but I've always wanted a skin or two that was more sci-fi than fantasy.

Haven't really had a desire to, either <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398394/#Comment_398394" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T22:24:56+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 10:24PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If an NPC has strings on a PC, the NPC needs to show up in some form or other, or it's a total waste of strings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398507/#Comment_398507" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T08:32:45+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  8:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If an NPC has strings on a PC, the NPC needs to show up in some form or other, or it's a total waste of strings.</blockquote>\nThat is a good point. My main reason for introducing the Lost Love is to give the Visitor someone in his/her past as an obstacle towards future happiness; the 3 Strings I gave to the Lost Love were more along the lines of "Well, just in case the MC finds a way to bring in the Lost Love, I'd better make sure there are the appropriate number of Strings!" <br/><br/>I am going to take a look at rewriting that part, possibly even making it so the Lost Love could optionally be a PC. UserClone had a great idea about a possible origin for the Visitor being "time traveler"; it might be fun to see the Visitor from the 1800s meet up with the same Vampire PC he/she was in love with 200 years ago.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398514/#Comment_398514" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T11:40:23+00:00" title="November 23, 2012 11:40AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THAT would be hot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398869/#Comment_398869" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T10:54:16+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 10:54AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that this has a mix of normal and extranormal origins, like the Queen. That's awesome. I agree that in these kinds of stories, the difference between a foreign exchange student and an actual alien is negligible. They're just outsiders. But maybe you should have the player "select all that apply" from that list - they could be an alien posing as a foreign exchange student or new guy or whatever.<br/><br/>I like the Agendas, but I'd take out Return as an agenda - because it can be completed and because successfully completing that agenda takes the character out of the game. For the same reason, you don't want something like "Find Your Lost ___" as an agenda, because once you accomplish it, it's done. The other agendas are great because they aren't a lightswitch that can be flipped. Learning, hiding, and healing can go on indefinitely.<br/><br/>Likewise, I'd rework the Darkest Self so it didn't point so strongly to the possibility of taking the character out of the story.<br/><br/>I think the Lost Love concept is a big fat arrow constantly pointing off screen. It doesn't help - I'd remove it entirely. I'd replace New Love with Anchor. Your Anchor is the person you have found in this new place that makes you feel a little comfortable. I'd treat the Anchor like the Lover for the Mortal - you always have exactly one, but whom it is can change. That way, the Anchor can be more vague. It can be someone who reminds you of your other place/time/whatever. Or it can be someone who has made you feel welcome and accepted, even if it's only them that accepts you. (And being Monsterhearts, that acceptance and welcoming is likely to get screwed up, which is why the Anchor should be able to be transferred). Or some of both. I think the sex move already does enough to connect the Anchor to being a lover - I don't think you need to connect it more explicitly than that.<br/><br/>Reporting Back could be expanded to include comfort as well as orders, maybe. It still fits that being overheard results in a String - you're exposing a source of neediness.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398873/#Comment_398873" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T10:58:56+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 10:58AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Home Remedy seems maybe a bit overpowered?
