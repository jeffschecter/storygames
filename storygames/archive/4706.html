I am giving unparalleled focus on word choice in the rules, and the character sheet should be no exception. For any given word, it should (a) describe what it refers to as accurately as possible, and (b) be comprehensible to all potential customers of above-average intelligence. As to this latter point, I recognize that some of my word choices are obscure or "stilted", but I'm okay with that if they serve function (a) significantly. In short, the two criteria above are listed <i>in order of importance</i>.<br/><br/>2) General Layout - As I indicated, this is just a mock-up. When it comes time for the real deal, I'll pay someone with more skillz than I've got to make it look pretty. But I am concerned, even at this stage, about the general layout, e.g., location, order, and flow of the elements.<br/><br/>3) Missing Items - I know most of you know little to nothing about this game, but I think, in some ways, that is helpful at this stage. (If you can't resist, you can learn more about it <a href="http://justinjacobson.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.) Is there anything jumping out at you that's missing from the sheet, let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105935/#Comment_105935" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T09:44:33+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  9:44AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find "experiential qualities" a confusing term -- I first read it as "experimental qualities", which made even less sense.

I'll let the pro worry about the color combos; I'll probably go with white on black for right now.<br/><br/>"Not enough space" how? Horizontally, vertically, both?

One of my pet peeves is a client wanting me to "pretty up" something they've laid out in powerpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a designer I see lots of clutter, no focus or dominance, and wasted space. If you were one of my clients, the first thing I would have you do is write a list of everything you want to include and rate it according to how visually important it should be. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind the difference between a designer and an artist. A good designer will know how to structure and organize your information in a visually appealing and functional manner. An artist will make something look pretty, but not necessarily usable. A good designer is usually a good artist as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm more than happy to help pretty it up for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114617/#Comment_114617" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T04:25:35+00:00" title="December 16, 2007  4:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never read experiential before either, but I had no problem getting the meaning.

I will say that I am toying with doing all my own layout this time, but we'll see. When I deal with freelancers I always give very free reign over their part of the project, and that certainly includes layout and design.<br/><br/>Stefan, thanks for the input. "Core" is supposed to represent whatever is most important to that character. It could be a belief, principle, idea, or even an object, a relationship, or a phsyical quality.

The other quality descriptors are all concerned with the fictional appearance of the quality, while core describes the quality's narrative value. In theory core qualities could be intrinsic, experience or any of the others.<br/><br/>You might want to give the field another kind of boundary, like you did with Negative. Double lines perhaps.<br/><br/><br/>Still, I think fundamental is better.
