At this point it's like I'm doing the trick where you play chess against two people and copy the moves from one game to another <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> The ideas are mine, but I'm getting some ideas when wrestling with them that I can relay here, and some ideas when wrestling with you that I can relay there, so I come across as twice as smart and/or ditzy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></small><br/>The game with the earliest publication date I've seen this in, is Spirit of the Century. What am I talking about? The idea of "social damage", trying to get someone to be "taken out" with "zingers" and "arguments" (i.e. bullying them 'til they crack) <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>This could also be seen as inflicting damage on their "status in the group" instead of their mental well-being.<br/><br/>Anyway, in Diaspora, it had evolved into play on a map with different corners.<br/>In a game we played, the PCs had some trouble on the ship where they were serfs, and we made a map with five corners:<br/><br/>1. They're fired<br/>2. They're thrown into the airlock and killed<br/>3. They're promoted for their out-of-the-box thinking<br/>4. Unchanged status quo for a while longer (on the bottom of the pecking order in the ship -- their troublemaking was just expected behavior from their class)<br/>5. They steal a shuttle ship and skedaddle.<br/><br/>And then blank spaces in between and a timer (a timer that could also be manipulated by the participants' action, iirc, but it also ticked on one round at a time). The game has mechanics for roleplaying, using skills augmented by aspects etc in order to end up close to one of the corners. Getting all the way to the corner would also end it iirc.<br/><br/>Very interesting, a skill challenge like system but with many outcomes.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was muddled up by there simultaneously being a stress-track for social damage on the participants and they could spend actions not only to move around on the board, but also to "inflict damage" on each other. (By "participants" I mean both PCs and NPCs.)<br/><br/>That made it work significantly worse.<br/><br/>Fate Core fixed it by making contests and conflicts very different, and making these situations a contest instead. They still have a remnant of the social stress track, which is dumb, but they have a contest system that's clearly separated from trying to harm each other. When I saw that, I went "Why didn't I think of that!" It felt so obvious. But, presence of the stress track and "social wounds" created the conveyance/affordance that it was there to be used. (FAE did the right thing removing it. My one concession to FAE. + the art is great.)<br/><br/>This quote from FC is great: "If someone tries to attack in a contest, then they\u2019re doing direct harm, and it ceases to be a contest. You should immediately stop what you\u2019re doing and start setting up for a conflict instead."<br/><br/>As an OT side note, FC sadly brought back the "only having one<br/>outcome"-nature of skill challenges. Succeed "forward" or fail<br/>"forward" -- in Diaspora you could end up in any of many directions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462590/#Comment_462590" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T15:07:44+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  3:07PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's been lots of games with this idea before FATE, too - I think the origins are probably in the late '90s, but I can't name the specific game off-hand. I do remember that it was fresh but not revolutionary in <i>Hero Wars</i> around the millennium. Getting into the mainstream is, of course, different.<br/><br/>Many games that use the idea of "social damage" also use the idea that "damage" is just a way to pace conflicts: you know that the conflict has ended by the fact that there is no longer a participant with any hit points left. This is sort of the reverse of the other common conflict-resolution method, which is point-accumulation. Instead of "trying to score a success" or several, you are trying to reduce an opponent's score to zero, and once there is nobody left to resist you, success is automatic.<br/><br/>I'm saying this just to make sure that everybody understands that "social damage" is often not intended to be interpreted as much more than just a conceit of dramatic pacing: because we need a way to tell when to stop arguing and who will give in, we roll some dice and deduct some points, and whoever runs out first will give in and let the other guy have their way. It's just pacing.<br/><br/>Of course it depends on the context whether you'd want to use something like this at all. The conflict map setup you describe from Diaspora sounds like something where one shouldn't use these two concepts side by side.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462591/#Comment_462591" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T15:50:24+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  3:50PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Any mechanic at all that frames social interaction as a conflict leaves a bad taste in my mouth. "But that's entirely missing the point of social interaction!" I rail and wail. Framing conversation as violence\u2014"duel of wits", "social combat", "riposte", "cutting words"\u2014exacerbates it, but the core thing I take issue with is the idea that you can win and lose a conversation at all.<br/><br/>If you can win or lose a conversation, someone is already being an enormous asshole, or is being manipulative and coercive, or there is a huge and relevant power imbalance between the interlocutors, or you are in some weird formalized situation such as a court of law\u2014you are already far outside the bounds of normal social interaction.<br/><br/>When the only mechanics on social interaction are relevant just to these degenerate, bizarre circumstances, it encourages us to frame all social interaction as such degenerate, bizarre adversarial bouts, which is <i>hella dumb</i> but also easy. And it's easy to overlook that you're doing it.<br/><br/>In a real conversation, the important questions are:<br/><br/>- Have we properly established the common ground?<br/>- Do we actually know what our interlocutors want?<br/>- What is it that they want?<br/>- Are we expressing our ideas in a way our interlocutors understand and can relate to?<br/><br/>Things like OD&amp;D Reaction Rolls are really good for some of that stuff\u2014they basically prompt the DM to make decisions about common ground, goals, and communication style in a favorable or unfavorable way, before the conversation starts.<br/><br/>I'm also interested in using some fairly light binary or ternary mechanics to sprinkle this kind of prompt throughout the interaction. Like, player speaks, players throws dice, depending on the result GM is prompted to have NPCs respond in a way that reveals and aligns goals, or creates misunderstandings and conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462595/#Comment_462595" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T16:52:35+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  4:52PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh that'd be fun. Simple strawman:<br/><br/>When there's a question of NPC reaction in a social interaction which would feel weird and wrong to characterize as a social combat, roll +SOC and add/subtract a number your GM tells you representing the nature of the relationship between you and the NPC, or cap your roll at 12 if appropriate, or reverse-cap your result at 7 if appropriate:<br/><br/>13+ Allies. They help you. Because that's what friends do.<br/>10+ Positive Sum! Reveal a factor of NPC goal which aligns really well with a factor of your goal, or reveal an NPC desire that's hard for them to achieve but easy for you to facilitate, etc. Also have a nice conversation. Maybe also take +1 toward the next roll like this with this NPC if you or the GM can remember to do so.<br/>7+ Zero Sum. Offer a deal. Say clearly and directly what NPC wants. NPC is looking to cooperate but to capture most/all of the surplus.<br/>6- Negative Sum. You actually have an enemy. Why? If plausible, good. If implausible, create a misunderstanding (perhaps GM, in secret) which is difficult to root out. Maybe move to "violent conversation" mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462596/#Comment_462596" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T17:00:43+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  5:00PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Guy. Much like many of the *World "social mechanics", it encourages an interplay between the people involved, instead of establishing a mechanical back-and-forth which then allows a player to force a certain outcome in the fiction.<br/><br/>I very much like mechanics which create prompts and choices. They can be *used* by the players to create social interactions which are as adversarial or as collaborative as they like, if set up correctly.\n<blockquote><br/>If you can win or lose a conversation, someone is already being an enormous asshole, or is being manipulative and coercive, or there is a huge and relevant power imbalance between the interlocutors, or you are in some weird formalized situation such as a court of law\u2014you are already far outside the bounds of normal social interaction.<br/><br/>When the only mechanics on social interaction are relevant just to these degenerate, bizarre circumstances, it encourages us to frame all social interaction as such degenerate, bizarre adversarial bouts, which is <i>hella dumb</i> but also easy.

See, for instance, a game like Monsterhearts. I could see a more "high crunch" version of Fiasco benefiting from a similar treatment, as well.<br/><br/>Vincent Baker's games often do this in productive ways, too (with Dogs in the Vineyard being perhaps the most obvious example).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462621/#Comment_462621" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T22:26:44+00:00" title="April 28, 2017 10:26PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is true! Games are disproportionately about aggressive sociopathic assholes getting angry at each other! Especially the sort of blood opera that's the meat of so many story games.<br/><br/>One thing I like a lot about Apocalypse World's "Seduce or Manipulate" and "Go Aggro" is that they basically start "When you act like a sociopathic asshole...", which does a nice job of pointing out that these rules are not for normal social interaction, and not all social interaction uses these rules.<br/><br/>I really, really like the Bard's "Charming and Open" move from Dungeon World. When I share something true about myself, you share something true about yourself. That is awesome.<br/><br/>Sandboxy old school D&amp;D play is, I think, one style that really suffers from conflict-centric social mechanics. It nudges play in the direction of "Make a Charisma check, if you pass you don't have to fight the monster, if you fail you have to fight the monster", which is not very interesting, doesn't help me feel like I'm exploring a dangerous world or watching a complex system unfold naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
