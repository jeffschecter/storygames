That got me thinking about psychic schoolgirls and the culture they live in. It would be an odd culture indeed that has no supernatural elements, and women are particularly apt to be painted into the dark and dangerous side of the supernatural. There's the whole oppression thing, and the feminine mystique angle, none of which I'm equipped to examine in depth, all of which is interesting anyway. You have your shamans, your witches, your miko... And of course it's not all old-school. Lain from the anime Serial Experiments Lain? Totally psychic schoolgirl, born of the modern myth and horror of computers and the Web.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I want to try the shaman's daughter-preacher's daughter thing is because it expresses an interesting aspect of the Korean culture clash. Shamanism was here on the peninsula before Buddhism, before Confucianism, and of course, long before Christianity. The female shaman is very much the dominant figure in Korean shamanism, a fact that sets it apart from all the other major religions in Korea. <br/><br/>Also, there's some variation by region but it's often thought that shamanistic powers pass from the mother to the daughter (so the shaman's daughter is likely to be a "baby shaman" or "child shaman," an inexperienced shaman herself), forming a matrilineality that's strikingly different from Confucianism and Christianity in particular. Shamans also have had different sexual norms than the rest of society, particularly after Confucianist thought became the norm. All in all, the enduring shamanistic tradition forms a counterculture that coexists uneasily with Christianity, the newest hugely popular religion on the block. A child shaman and a God-fearing preacher's daughter would illustrate that kind of tension in really interesting ways. <br/><br/>Another kind of psychic schoolgirl that I think would be fun is the ghost--this is straight from the decade-old movie "Girls' Highschool Ghost Story." The quiet girl who always sits in the back is--the ghost of the girl who killed herself last year! She might not even know it herself, but she's the cause of all the weird happenings. Or maybe she should be one of the normal girls, maybe not even one of the PCs. The Lain-like character, the <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">techno-supernatual construct</span>, is another good candidate for both a psychic and ordinary schoolgirl. <br/><br/>Speaking of ghosts, the young woman's ghost is considered extra scary in our corner of the world because she died without experiencing all that life has to offer. I read that in one seaside region, the solution to the scourge of a vicious maiden specter that kept drowning young men was... dildos. No, really. The villagers carved wooden members and strung them up on a rock overlooking the ocean so that the ghost could, um, comfort herself. And it worked! No more drownings. (There's actually an old saying, "like a maiden at the market to buy a wooden prick" to refer to someone who's giggling and beating around the bush.) Now that kind of theme would be pretty cool to explore in a game of teen horror, what with the PCs having to deal with their own raging hormones and repressive social expectations. <br/><br/>You could probably get a psychic schoolgirl archetype or ten for every culture. Locales like Korea or Japan add a touch of the exotic for Westerners, but there's something supernatural in any culture. Maybe the psychic schoolgirl is the weird Wiccan girl (not Willow, probably), or the Goth girl, or the techno-music-ecstasy girl, or hell, the one from the fundamentalist family who claims that God speaks to her. Or at any rate, <i>something's</i> speaking to her... The psychic schoolgirl, when you think about it, is compelling precisely because she's so universal.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107756/#Comment_107756" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T00:19:42+00:00" title="November 11, 2007 12:19AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Part of the reason I want to try the shaman's daughter-preacher's daughter thing is because it expresses an interesting aspect of the Korean culture clash.

There are a lot of really great possibilities in a scenario like this. Just the conflict and tension between the children, their families and their religions is enough to really push some great games. Add in supernatural stuff, sex,  or any number of other issues and this just explodes!\n<blockquote><br/>Another kind of psychic schoolgirl that I think would be fun is the ghost--this is straight from the decade-old movie "Girls' Highschool Ghost Story."

I've played a few really good games centered around ghosts, my favorite ending with a girl confronting the ghost of her mother. It seems to me that games of PE that involve ghosts are more subtly creepy, while games that have actual demons are often over the top and crazy. Both ways are good, but I'd love to see more ghost stuff. Thats what I'm personally interested in.\n<blockquote>Speaking of ghosts, the young woman's ghost is considered extra scary in our corner of the world because she died without experiencing all that life has to offer.

My own Catholic school experiences give me plenty of background for it, and I can think of plenty of horrific experiences from my days in school uniform (a boys uniform admittedly) to fuel a game. Both of the schools I went to were horrible creepy places.Bizarre religious traditions and practices surrounded everything we did, and the nuns came two flavors, abusive or dismissive.<br/><br/>Most of the everyday horrors of school were present in my catholic school, and supernatural stuff is easy to add in. I remember a class project where we actually drew pictures of hell, including demons, tortured souls and all kinds of other horrible stuff. it actually seemed like we talked about demons a lot. Ghosts were all over the place as well. We where taught about about stigmata, saints and all kinds of weird supernatural stuff that nuns will go on and on about when left alone with kids. All of this would make for great supernatural games using the PE rules.<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107771/#Comment_107771" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-11T08:14:54+00:00" title="November 11, 2007  8:14AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old-school Mexican Catholicism is totally freaky.
