We are starting the recruitment early to give people plenty of time to work out their GenCon schedule, especially since event sign-up doesn\u2019t begin until April. We would like two people to work each shift and as many as want to help tear down the booth. When scheduling your time, please plan to show up 10 minutes before it starts.<br/><br/>Each volunteer should be ready to answer questions from passers-by about EN World and the ENnies. There will be a book at the booth with information such as when the ENnies ceremony will be held, the names of each judge, who the nominees are, etc. Also, some publishers may drop off materials for next years ENnies, so the volunteers will be required to have the publisher fill out a form and give the publisher a receipt. You also have to make sure nothing is taken from the booth, especially on Saturday and Sunday, after the ENnie winners are announced Friday night.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention the swag bag given to each volunteer? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>For the schedule, you can check out this link: <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AtGCQhHRRCgqdEswOWhMd2tYaFhIdTcyV05JT2M5ZGc&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AtGCQhHRRCgqdEswOWhMd2tYaFhIdTcyV05JT2M5ZGc&amp;hl=en</a><br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnies Asst.
