While I liked the lethality of the combat system, I felt that the madness meters were what really made the game tick. I thought about ways I could translate our health system into a similar metric. It didn't fly with my group (who preferred the book rules for ease), but it did inspire some ideas. Now, because I am compulsively drawn toward uniformity, I've been looking for a new metric that can encompass what I am loosely calling "Hit Points" for different things! It could truly be any metric right now. Health, social composure, mental faculty, constitution, etc. - these all fall into this discussion.<br/><br/>My question is this: what are some other ideas and mechanisms that encompass what we might call hit points? One starting point I like are the "conditions" from Mouse Guard. However, I welcome all ideas that could help!<br/><br/>Best,<br/>K.G.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387017/#Comment_387017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T20:12:04+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  8:12PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you looking for a unified metric for all conditions or are you looking for varied metrics for different conditions?<br/><br/>For <a href="http://www.steampunkfitters.com" rel="nofollow">Steampunkfitters</a>, characters have Story Point that represent their importance to the story or how much a "viewer" would expect them to continue on in the story. They work as Hit Points (physical and social) and are spendable for different effects.<br/><br/>For <a href="http://www.theartifact.net" rel="nofollow">The Artifact</a> I'm going in the opposite direction and diversifying. There are the traditional HP but there are also Stress Points in three different flavors that represent wear and tear on the characters.<br/><br/>I remember playing several games that simply used descriptors for wound levels like, strained, hurt, bleeding, dying, dead but they tend to be a little clunky to use.<br/><br/>Don't know if that was what you were looking for. . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387029/#Comment_387029" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T22:11:13+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 10:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about a HP-free hack for Dungeon World / World of Dungeons recently, since those kinds of mechanics tend to take me out of the fiction more than I really like (might be a personal thing, but I find it distracting).<br/><br/>Maybe there's a list of the kinds of bloody descriptions that The Riddle of Steel was so good at (I remember a lot of the awful ones ending with: "skull destroyed, brain destroyed"), ranked in small groups of examples by how grievous the damage is. Then, when something happens in the fiction, the GM and players just describe what happens. Say, on a 7-9: "Your sword digs into the creature's scaly hide but catches on one of the plates of its carapace. You give it a tug, but end up mostly coating your upper body in a spray of oily and putrid ichor." Boom! The GM writes some notes down about that. And then, when you score another blow on the creature, the freeform condition that the GM has noted becomes more terrible or complex (it's stabbed and on fire). Then, when the GM decides what the creature does, s/he can make decisions based on how injured the creature is and what's happened to it.<br/><br/>The same thing would work for PCs too, I think, with the only thorny point being when a character is actually too damaged or incapacitated to do anything or, even worse, dies. The way to handle this, I think, is to signal to the player a couple times before death happens, in a very "tell them the possible consequences and ask" way. Like: "Crap, that stomach wound is bleeding all over the place; you're going need to patch that up quick or you're going to loose consciousness." Or: "Shit. Yeah, it takes your arm clean off. Nothing much you can do now except lay there and try not to scream uncontrollably. Where's the cleric?"<br/><br/>This would definitely be a lot more grim and bloody than having HP, so it wouldn't work for everyone, but it would also allow for a wider range of effects than just damage, and a greater sense of trepidation and mystery, I suspect (like when you have 4 HP), because you know that you can't just soak up some damage and keep going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387032/#Comment_387032" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T22:39:33+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 10:39PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tags that give mechanical / narrative effects.
