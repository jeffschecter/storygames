Dungeons! There were other oddities that never bothered me or that I never thought to question at the time, but dungeons, ruined castles, keeps, crumbling fortresses, caverns etc. filled with an endless assortment of monsters, treasure and magic items just waiting there for no apparent reason other than to give the player characters something to do while exploring the wilderness. Dungeons were something that just never sat right with me.<br/><br/>When I was introduced to Earthdawn it made me sit up. Dungeons suddenly made sense and had a reason to exist.<br/><br/>(...)<br/><br/>It gives reasons for kaers (dungeons) to exist, for all the diabolical traps that infest them, for the creatures and treasure being in them and for them being abandoned and often in the middle of nowhere. It also gave us the Horrors, diabolical creatures that thrive and feed on the pain and suffering that they have wrought and continue to cause. The Horrors make great adversaries and power players. </blockquote>\nI don't know a lot about the Earthdawn setting but I find this very interesting.<br/>And this reminded me something I've read about the <i>Evangelion</i> tv series &amp; movies: that all the cliche's of the classic "mecha driven by young pilots who fight monsters that attack Tokyo one at a time" are somewhat explained. There's a rationale for every single element: why the pilots can be only young people; why the monsters attack always the same city; why they do that one at a time. Obviously there's a lot more than that, but it strikes me that <b>you can elaborate a setting by trying to find the rationale of a genre</b> (or subgenre).<br/><br/>On the same vein, the movie <i>The Cabin in the Woods</i> does the same thing to horror movie cliches, while I think that the <i>Scream</i> series doesn't fit in these examples because it's a little too, how can I say, post-modern (we're watching a horror movie where the characters talk about the rules of a horror movie, while in <i>The Cabin in the Woods</i> they don't).<br/><br/>Do you have other examples of this?<br/>Do you want to find a subgenre and elaborate on that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437508/#Comment_437508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-19T09:01:26+00:00" title="August 19, 2014  9:01AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lev Grossman's incredible "The Magicians" trilogy does this to the Narnia-style "portal fantasy" genre, and in the first book to Harry Potter as well.<br/><br/>And "Watchmen" is the classic example of deconstructing the superhero genre, although it's less about justifying the typical tropes than about upending them by having things develop more realistically from the same beginnings.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
