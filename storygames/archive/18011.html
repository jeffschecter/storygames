The PCs wanted to clock someone in the back of the head and knock them out without having to bring them down to 4 Harm and probably kill them. (I know that just "safely knocking someone out" in real life doesn't happen, but... )<br/><br/>Once it was a PC wanting to KO an NPC, but before we could really figure out how to resolve it, the Fae just went and killed the NPC with broken promises. (The fact that I can write the phrase "kill with broken promises" is one of the reasons I love this game).<br/><br/>Another time it was between a PC and another PC, and after some dithering, the one PC just spent a string to bribe the other PC into letting her knock her out for an XP. This worked okay but didn't really feel satisfactory. <br/><br/>So, I thought on things for a bit. Two or three times in one session indicated a possible pattern of behavior, and that yells "custom move time" to me.<br/><br/><i><b>When you clobber someone from behind</b>, and they aren't expecting it, roll +cold.<br/><br/>10+ They chose one:<br/>*They gain the "Concussed" condition.<br/>*They are unconscious and mark XP. The MC will tell them when they awake.<br/><br/>7-9 You choose one:<br/>*They take 1 Harm.<br/>*They take -1 Forward.<br/><br/>On a miss, you have left your self wide open and vulnerable.</i><br/><br/>I haven't had a chance to use the new move yet. I'll hopefully present it to my players this weekend.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406906/#Comment_406906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T00:11:57+00:00" title="February 22, 2013 12:11AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your custom move is good.

And if it's not, you've got all eyes on you waiting expectantly. That's a good time to glance at your Principles, glance at your hard moves, and then follow through on one of them.<br/><br/>If you're wondering how those Principles and Hard Moves might apply in this situation, I can give some examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406918/#Comment_406918" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T03:06:55+00:00" title="February 22, 2013  3:06AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd certainly be glad to hear some examples.<br/><br/>One of the things I was hoping to do with the "when you clobber" move was to reward the PC when they choose to put their PC in extreme danger. "You're going let Lilly knock you out? You know you could just up and kill you afterwards, right? Still okay, you say? Bold move, mark XP!" I wanted to empower the victim, as it were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407051/#Comment_407051" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T16:22:33+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  4:22PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see it being a "hold steady" move, as well, depending on the characters and the situation!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407416/#Comment_407416" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T15:26:59+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  3:26PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Despite the fact that writing up custom moves is wicked fun, thanks to feedback here and on the MH forums, I've come around the other side on this.<br/><br/>When I was writing the monster section for <i>Hobomancer</i>, I got into a debate with one of my co-writers regarding trolls turning to stone in the sunlight. He thought it should be a round-by-round process to avoid an instant kill. I argued (and won) that if the heroes can manage to trick the troll into the sun, then they deserve the instant victory. The drama comes from setting up the monster for failure. <br/><br/>It's the same situation here. The drama and challenge comes from setting up a opponent so that they are in a vulnerable position where they can bonk them in the hid or shiv them in the ribs. If the PC can orchestrate another character (an NPC at least) into such a vulnerable position, using a variety of available moves and strings, then they deserve the "instant kill."<br/><br/>For PCs, I can just use strings, like I originally did. "I'll give you an XP if you let me clobber you unconscious." My initial problem was trying to figure out how to use "emotional leverage" to explain this, but now I realize it's a matter of knowing what it would take to get this other guy to let his guard down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
