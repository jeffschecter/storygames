Unless you are totally different from us, which you are.<br/><br/>The genius of the game is the way conflicts are initiated - make strong statements until somebody objects.  No stakes.  Start out crazy strong, because your goal will be gradually attenuated, maybe down to nothing.  <br/><br/>As a player, don't be afraid to give before things get awful.  Getting your traits messed with by the victor is awful, so even when you lose hard, offer up a compromise that keeps that from happening.  Offer to sleep with his grandma or something.  <br/><br/>I've played a lot and I still have trouble keeping track of the sequence of play in conflicts.  So take that slow and make sure you are doing it right, especially the pipped dice as bonuses.  When you get those and how they are applied is a huge deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84296/#Comment_84296" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T11:43:52+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:43AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any place where all the available content for In a Wicked Age, including oracles and whatnot, is centrally linked?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84298/#Comment_84298" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T11:45:41+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:45AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inside Vincent's head.

Follow the desire you state when you're creating the situation.<br/><br/>Following from that, follow the situation generation rules (Oracle-&gt; draw out characters-&gt;choose characters-&gt; state character interests-&gt; play). These rules will give you a really great framework if you follow them closely. Resist the urge to pre-play the situation or fill it out more than the bare essentials.<br/><br/>If you're GM, you have a lot of power, but always keep in mind the story is not about your characters. One way to do constantly remind yourself that you're there to facilitate and not to Win is to be really aggressive about keeping tracking of the We Owe list. Not being on that list is a big fat flag that you're supposed to push people to action, not be the ones so pushed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84309/#Comment_84309" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T12:05:26+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 12:05PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the Owe list is really important, both tactically (when you are on it) and as a tool to see who is really engaging hard in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84313/#Comment_84313" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T12:09:58+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 12:09PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff!<br/><br/>As I understand it in the rules, the GM frames all scenes and this is his big hammer.

In other words, its like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "Ok, so the first scene is this"<br/>\nPlayer 1: "Great, my character stabs player 2's character in the throat"<br/>\nPlayer 2: "Oh no you don't!"<br/>\nGM: "Wow, I'll just sit back over here and enjoy, ok?"<br/>\n<br/>\nGM is an active participant, don't get me wrong.  But if people are in the spirit of the thing, it is often best for the GM to just roll with the conflict the players are building amongst themselves and stir the pot with periodic injections of fresh fodder for that struggle.  EDIT: Others have pretty much said this already, so consider this my "Testify, brother!"<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and in case it helps, we put an annotated copy of the rules here:<br/>\nhttp://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/InAWickedToronto:Annotated_Rules<br/>\nThat includes a lot of bits gleaned from various Forge/Anyway posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason's comment about taking it slow at first to get the conflict right is an important one.  It is confusing as all get out at first.
