It's the charter for a group I'm going to be organizing to improve everyone's GMing skills:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18EMTfrrqNA0YPDyFGnoPAeMKJMigHXyQb5zw7GNCW1k/edit" rel="nofollow">GM Guild Intro Doc</a><br/><br/>I'm really psyched about the invention of a "co-pilot". <br/></blockquote>\nI skimmed the doc, and read up on the co-pilot thing. Intense. Interesting. Probably perfect for new GMs. This is very similar to the model used in education (that is, the teaching of teachers to be good teachers), where a new/learning teacher will teach a lesson, while there is another teacher there not participating in the class, but being an attentive watcher and helper.<br/><br/>This seems really interesting. <br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/><br/>* What is the co-pilot actually, really going to do at the table?<br/>* Do they pipe in to help correct/align/help the GM right then and there? Or offer pointers during breaks? I can see the value of both.<br/>* How do you be a good and not overbearing co-pilot?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399820/#Comment_399820" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T10:46:08+00:00" title="December  6, 2012 10:46AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah, my skimming failed.

This co-pilot will give you help \u201cin the moment\u201d during breaks in the game, during your preparation for the game, and between game sessions.  They will be your immediate feedback.

Although Jason's approach has given me a new wrinkle to try.<br/><br/>I have a table of complete noobs (other than myself) and I'm running a pretty standard heroic fantasy thing in the Hellfrost setting for Savage Worlds. The minis help with tactical situations and the Bennie reward mechanic for playing your Hindrances (that is, sub-optimally) is pretty great in-game handholding.<br/><br/>I made it clear from the beginning everyone would GM something eventually, but that it would be a while. Everybody has been having an amazing time, they've really latched on in surprising ways and push the story in new and interesting directions both individually and as a group. They're growing up right and I think it has less to do with me than it does with being a group of guys who are committed to having fun with the concept.<br/><br/>Anyway, "a while" is almost up and I've got two guys on deck. They're running Hellfrost games also, using the same "instance" of the game world so that we'll each do the first four months of an in-game year every time we pass the baton. So once I pass the reins, the campaigns will happen "at the same time."<br/><br/>I planned fully to play in each of these, but I've also been doing the co-pilot thing during the first two guys' prep. I've been hand holding through general discussions of basic campaign ideas, ways to bolt on some house rules to focus the games in different ways while not learning many new mechanics, and I'll be available for chargen of course (we're doing pre-gens with input so as not to burn whole sessions on it).<br/><br/>The thing I wanted to chime in on is how easy it's been! By making it clear that GMing is something you might not love but should have in your toolbox right from the beginning, I have had zero pushback on the round robin GM plan.<br/><br/>What's more, it's been very fun to watch these guys take a kernel of an idea I had and then run with it, make it grow, and get excited about the way it morphs into something all their own. It's a very similar feeling to watching them become good players.<br/><br/>One big thing I did intuitively and just realized it when reading this thread was to suggest very differently flavored campaigns. In the one I run, they're building a new kingdom from the ground up and have their eyes on getting the noble PC on the High King's seat. In the next one, it'll be very mission based with a group of undead killers tracking a Big Bad. The other is a sorta combination exploration and survival game. The mechanics are all the same, but we're using them to do very different things, which means there won't be the immediate desire to directly compare your stuff with the next guy's stuff.<br/><br/>I also wanted to say thanks to Jason for the idea of paying that forward. I'd been planning on co-piloting everyone the first time through, but I think it'll make more sense and be more rewarding for everyone if the next round of new GMs are co-piloted by the last round of new GMs. That's pretty empowering stuff right there.<br/><br/>Jason asked me to come back here and share some experiences, and I'll do that once we start passing things around the table. Shouldn't be too long after the first of the year.<br/><br/>Great idea, Jason, if I do say so myself. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399847/#Comment_399847" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T13:44:27+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  1:44PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me of when I was asked to be a "co-GM" player, with a PC that have extremely powerful abilities to change the nature of the game world (think <i>Mage: The Ascension</i>, but I was the only Mage). In effect, I could inject conflict (PvE or PvP) in ways that surprised the actual GM, or in ways that helped bolster the tone the GM was setting (while he was wrestling with stats and shit--this was <i>Champions</i>).<br/><br/>I've also see team GMs, mainly in events where "splitting the party" was a given for the scenario (<i>every</i> LARP I've ever played in or helped to run, or course, but also in tabletop games).<br/><br/>Hell... the whole GM-role paradigm has been so splintered by modern design that it could be done by any number of players, whether or not they play characters, too.

If you don't ever want someone to say "that didn't work" or "not a good idea" or "not cool", then this setup would NOT work for you.<br/><br/>If you just want people to only ever say "that thing you did was good", then this setup would not work.  It is all about feedback: twice per session from the co-pilot and at the end of the campaign, from everyone, in detail, good and bad.<br/><br/>So if your main issue with GMing is that you feel nervous about doing it, this will not help.  If your main issue is that you feel nervous about doing it BADLY this will definitely help.  And of course if you're overconfident in your abilities (like me) and just want to get better because even Michael Jordan had to practice a shitload of basketball, this is perfect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399881/#Comment_399881" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T19:06:19+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  7:06PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS did I just invent the new new honesty....FOR GAME <i>PLAY</i>?!?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399883/#Comment_399883" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T19:35:56+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  7:35PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno my friends usually are rather open with the feedback and discussion.

The other has the job: "Advocate for the PCs."<br/><br/>So one advises and helps remind the PCs where they can get bonuses or use a certain power. The other is free to play the "bad guys" (or whatever) at full tilt and tries to screw over the PCs at every step of the way.<br/><br/>Of course, it would need an appropriate system to support this kind of play, but it seems like it could have some potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399894/#Comment_399894" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T21:36:07+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  9:36PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, criticism and improvement is all nice and good.

I would *looooooove* to serve in this capacity.<br/><br/>Also, the MH game I play in has two co-MCs, and they more or less function as you describe, trading off the lead and secondary roles.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399895/#Comment_399895" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T21:38:33+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  9:38PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2012 9:39PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tapping in is a cool idea. That might be something that the GM and co-pilot work out in advance.  I'll put it on the list of things for GMs and co-pilots to work no together.  I agree, breaking to brainstorm is cool. (I am also taking some of the pressure to perform off here by scheduling a mandatory break in every game session specifically for GM/copilot collaboration.)<br/><br/>I have also heard of that authority division idea but never gotten it past the drawing board. If I get a group that's really dedicated to the "troupe" game idea, that might be something I might try to do.<br/><br/>Again, really, this is not an idea specifically for brand-new GMs (despite Andy's thread title, which, er, I just kind of noticed now I READ STORY-GAMES FOR THE ARTICLES OKAY). There may be some overlap with that group but it's more for "GMs who want to improve". If you're just trying to get walking, some guy standing there with a stopwatch is not going to be that helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399899/#Comment_399899" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T22:21:56+00:00" title="December  6, 2012 10:21PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD - lol!<br/><br/>Matt,<br/><br/>I want to hear more about the MH co-MCs!
