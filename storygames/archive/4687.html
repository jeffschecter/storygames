Even the original publisher did about 4 versions, more if you count 2300AD etc.<br/><br/>RQ is similar. It started out at Chaosium, went to Avalon Hill for version 3, then became Hero Wars and Hero Quest (after the board game folded) with Issaries Inc. Now Mongoose are doing a version using rules more like RQ2. And Games Workshop had a licence for RQ too and reprinted the Avalon Hill material with a few slight changes.<br/><br/>John Kim possibly has the best list of roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106793/#Comment_106793" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T12:23:03+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 12:23PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, even in my limited experience of the game, different editions of <i>Traveller </i>used radically different mechanics and significantly different settings.

Marc Miller's own publishing imprint is Far Future Enterprises.<br/><br/>Several other folks have a license (or had) a license to publish "versions" of Traveller:<br/><br/>- Mongoose (for a new version of Traveller, which Marc intends to be "the basic game", as far as I know)<br/>- Steve Jackson Games (for GURPS Traveller)<br/>- ComStar Games (for Traveller HERO)<br/>- Quick Link Interactive/RPG Realms (for the D20 version of Traveller, Traveller20)<br/>- Far Future Enterprises (for all GDW versions of Traveller, T4, and the upcoming T5, which Marc intends to be "the advanced game", as far as I know)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
