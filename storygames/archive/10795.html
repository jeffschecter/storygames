The issues there revolve around distractions at the table, engaging players, and useful tools for complex mechanics. And that has lead my mind to...<br/><br/>Gaming online. I don't do it and I don't want to do it. One of the joys of playing these games and sharing these stories with people is being able to sit across from a real person and interact with them. They get to see me laugh and cry and be wowed and I get to see the same from them. Then as a bonus, we get to check up on each other outside of the game. "How are you doing? How did your job interview go? I know someone who can help you out! You should come by for stew later. Yeah, lets go to the farmer's market on sunday." ETC... This is a good thing for humans to do, and I believe that it strengthens our communities (not just the gaming ones, but the ones we live in) and improves our social skills.<br/><br/>I realize that a lot of people seem to have no other option but to play rpgs over Skype or Google Wave or whatever because they don't live near gamers or are far from them. Is this true? I guess that I'm lucky, as I live in Oakland and there's lots of people to game with here. But is there really no one to game with in our small towns and in the more rural areas? Isn't this a great opportunity to introduce people to gaming? We don't really need existing gamers to game with, necessarily. We can always show the people around us how cool this stuff is and see if it takes. Yeah, it's more work, but it's also more rewarding I think. <br/><br/>I think I had more to say, but I can't think of it right now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239429/#Comment_239429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T09:12:40+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  9:12AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then there's <a href="http://chattydm.net/2008/12/15/chattys-guest-playing-online-part-1-style" rel="nofollow">this guy</a> who prefers to play on-line.

In fact, this very thing alone has stalled that Tenra Bansho game by perhaps 2 years.<br/><br/>With Skype and the like, that got me thinking it was feasible. However, you will miss visual cues and the like. <br/><br/>I also have the attention span of a fruit fly. I've been in online games before, but by hour 2 I'm already checking my email, reading news articles, and only checking back into the RPG chat every 10 minutes or so.<br/><br/>I was thinking of experimenting with my PS3 with other S-Gers who have a PS3 and the PS3 EyeCam thingy, to see if that sort of thing is doable. That way I can play a one shot every now and then with my online friends that are far away, without having to wait for Gencon or other big cons. Eventually, someone will write some good PC drivers for that PS3 camera so that I can do the same with my friends via PC webcam.<br/><br/>But yeah, I'm awash in an area with so much face to face gaming going on (I have enough local folks interested that, if I could spawn two more days in the week, I would have two more weekly gaming groups), that anything online is just second best.<br/><br/>When I lived in Japan, and could only game at Tokyo gamer meetups once a month and 2.5 hours by train away (thank God for Cam Eeles and Mike Montesa for setting those up and being there), I would commonly do online gaming to supplement the rare face-to-face meetups.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239471/#Comment_239471" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T11:41:34+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 11:41AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get together with local gamers maybe once a month face to face to play board games but when it comes to story games I do it on line as play by email games.<br/><br/>Engle Matrix Games are well suited to this kind of play because most of the initial playtesting was done as play by mail. People would submit the action they wanted to have happen and I'd roll dice for which one's actually happened. The move to PBEM ten years ago allowed us to kibitz with one another during play which is a lot of fun. I think play on a forum would work well for my games but I haven't done it yet. I personally like this kind of low intensity play because I can check in on my emails periodically during the day (I'm doing psychotherapy so not doing face to face stuff is a nice change). I get a good laugh from some actions submitted and it doesn't take much time to adjudicate turns. <br/><br/>If it weren't for the type of game I play though I wouldn't play on line. Face to face is much more fun.

It's a separate thing.  Saying 'This medium does a very bad job of providing what I get from table-top gaming' is not too far different from saying 'A video game does a very bad job of providing what I get from playing Rugby.'  It is, no doubt, a true statement but it somewhat begs the question of whether you're judging video games by the right metric.<br/><br/>I like online gaming in many varieties that provide me with right-sized fun:  Some gaming to be done any time I feel like sitting down at the keyboard, and little commitment at any other time.  Skype gaming doesn't provide that, but play-by-post and play-by-email can do a good job (in exchange for its own set of problems).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239477/#Comment_239477" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T12:08:15+00:00" title="October 28, 2009 12:08PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2009 12:13PM by jessecoombs.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I guess I just don't enjoy gaming online that much and I enjoy gaming in person a whole lot more, so I'd rather do that.

And, all in all, it is my primary mode of fun from RP too. <br/><br/>But, at the same time, there are some things I enjoy about online play when its done right. I like the time and detail you can get (you'll never get the detail in moment to moment spoken description you'll get in poses you craft over time in text), the ability to break it up and do it in the middle of a day (15 minute break at work = 15 minutes of play), the interesting things you can do with intimacy of characters when intimacy of players is more removed (not just sex people, minds out of the gutter) and so on. <br/><br/>For some folks those things ring up. For others they don't. For me they don't ring up equal to a good game at the table, but they don't need to because for me it isn't one or the other its face to face when I can, and online for times in the middle of the day when I've time to drop a pose. If I had to try to use online play instead of face to face play, I'd be quite unhappy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239499/#Comment_239499" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T13:45:47+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  1:45PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ideally, I'd play face to face.

I even occasionally DO sit at a table and have fun with friends here in Louisville. Face-to-face is still my preferred way to roleplay.<br/><br/>But I roleplay most of the time these days over Skype. Not because I have few local options, choices, or compatible players with whom I enjoy socializing. I play most of the time over Skype because I WANT to roleplay with Rich Rogers and guys like Daniel Perez, Judd Karlman, Ryan Macklin and Ogre Whiteside.<br/><br/>We experience many of the less-than-desirable side-effects described above. Scheduling snafus, bad connections, missing visual cues, etc. But I'd still rather put up with that stuff than to not play (and record podcasts) with those guys.<br/><br/>Plus, in my experience, I find that with practice the side-effects become manageable*, and it isn't any more of an impediment for me than the process of gelling with a new group face-to-face, or learning a new game, or adjusting to the social issues that go along with all that.<br/><br/>So to sum up, I do it because I want to.

If you have to run to deal with something while two other people are talking, you don't miss anything, and can respond as if you were in the room if you're a quick reader: all the little life interruptions break up the narrative in real life, and you have to keep pausing or repeating/summing up for people.<br/><br/>When it's good, face-to-face roleplaying is fun in a way that online roleplaying just isn't: you get there a little early, have tea and snacks, chat about your day. You sit somewhere more comfortable than a computer chair, like a couch or the floor. I get to rest my head on my fiance's shoulder (if he's playing). I get to look at some of my favorite people while we do something fun together. There's less pressure to say something exactly the right way. You don't have to worry about whether everyone's speaking in past or present tense. Sometimes you get up and figure out how really complex actions or fights take place. There are hugs hello and goodbye.<br/><br/>People flake, it's life. I've been flaked on in both face-to-face and online games. I've had people leave in the middle of both. I've had GMs sleep through and miss both.<br/><br/>Edited to be less ranty. I will say this much, though, as regards the crap about how playing face-to-face makes us better, more social people or whatever.<br/><br/>I had a roommate who was kind of a big oaf. Nice guy, loved to roleplay. Very creative, but not very good at putting together his thoughts-- the kind of guy who'd have a great plan if someone needed busting out of jail, but if he had to use his considerable charisma score he'd just say "I make a really awesome speech" and roll the dice. We started playing online together after he moved away. Three months of online play and he was totally thrilled at how much easier it had become for him to actually speak in character, to know what was going on in his character's head and what that character would actually say. It also made writing up papers in college (why he moved away in the first place) a hell of a lot easier, as he was more comfortable defending his opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239546/#Comment_239546" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T20:09:07+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:09PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a few good experiences with online gaming, but I far prefer tabletop if possible. <br/><br/>Usually if I don't anyone to face to face with I'll play a video game, or do something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley" title="MickBradley"><img alt="MickBradley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.canonpuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/mick-blackhat1001.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MickBradley">MickBradley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239549/#Comment_239549" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T20:28:44+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:28PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ditto everything Elizabeth wrote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239550/#Comment_239550" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T20:37:11+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:37PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy Skype gaming because it fits more easily in my life schedule and gives me a wide net to cast for good gamers and I don't have to evangelize indie games to some dudes at the FLGS.

Having everyone together in one place wouldn't have changed any of that. Career, relationships, these things take priority over gaming and my friends would kick my ass if I put gaming first.<br/><br/>I can understand that some people game better over online. There's more time to think, more time to choose words. Many people play better with that extra few seconds, play more boldly when hidden behind a screen, and it's certainly more fun to play with them when they're at their best. At the same time, I can't dance across the floor with them, I can't share a meal with them, and I miss that.

This is <i>precisely</i> one of the ways online gaming can be completely superior to tabletop."<br/><br/>I said:<br/><br/>There are a lot of friendly people willing to playtest something on a slow night on IRC. I mean, I live in Indie Game Central (Western MA) and I'm still going to be doing a lot of my playtesting on IRC simply because it's so easy and the people there give great feedback. When I was playtesting It's Complicated, we'd run a two-hour game and then pick apart what worked and what didn't for an extra hour, and then I'd have a log of the entire thing. The game, the OOC chatter, AND the post-mortem. It was so incredibly useful. I playtested that thing between 1-5 nights a week for a year, and of those, only three playtests had ever been in person: and those were at cons.<br/><br/>Never tried Skype, though. It seems like it would be closer to tabletop, which is interesting, but then you lose the super useful logs. Hmm.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Those logs were golden. I could have tape-recorded face-to-face sessions, I guess, but if someone was sitting too far from the mic or everyone was watching what they said because there was a tape recorder out or I couldn't understand what someone was saying, it'd suck. But even if all of that was crystal clear.. If I wanted to post any of it in text form, I'd have to transcribe it, which would suck. Likewise, it wouldn't be searchable by word or phrase. The final playtests at cons were to ensure it didn't run too differently from online, that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239987/#Comment_239987" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-01T07:52:40+00:00" title="November  1, 2009  7:52AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, as someone who has done audio-recorded games for study at university, I wish I'd thought of that.

In other words, do things you learn online still apply in face-to-face gaming and vice-versa?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240015/#Comment_240015" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-01T14:35:26+00:00" title="November  1, 2009  2:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, for sure. The main difference is that things go much slower online than they do in person: online, a group could get through one round of It's Complicated in roughly the same amount of time it's taken to get through the whole board in person. If mechanics are broken, you'll find out from either type of play-- if anything, playtesting online is superior because the only way to communicate the rules is <i>through text.</i> If something in the playtest doc wasn't clear or needed more explaining, I'd clarify or expand in chat, and that would get copied, pasted, and edited into the text of the game that night. There's none of the problem of playtesting the designer's vision or intent <b>instead of</b> the product as it is written. The text isn't written from the standpoint of "play the game and write down what we did," as that can lead to a text that doesn't jive with the experience at all, but instead you play the game as written and then compare that to your goals.<br/><br/>It also reduced the production time of the game, because the text was mechanically bulletproof when the game came out of playtest-- it wasn't "Great, I've got the mechanics solid, now I just need people to playtest the text." Writing and revising happened simultaneously, which for certain made for a better text.<br/><br/>Some games wouldn't benefit from online playtesting in the same way-- Mist-Robed Gate, for example, with its wordless entreaties and knife ritual. You <i>could</i> play it online, but you'd want to test the visceral impact of the physicality of the game before it went to print. I wouldn't ever suggest only playtesting a game online, due to pacing issues and if your game has any visceral, physical components, but I think 80-90% of playtesting can be done online to the betterment of your game and the ease of implementation. It does take a couple of things to make it work well though: <br/><br/>You have to have a playable text done before the first playtest.<br/>You have to update that text after every session and get it back to your playtesters before the next session.<br/>You have to be willing to stay up late if that's when people are around and eager to play.<br/><br/>If you're willing to do those things, online playtesting is amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
