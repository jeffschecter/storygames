I'd already established that he had a thing for the local hardholder, a woman named Amy, so he seemed a fairly typical biker type and I was happy with that.<br/><br/>Enter FigureFour's character, Barbarossa.  He's a Gunlugger with a big, beefy body and piggy eyes.  Not anyone's idea of a looker.  And when he was asked who in the group he thought was the prettiest... he picked Hammer.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, after a night of drinking mushroom spirits and getting rough and tumble in a dive bar, Hammer and Barbarossa ended up getting rough and tumble with <i>each other</i>.  We had just introduced gay biker sex into the game.<br/><br/>The thing is this: neither I nor Barbarossa's player are gay and until the moment Barbarossa chose Hammer as the prettiest, the character wasn't defined as homosexual \u2014 or bisexual, as the case may be.  That all came out of the game fiction and developed sort of at odds with our personal tastes.  It was an example of something discomfiting and out of place for the <i>players</i> happening because it made for better character.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying gay biker sex is the only way this kind of thing can come up.  I've talked about, in other threads, playing unrepentant Nazis and terrorists, people totally at odds with the average gamer's outlook.  There's something satisfying about going against the grain from time to time (not all the time) and making up something that ordinarily you wouldn't just because it makes the game deeper or more resonant or just plain memorable.<br/><br/>I'm curious about other people's experience introducing borderline character traits, events or what have you into a game.  How did it come about?  Was it a deliberate choice on your part to put a toe (or a whole foot) over the line?  How did it go over?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245352/#Comment_245352" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T08:32:46+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  8:32AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At my very first Camarilla gathering, my wife (who's relatively new to gaming) had a steamy lesbian interlude (in character!) with another vampire played by a colleague of hers at the university where we both work. After about 90 seconds of uncontrollable shaking, I decided that it was cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245363/#Comment_245363" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T10:01:34+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 10:01AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for the record, I'm Barbarossa's player.<br/><br/>I think it's worth noting that the game mechanics really drove my decision to seduce Hammer. After I picked him as who Barbarossa thought was prettiest AND smartest, it was pretty clear to me that he had a massive man crush on Hammer. However, my intent was to keep that a secret, right up until someone highlighted my Hot attribute and stuck me in a bar with Hammer during an opening scene. (If you haven't played Apocalypse World, a highlighted Hot score means that I get points towards character advancement by seducing people.)<br/><br/>That said, obviously I made a deliberate choice there. It seemed like it would add an interesting level of depth to the relationship between Hammer and Barbarossa, so I figured it would be cool to get it out in the open. However, the gradual step by step introduction of the idea and the mechanics pushing it definitely helped me get to the point where I'd actually try to roll to seduce another PC. Right up until that moment, I had always thought that sex in an RPG was creepy and tasteless. Frankly, with my terrible Hot score, I didn't think it would happen even if I rolled, so even with all that coaxing, it took the dice beating the odds to make it happen. I think if we had gotten to that point and the MC had asked "So do you two have sex?" without a roll, we both would have said no.<br/><br/>However, I'm actually pretty glad we beat the odds there, because it turned out really interesting. It did result in a very cool relationship between our characters and because we were mature about it (and probably because we weren't playing face to face) it was awkward for the characters, but not really for the players.<br/><br/>So for me that was a sort of a "holy shit" moment of realization that intra-character sex could actually work FOR a game, not against it and I think the fact that it was pretty far over the line for me (I play with my girlfriend, and even the thought of proposing hetero sexual sex with her character would be over the line) really emphasized the point that when handled maturely, leaving your comfort zone in a game can be pretty fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245369/#Comment_245369" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T11:00:10+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 11:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2009 11:28AM by Cedric P.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our last two players game of Hero's Banner, I played a noble lady and the other player played my brother in law. We shared some common NPC, but even so, at some point our two storyline where starting to go in parallel direction. So I decided to have a affair with the other player character to bring back our storyline together. At first I was not too certain about it, but we used veils and we felt safe to play out our character romance. We avoided any uncomfortable descriptions, but still, it was fun to roleplay. It waved our characters story together, and for my part I dint felt any downtime during the scene where my character was absent since I was really interested in the fate of her love interest. [EDIT: note, I had a character goal related to Love, one of her believe was: "Love can't be forced, my Love must be free". It also helped me to take this decision, since I wanted to gather Passion points.]<br/><br/>In the end, there was a opportunity where my character could have been pregnant with the other character child (by creating a new link after a dice roll), but I dint take it.<br/>After the game I felt like I had let pass a interesting opportunity. I think at the moment of decision I was kind of afraid to push too much our characters relation (that it was "fusing" our characters too much) or that doing so was maybe imposing something too important on the other character story so I backed off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
