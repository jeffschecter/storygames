I've requested the Saturday late afternoon (4-8) slot. Here's the pitch:\n<blockquote>The time is March, 1954. The investigators are American sailors and scientists aboard the aircraft carrier <i>USS Bairoko</i> during the "Castle Bravo" hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific Ocean. After the ship sails through a cloud of radioactive fallout, strange events occur. What eldritch monstrosity has been awakened by atomic fire, and can the investigators save the ship from its unearthly designs?</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20S.%20Miller" title="Michael S.
