So, here it goes (for some reason my italics have all vanished and I can't seem to get them back, so no emphasis in this one):<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue of prep is one that I never really struggled with much in my gaming past. When I first started rolling polyhedrons in 1993, it was enough to have some general baddies and some locations in mind, and then just run with that. If people needed more specifics, then you drew a map on a piece of scrap paper. We were just kids, and playing superheroes in the 90s, so most of our problems were solved by judicious application of firepower anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I aged and changed systems, the prep issue came more to the forefront. I remember being asked by a group of guys in university what the floorplan of the building they were going to go into looked like, and where the sprinklers were, and things like that. Now, granted, they had just been playing too much Rainbow Six, and we were able to work out our differences, but it was the beginning of a change.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext up was my first time running Shadowrun. This would've been around late-1999 or early-2000, so whatever edition was current at the time. I was running a pre-published adventure and had done basically zero prep, so how surprised was I when things ground to an utter halt because I didn't know the hardness ratings of building materials or how to apply certain weapon rules when the big climactic battle hit. I hadn't done my homework, and the game suffered because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter Dungeons and Dragons, specifically the third edition of that venerable game. I had mostly avoided D&amp;D during my gaming youth due to the bizarre and annoying mechanics involving THAC0 and reducing AC, but due to a shake-up in my gaming group, and a perceived lack of quality alternatives for fantasy RPing (which was in our blood, being that the first Lord of the Rings movie was out), I picked up the D&amp;D3E core books at the Friendly Local Game Store.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lo, I entered a world I had not been ready for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a pretty slapdash gamemaster. I make things up on the fly, improvise, and I like to have a list of names at hand so I can quickly throw an NPC in the mix and at least they have a name, even if they have nothing else. I like to be able to have the players wander into a room and be confronted with some ancient horror that can be reasoned with or battled or whatever. But D&amp;D... well... it wants you to know what's behind that door before anyone even rolls a listen check.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith 20 levels of play, and an intricate "challenge rating" system, D&amp;D was structured towards a person who would sit down and craft a fine adventure beforehand. My game was giving me homework! I'd have nothing of it, and left the running of D&amp;D to other hands, hands more willing to spend an hour in prep for four at the gaming table. Leave me my slapdash "storytelling" games where I could sit down with a list of names, a list of locations, and a vague idea about spider-like demons from beyond the Fifth Veil that were stealing babies that had the spark of magic to raise them as their own pawns, and then letting the fangs and fur and forces-magic fly. To make your players fight a dragon in D&amp;D, you needed to have the right book, the right dice, and reference a page-long block of stats. To throw a dragon into my games, I would just say "Is 12 dice the right amount of damage? Yeah, seems to be. If I want to make it tougher I'll just bump it to 14 dice".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we have a fourth edition of D&amp;D, which I love in a lot of ways. I like how they have scaled back the detail on all the crap that doesn't matter, and given each character a specific role in the party, so everybody knows from the outset what they are getting into. People complain that it's too MMO-like, but there's a reason MMOs are successful: they simplify thing enough that people don't have to exhaust themselves playing. But... MMOs also turn all the number-crunching and encounter design over to teams of writers and designers who make things work and then let them run on autopilot. MMOs don't need a gamemaster. D&amp;D still does.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the prep is still there. I love 4E's encounters. I like how they feel balanced and tactical and intense. I love that they almost always end up as close calls with one player making death checks and the others pulling through only because of some lucky rolls. I love them, but I HATE designing them. I hate sitting down for an hour before a game session to come up with a balanced mix of monsters at the appropriate level for my party and then picking out magical gear that the party can use. I suspect the GM tools from D&amp;D Insider would be a huge boon to me, but I've already spent $75 on the corebook set (thank you Amazon) and there's no way I'm paying a subscription fee on top of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo way I am spending 1/5 of my time with a game system "preparing". Not when there are lots of perfectly enjoyable games on the market that lend themselves to my style.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll happily play in a game of D&amp;D. If you're running it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199726/#Comment_199726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T12:01:05+00:00" title="March 31, 2009 12:01PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm SOOOO with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's a couple of things that has me interested in running some 4E despite feeling the exact same way as you about prep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf folks go into the game with something of an MMO mindset, as opposed to "Its roleplaying we can do anythings..." then running a prepublished module is pretty easy.  The maps are already drawn (and a breeze to set up if you have dungeon tiles, otherwise, a bit of in session prep to draw it up on a big chessex erasable mat) the monsters and all of their relevant powers are already there...AND the tactics for using those monsters and powers effectively are written up right in the encounter.  About the only prep you have to do is refresh yourself on the mechanics because 4E is a game that does rely on some precision implementation of certain key words...like what exactly is a Shift and what exactly is the mechanical difference between Dazed and Stunned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I like is that all of the monster writeups (in the MM or Open Grave or what have you) already have sample encounter groups worked up.  So if you want to know what sort of minions a Brain in a Jar is likely to have...just flip to the Brain in a Jar write-up...and it helpfully tells you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you could run it...if you're willing to run modules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199733/#Comment_199733" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T12:10:50+00:00" title="March 31, 2009 12:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Valamir: Thanks for the first comment! I guess my issue with that would be that modules tend to give me headaches because they are generally such nonsense and don't generally tie back to the PCs' motivations. I guess I could always go through the module and make small adjustments so that the PCs aren't tramping through the dungeon because Lord X told them to but because it ties into their backstory... but then I'm paying module prices for a few maps and statblocks.<br><br>An interesting exception to my prep rules, though, is <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. I love prepping towns for <i>Dogs</i>. I guess it's because all I'm doing is writing down pages of plot hooks and then letting the shit hit the fan (can I say shit?

As long as the monsters are roughly the correct level (within the correct tier essentially ) as long as you don't futz the Xperiance total for the encounter they should be fine. You don't have to balance the encoutners to make them work, althought you certainly may want to make them kick more ass (which can totally be done in your slapdash manner, if your fight is boring, spice it up, if its grinding, end it, etc.)<br/><br/>Try taking a bunch of monsters and their xp values, and page references put them on slips of paper. Put papers in bowel, draw randomly, until you get arround the xp total you want, which is clearly defined by the level and number of players you got.   While this will definitely take some set up once, it works fine from there on in with no time invested.  (This is covered a bit in the random dungeon and Dmless play in the 4th dmg but its a small section , that makes it seem like a lot more work than it is (or at least that you can get away with )<br/><br/><br/><b>Picking out magical gear that the party can use. </b><br/><br/>Make the party do that, that's what wishlists are for. <br/><br/><b>The Tool's etc. </b><br/><br/>That subsrciption you were lamenting includes dungeon/dragon magazine (also known as getting something besides what you already paid for) as well as the compendium which can make the monster thing even easier, (draw monster, search compendium , play) its not for everyone but honestly if you think it would help you, why don't you look at it (try it even) rather than going on about 'paying for something i already bought' which is more or less not the way it is. <br/><br/>I love prep as well, and honestly, I've been spending more time cleaning house for dnd day, than say building encounters, sorting out treasure, or planning story game goodness. <br/><br/>Just some thoughts , hope they help.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199769/#Comment_199769" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T14:33:35+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  2:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">modules tend to give me headaches because they are generally such nonsense and don't generally tie back to the PCs' motivations</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nWell shoot, Adam, when I want that I play something else ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your players' D&amp;D; character's motivations include something more than a reason to kill things and take their stuff, they're really over thinking things...&lt;bg&gt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199770/#Comment_199770" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T14:35:39+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  2:35PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Logos 7: I'm digging the "monster out of a hat system".

We'd play after work on a Thursday. At work, I'd loosely brainstorm ides. Not commit to anything, just try to think of interesting stuff while walking to lunch or whatever. After work I'd grab dinner and flip through the MM, picking out a few monsters I wanted to use. Then I'd show up to the game and improvise my head off.<br/><br/>And it worked.<br/><br/>I actually had one player, after a session I completely improvised, tell me I should submit the adventure to Dungeon.<br/><br/>The key for me was to have an idea of the stats of a few monsters of the proper level and then just describe them however I wanted. The plot had a lot of giants that were generally 'boss' type fights, so I just used dragon stats. The giant smith was a red dragon. The storm giant diplomat was a blue dragon. The game was around 4-6th level, so I just took the stats available to me, made sure I knew the basics of them, and then described them however.<br/><br/>So, to me, 4E is an improv game. The encounters are simple enough to build and the stat blocks are quick enough to read that I could just pull out something and play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199837/#Comment_199837" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T20:01:34+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  8:01PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 8:03PM by madunkieg.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can understand the desire to avoid prep work. There are certain kinds of prep work I hate to do (like planning encounters) and certain types I love to do (like designing meaningful problems). If your story starts to drift beyond the scope of D&amp;D4e's pre-designed resources and mechanics, the amount of prep work you have to do goes up dramatically because you have to build it all, from the world scale to the details. Since 4e is a bit more focused (aka limited) in its resources than 3e, you hit this pretty quick because you're used to having more there to support you.<br/><br/>My full opinion on all this would be rather inflammatory, so I'll just say that I don't like this direction in game design and have opted instead to spend my money on other games that provide a wider range of ideas, mechanics and resources to work and play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199842/#Comment_199842" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T21:06:27+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  9:06PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite><br/>The key for me was to have an idea of the stats of a few monsters of the proper level and then just describe them however I wanted. </blockquote>\nAlthough I enjoy prepping for a game (and I spend way more than one hour) I find that this trick can be a great tactic. The players will never know the difference, and it works out great for you too, especially in 4th edition where things are more focused on the elements of game play and monsters aren't a list of random spell like abilities and arbitrary stats (not that that's a bad thing, but it's counter intuitive to freeform play)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mule" title="Mule"><img alt="Mule" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mule">Mule</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199867/#Comment_199867" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-01T01:55:50+00:00" title="April  1, 2009  1:55AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm doing some 4th Ed DMing and am struggling with prep issues as well.  I've found that using the stats of the stuff in the Monster's Manual as the engine for things I cover in my own bells and whistles actually doesn't work as well as I expect (from experience with previous editions) because it feels like the monster designers did a very good job integrating the "fluff" and feel of monsters into their stat blocks and power lists.<br/><br/>What's really killing me right now though is terrain prep.  I can just pick out a few monsters from the Monster Manual and scribble down the stats beforehand, maybe an hours prep per week and I'm cool with that, but a lot of D&amp;D4's tactics are movement and terrain based, so the amount of thought put into terrain features actually makes a significant difference in how the game plays.<br/><br/>It feels like I'm flailing around in the dark; I can spend an hour or more trying to come up with terrain I think will be cool, and then it ends up actively detracting from play.  It really tempts me to go back to just having everything take place in square rooms connected by short hallways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200171/#Comment_200171" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T13:46:08+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  1:46PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>... but what about maps/interesting environments? </blockquote>\nI usually make up the map as I'm drawing it out on the battlemat.

DDI insider is a great help in doing that.  I'm looking at some pre-fabbed encounters, the map I want to use and saying "nah, 4 of those guys don't work so much, will be too crowded, need to meet the XP budget with fewer critters -call up DDI and run search for creatures of right role and level range, hmm, dwarven mercenaries here, so keyword dwarf, and bang there's the list from MM, modules, RPG modules etc. - pull down the ones I want cut and paste and off we go. <br/><br/>As noted above, terrain prep takes more work ~ would be great if DDI had that content as well. I've been keeping my own master file of features from modules etc.  to help quickly stock encounter areas from trees to tables.<br/><br/>All of that said, for any game like this to DM I think you need to enjoy prep in itself to some degree.  It still can't require too much of it, but if prep is a chore I don't think a system like this works unless you use prewritten modules.  If you can improvise it, great, but I think the tactical aspects of the game require some thought to keep fully in play (I can't count the number of times actually putting a space down on a battlemat and looking at it makes me realize d'oh something about the encounter).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
