                    Please start discussing chapter two. I got behind getting ready for the first night of My Life with Master. ( I am in part 5)<br/><br/>What are the things we can do, in our games, to get people to build the trust needed to share things which are closer to their soul? i ask because in making the master last night whenever we veered toward anything really meaty as a group we would pull back and water it down. I spent the whole week thinking  "what if the stuff I do to them isn't  icky enough" now I'm thinking the opposite. I will try to be obvious. <br/><br/>Waht are the things we can do to help people to go with the obvious. My first thougth is to limit the amount of time people get to decide. But that pressure sometimes makes people choke, which is not what we want.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>

<blockquote>Waht are the things we can do to help people to go with the obvious. My first thougth is to limit the amount of time people get to decide. But that pressure sometimes makes people choke, which is not what we want.</blockquote>
For me, this thing about being obvious is <i>incredibly</i> useful in roleplaying.<br/><br/>The way I see this working is: when deciding what your character does, you should do the thing that seems really obvious. That thing that you think is obvious will seem incredibly creative to everyone else.<br/><br/>For example, let's say we're playing My Life With Master. I'm a gravedigger charater and my master has told me to kill an old man. It seems to be <i>incredibly</i> obvious that I should entice him into the graveyard, creep up behind him with a shovel and whack him into an open grave. <br/><br/>But that's actually quite a creative idea. Other people reading this will have different "obvious" ideas and, to me, their ideas will probably seem verycreative.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I also noticed that in making the master we kept turning away from what we wanted bucause "It was too cliched". After reading this I think that it might have been the best choice.                        </div>

                            They could be quite specific, I suppose, like "I'm going to make sure you get a chance to deepen your feud in a scene with Chu Fa Chien" or something.  Or it could be very broad, like "I'm going to make sure you get plenty of spotlight time tonight".  It should really be about what you know they want and need, but I suppose your choice does reflect on your own interests as well.                        </div>

                            I was wondering if the Spontaneity stuff could be directly related to "I will not abandon you" play.  In retrospect it obviously can.  Hardcore improv is all about trusting your scene partners so you can push boundaries.  In that way my "make you awesome" game could be seen as a sort of reinforcement of that notion, if you played IWNAY style.                        </div>

                            Matt, I think you hit the nail on the head with this...
<blockquote>"You don't know what to do? What's the first thing that comes into your mind?"</blockquote>
And, you too, Thor, with this...
<blockquote>I also noticed that in making the master we kept turning away from what we wanted bucause "It was too cliched". After reading this I think that it might have been the best choice.</blockquote>
And I'll do another post about the "Let's all support each other" thing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            So...this thread has gone quickly down the "Let's support each other during play" route. And I'm totally behind that. Of course, it's necessary to create a supportive atmosphere, it's very important. <br/><br/>But I don't think it's connected to spontaneity very much. For example, Jason, in your Awesome drill, you say:
<blockquote>Joel: I'm going to take every opportunity to force An Gao into situations where he can earn XP. That means revenge, the clan, I'm on it.</blockquote>
Now, that's great, but it doesn't sound very spontaneous. This implies you're <i> planning</i> to force him into situations and <i>thinking</i> about situations to force him into. If we're talking about spontaneity, there shouldn't be thinking at all.<br/><br/>If you were going to be spontaneous, you'd have to say:<br/><br/><i>Joel, I have no idea what I'm going to do this evening. I'm just going to react on the spur of the moment and say the first thing that comes into my head. That might help An Gao earn XP, it might not. We won't know until it happens.</i><br/><br/>I realise I'm slightly twisting your point. But do you see where I'm going? Being supportive and being spontaneous don't always go together. <br/><br/>In fact, being spontaneous can stop you being supportive, because if you <i>really</i> say the first thing you think of, it could offend everyone else at the table.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>[Edited to delete a chunk at the end, because I was going into "improv bollocks" mode]<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            You're absolutely right, and there is the potential for a real dichotomy there.  Maybe it can't be avoided.  <br/><br/>In Joel's case, I have no idea how I'll "help" him, but it will almost certainly be in ways that damage his character's health and prospects for a happy tomorrow.  I think I can make an argument that my commitment to making Joel look good will result in some spontaneous actions on my part as the session progresses.  But they won't be truly spontaneous, since I'll be looking for those moments.  <br/><br/>Do you think "spontaneity" as Johnstone defines it is even possible in a roleplaying setting?                        </div>

                            In rpg you are constantly using and incorporating stuff that has already been agreed upon, so technically, no it's not spontaneous per se. But on the other hand, you have to use those elements in novel ways all the time, so you are forced to think on your feet. Games that open the background &amp; plot up to the whole group especially deal with this.                        </div>

                            Jason - I absolutly think that first thing that comes to mind is both possible and enjoyable, I don't always think that it is going to get you into the best position vis-a-vis long term goals. <br/><br/>The two things that might make what we are doing different from what Johnstone is, are first that we are engaging in a longer term improvisations and we are not as into "funny" as he seems to be. <br/><br/>I don't think that either of these things is a stopper, but we need to keep them in mind with regard to spontenaity. I make spontaneous decisions that affect my long term goals all the time (that they never work out should be telling me something) but will often agonize over the actions of my character to the point of inaction (it is a joke in my group that "UM, UM, UM" is me taking the blow in Dogs). <br/><br/>If anyone has a chance we should try to get a short game where you always do the first thing that comes to mind.<br/><br/>Grahm you do some LARPing, does the feeling of spontenaity  feel different when live?                        </div>

                            Clinton, Remi, and I have an insidious, long-term plan to get the hardcore improvisers we're meeting to try out our games.  Some of the people I play with are not quick on their feet - they can create great stuff but spontaneity is not one of their strengths.

Yeah, totally, that's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about.<br/><br/>For me, there's two messages that you <i>could</i> take away from this chapter:<br/><br/>1. Don't try to be clever. Sometimes the first idea that comes into your head is the best one.<br/>2. Provoke people! Fire questions at them! It'll push your play into new and weird directions!<br/><br/>Now, I think the first one's a good point for everyone.<br/><br/>The second one really depends on your style of play. It's only a good idea if you <i>like</i> this style of play. Many people won't. I wouldn't like it all the time.<br/><br/>[Interesting wanky improv point, mainly for Jason. There's a major difference between the Johnstone style of doing improv and the Truth In Comedy / Chicago style.<br/><br/>The Johnstone style encourages questions that provoke the other player to answer (such as "What's the flaw in the enemy's plan?"), on the grounds they force the other player to answer, and that makes them spontaneous.<br/><br/>The Chicago style discourages questions, on the grounds that they make the other player do the work.]<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I really want to move on to story but I don't think that we have completely run the course on spotenaity. On of the things that Johnstone says in the next chapter is that when asking for word at a time stories that there is a progression from funny to sexual to religious to vulnerable and lonely. <br/><br/>I am much newer to the Narr play than most of the rest of my group, and I wanted something lighter for my first MLWM game. I was joking about doing MY Life with Bush. All of the minions where minor secretaries trying desperately to make the country a better place and the president being this tyrant with his own agenda. (we are a very liberal group) i realise that it was a mistake because it set a funny tone that some others liked and some didn't. long story short after 20 masters we finally went with the one we all disliked the least. I thinmk that if i hadn't made the joke we would have finished a lot faster. <br/><br/>what you may ask is he ranting about, I was wondering if we should plan for a group to go through those stages with a new game?                        </div>

                            Having played the story game in various versions many times, I think this may be one of the areas in which Johnstone oversteps.  Or perhaps this progression is a unique window into the English mind.  I've never seen a religious theme emerge, not once.  Funny and sexual, yes, and perhaps occasionally something more serious.                        </div>

                            My point is, that a game like InSpectres supports humorous play and will still be able to grow into serious play very easily. I'm pretty sure that Paul wanted MLWM to be played as strait as possible and to get at some hardcore feelings. It might have been a better game if there was a get the funny out of your system note. No, i take that back, it would still be the same great game that it is but it might have been less intimidating.<br/><br/>EDIT: Kit got the Roach this week, If I had known that I would have opted for itover MLWM because it seems to have both possible play states. or rather, Roach seems to do both at once. which to my mind may be the perfect option.                        </div>

                            Jason, yeah, you're right. I think I've only seen that progression in <i>written</i> word at a time stories, not spoken ones. I wonder why?<br/><br/>Thor, just out of interest, why did you bring "humorous" into this? Improv isn't necessarily aimed at funny stories.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Johnstone keeps coming back to the laughing, "we do X... everyone was laughing". I understand that there is no direct link between the two, but Johnstone sees it as a stage in the progress of comfort, and I think that it is something we have forgotten because we have outgrown the need. <br/><br/>I think there is something to be gained from a game which can be played for laughs in the first couple sessions, when things go wrong anyway. If the game had a built in progress from light material to heavy so much the better. There might be some people who aren't ready, when they first play a game, to put all of their emotions out front.                        </div>
