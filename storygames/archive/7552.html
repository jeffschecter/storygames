Everyone'd actually made characters without knowing what system we'd wind up using, and there was a lot of mail to go through and info to assemble into R-maps and the like - so I was halfway through preparing for yesterday's game when I discovered that uhhh... I'd planned for a GM'ed campaign, and Archipelago has no GM. And I had no character.<br/><br/>I decided to test what it would like to facilitate a GM-less game, and participated without playing a character. As all players can do in Archipelago, I created destiny points for other characters, ran NPCs in their stories, called out "Draw a card!", suggested actions, described environment... I was very much in the game. However, it didn't really click; I wasn't <i>there</i> in the fiction, I didn't smell the smells and taste the tastes. I assumed everyone felt the same - like the session was okay, but not really performing yet.<br/><br/>I got up and started cooking dinner. Meanwhile, I listened to the others - not their words, but their voices. People were laughing, talking in weird voices, getting into character, doing stuff that sounded fun. It sounded like a table I'd really like to sit at. And after a while I got it.<br/><br/>The game is simply much more fun if you actually have a character to play. Doh!<br/><br/>Next time I'll try that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_167644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167644/#Comment_167644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T01:51:58+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  1:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YOu aRE reaLLY a biT DENse at timEs, MaTThijS. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167677/#Comment_167677" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T06:51:29+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  6:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2008 6:52AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inspired by your reply, I will play the dense peasant boy.
