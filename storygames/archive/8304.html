I'm not a big fan of OP ownership, so take this where you like.<br/><br/>I game with a table of forty-somethings. We've been around the block a few times. Most of us have been gaming since the late 70s. When 4e came out we decided to give it a shot -- it's slick and sexy and we have fond memories of D&amp;D despite spending the last several years pretty far afield.<br/><br/>We read it. We were impressed with the quality -- even precision -- of the design. We set some stuff up. We played it. And then we dropped it, probably forever. I am interested now in why we dropped it and am trying to take apart the experience because I'm sure there's some game designery ideas in the wreckage somewhere.<br/><br/>Our experience with the game was VERY combat heavy. Long chains of fights -- hugely fun, complex, tactical fights -- with a few short colour scenes here and there. We had good motivation, good purpose, and some fun characters. But it never really flew.<br/><br/>So the past few years we've been playing games that really emphasize characterisation and story -- Dogs in the Vineyard, Spirit of the Century, Reign, Diaspora (our sf fate hack), and the like. What I think happened is that these games, by helping build a strong and even complex sense of motivation, forced us to start building opposition that had more dimensions than just Evil. We were bumping into areas where the player characters were distinctly amoral compared to their opposition, even, and players struggled with that and characters grew and developed and sometimes became unsalvagable while others saw one proverbial Light or another.<br/><br/>So when we started enjoying 4e, I actually found myself feeling a little sick. I had grown used to humanising the opposition in games, and here we were murdering them unquestioned on the basis of the labels Good and Evil. I couldn't really find a way to dehumanise some of the opponent -- I mean any otyugh, sure, no problem, but the <i>de rigeur</i> first level opposition is frankly sympathetic. I like kobolds in 4e. Murdering them for their loot just doesn't work for me at all any more.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that D&amp;D has a moral defect in it or that people that play it have one. In fact I think what our table has acquired is a defect or blind spot -- having come to love a certain kind of story with certain kinds of opposition, we just can't get our heads around the idea that a Good or Evil label is sufficient for motivation. That whole genre is (perhaps temporarily) lost to us now. It wasn't that 4e failed to engender role-playing, it's that we found ourselves uncomfortable role-playing in it. Our characters were not people we liked. They were exactly the kind of people I normally have no truck with -- people with reflexive moral assignments they are prepared to follow up with violence. But more than that, there was no hope for them to change. I could stomach a character like that who could change, I think.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure there's something about the advancement system that drives this, because I know I felt a pressure to provide combat scenes in order to keep up the advancement pace. But there was also the fact that it's just fun to kill stuff with 4e. If we weren't pretending to be the killers, I think it would have been fine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183223/#Comment_183223" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T15:21:23+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  3:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>the<i>de rigeur</i>first level opposition is frankly sympathetic.

Can you provide more details?<br/><br/>And in response to Roger: It's very easy to defend, if you want to call it that, a game system on the basis of "If you don't want to play like that, then don't." But if they're playing the game correctly and the game consistently provides a specific at-the-table experience, that to me sort of implies that you need to look long and hard at the game. If you start playing <i>against</i> the design, are you still playing the same game?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183226/#Comment_183226" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T15:31:50+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  3:31PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about this as well, since I've been putzing around with 4E in my head, but haven't played much of it, partially because of the issues that you express here.  I keep trying to find a framework that makes it make sense for me.  One early experiment was the <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/dungeon-jam-7-among-the-barrowkind/" rel="nofollow">dwarves vs. undead ancestral city</a> thing I brainstormed with Dev, which was basically "dwarves try to take back Moria" done in 4E.  Killing zombies or cthuloid entities or whatever is something I can always been convinced to roll up my sleeves and do.  Another thing I brainstormed was <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/the-ghastly-inversion-of-hellmouth-purgatorium/" rel="nofollow">trying to get out of an inverted demon prison full of the damned</a>, which works for me for similar reasons.  I also think that some kind of Exalted-meets-Hamlet inspired kungfu blood opera setting might work.  Something where the main characters are somehow operating and feeling on a level above other mortals who fall like wheat before their swords.<br/><br/>Really, I think, there just need to be ways of framing campaigns so that they work for you and don't necessarily involve slaughtering other intelligent or sympathetic creatures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183227/#Comment_183227" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T15:39:26+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  3:39PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I've got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextwave" rel="nofollow">Nextwave</a> 4E hack on the backburner, where you destroy all the really, really stupid things in the Marvel Universe.

If anything the DMG treasure parcels actually support making sure characters have a given amount of loot and magic items per level totally independent of what they do or who they kill.  At least half the XP comes from Skill Challenges and Quests.  It's up to the DM and the players to create a setting or paradigm that supports their rationale for engaging with the fun tactical combat mechanics the game offers.  Sort of like every other RPG with tactical combat rules.<br/><br/>I do hack 4E to support play that I've enjoyed from other RPGs, be it FATE or some others.  I reduced hit point totals so combats are shorter.  But I do that with almost every game I play.<br/><br/>I'm not saying there isn't something to some of your points.  I adore 4E but I'll continue to play other games that offer/emphasize other kinds of fun.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed and felt edified by some 4E with complicated moral and character issues and I've alternately experienced some queasy moments over some scenes that arose when playing Polaris, PTA, In A Wicked Age, Perfect, Panty Explosion, Grey Ranks, the Shab-al-Hiri Roach or Dust Devils, never mind games like DitV, My Life With Master, Sorcerer or Poison'd (haven't played Poison'd).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183237/#Comment_183237" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T16:40:48+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  4:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some follow up thoughts.<br/><br/>I can easily see a bunch of guys in their 40s getting together to "kick it old skool" like they did in the 70s &amp; 80s having (falling into?) this experience, especially if they were using a module to run the game.  Once you've decided to play a module, WotC offered or otherwise, you're probably pretty set in the paradigm that  module offers.<br/><br/>There is some schizophrenia between the DMG and the other D&amp;D materials (also, I'll allow, some within the DMG itself).  The modules I've seen do have a fair amount of kick in the door, kill the "monsters," and take their stuff with not much rationale outside you are a PC and they are "Eeeevil."<br/><br/>The DMG offers a lot of great advice towards providing engaging scenarios based on player preferences.  The PHB gives some service to talking about character motivations, etc.  But there aren't a lot of supporting mechanics and what there are are overwhelmed by an avalanche of combat mechanics.  That's fine.  The combat is really fun.  But you have to find your own reasons for why you fight.  There's no +2 bonus for having reasons and there's no penalty for having none.<br/><br/>This isn't necessarily addressed to the OP, but I wonder whether those of us who consider ourselves "System Matters" warriors or who approach a game design wanting to follow carefully the designer's intents, not going beyond what's discretely offered by the text sometimes fail to bring and apply what we've learned from other games or from our years of role-playing experience.<br/><br/>I bring Sorcerer's kickers and bangs, PTA's scene-framing, and FATE's Aspects to every table I sit down at.  To my benefit and hopefully others'.<br/><br/>I know I've seen some discussion on this board about incomplete rules texts that assume a kind of knowledge that's been gleaned from seminal indie texts, neglecting to put those play protocols into their own game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183243/#Comment_183243" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T17:19:00+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  5:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>Brad, do you feel there was something specific about 4E -- mechanics, or something in the text that set an expectation of play -- that led you to create unlikeable characters?

So you want to fight because it's what your character does by definition and it's rewarded heavily (gold and xp) and it's enormous fun.

And that's certainly from recent and varied experiences with systems clearly designed to "craft" certain kinds of play. I think that might be the nub of it -- if we had approached old school gaming with an old school approach to rules out of the gate, we might have had better results. Ultimately, though, we already had games that delivered certain aspects of play that we had come to enjoy, so the defining features of D&amp;D were not paying off enough to stick with it and recraft it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183251/#Comment_183251" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T18:18:23+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  6:18PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, it's a critical DM job to make the opposition something that <b>needs</b> heroes to stop it. So, you don't just wander into a tribe of kobolds who are minding their own business and then murder them all. <i>Of course</i> that's distressing.<br/><br/>Instead, it's a gang of vicious kobold slavers who have been preying on another group (maybe some other kobolds, even). The slavers are nasty, unrepentant, evil-doers and they're only going to get stronger and commit more atrocities unless some heroes step up and put them down.<br/><br/>I think 4E does a really good job of expressing this core concept in the books. It sounds like the DM in your game went out of his or her way to put the PCs in situations where they were "supposed" to murder creatures simply because of their species. That's a pretty disturbing thing, no doubt. When you play Spirit of the Century, there are dastardly villains plotting bad stuff, and the heroes show up and punch them, right? The GM doesn't just send you into a Japanese village and then suggest you murder everyone because of "the yellow peril." 4E is no different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183256/#Comment_183256" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T18:47:16+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  6:47PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>You're aware, right, that the alignment rules in 4e are basically optional?

The rules do very much support an attitude wherein the GM has a determined adventure, which has unthinking combat included, which can't be worked around and shouldn't be worked around. It also actively dehumanizes the opposition and certainly does not encourage John's otherwise solid advice of laying background motivation for the murderizing. The fact that the game is completely stuck in a normative D&amp;D paradigm that always chooses D&amp;D convention over reasonable realism doesn't exactly help as the fiction is used as the bitch of the combat railroad in every way imaginable. The end-result is that you get a lot of situations where questioning the moral basis of the tactical situations is actively disruptive of play. I'm reminded of the Keep on the Shadowfell, which exemplifies this thing: it starts by having apparently fanatic murderous kobolds throw themselves upon the PCs in waves to be killed with no maneuver, negotiation or quarter given on either side, then continues with the PCs going and murdering humans who are obviously mind-controlled or at least working for motives the PCs know nothing about. After that it's off to the dungeon to "defeat the evil cult", which in practice seems to consist of slaying every single goblin that's making their home there, preferably by ambush. Of course, the only way I could deal with this as a player when it was dropped on me without preparation, context or justification was to first go all pacifistic (which ruined the game as it ground to halt and off the rails with my character doing stuff like withdrawing from unjust combat encounters) and then stop caring about the game as anything but a tactical experience, distancing myself from the horrible, horrible roleplaying aspect.<br/><br/>Answering that challenge to D&amp;D with "you don't have to play it that way" is just another way of telling people that they shouldn't do things they don't want and that they can house-rule whatever they want to play the way they want. Sure, but that's trivially true of any game.<br/><br/>The practical solutions like fielding human or demi-human opposition only rarely and with appropriate heroic context, on the other hand, are pretty fine, although I'm not myself that enthusiastic about the extremes of turning the game into some sort of angsty story game. Give me either inhuman opponents or a real war situation generated via real strategic-level interactions at the table, and I'll be happy with the combat focus. (The first part, "real strategic-level interactions" is the reason 4th edition fails by my lights, by the by - it's also a direct inspiration for my actual play this fall, as I played a very interesting campaign of primitive D&amp;D which was everything this new edition is not.) Pure murder, which is what the D&amp;D rules and GMing instructions simulate and advocate with level-balanced encounters, lack of morale and retreat rules and flimsy pretexts for aggression, turns my stomach. Just be honest enough to confess that that's what the game does and label your fixes as what they are, house-rules - blaming Brad about somehow misreading the game text in relation to how it supposes you should deal with the fiction is dishonest. Insofar as I see it, Brad was playing exactly the sort of fiction that the game advocates; moving from that to deep characterizations, complex motivations, player-negotiated combats, avoiding murder and other stuff like that is clearly drifting the game.<br/><br/>It should be obvious to anybody reading the rules of the game that the way the designers make this palatable to themselves is mostly by tuning out the fiction and focusing on the skirmish battle game with traditional D&amp;D conventions. So it's sort of never delved on how and what and why the player characters are doing; the name of the game is to win the GM-created encounters, and that's all there is to it. At least that's what I get from the rules and the official adventures, which are very clear in dealing with the fiction only as a necessary story context for the string of combat encounters. It's like a Warhammer miniatures campaign which only turns to roleplaying in the sense of having fictional choices and player improvisation matter when you bring a drastically different motivation into the rules. A perfect example of how a game can be played very differently from how it's written simply because of expectations - people expect a roleplaying game with D&amp;D 4th edition, and so they play it like one. (Which I don't want to refute or reproach - obviously the new D&amp;D makes for a bitching combat engine for a heavily house-ruled fantasy adventure game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183263/#Comment_183263" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T20:35:16+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  8:35PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Wow -- I've got a lot of things to say in response to this, but I don't really want to clutter up poor Halfjack's thread more than I probably already have.

Setting is not rules.  KotS is a D&amp;D setting.  None of my house rules for 4E have anything to do with changing mechanics associated with moral choices.<br/><br/>I really think people's past experience with D&amp;D strongly shapes their view of it and they make sometimes make statements about the rules system that are not well supported.  Notice I do not say unsupportable, but they're more often commenting on a DM's mode of running.<br/><br/>Dictionary of Mu is a brilliant, bloody setting for a rules system called Sorcerer.  It has positively amoral monsters as pre-gens that get you right into the action.  The setting might make some feel that Sorcerer is only a game about big murderous amoral acts.  It is not.  There is fertile space in Mu for all kinds of protagonist motivation.  That space is there also in games like 4E.  Even in a module like KotS.  That's not house-ruling or tacking on.  It's creating situation as you do for any rpg.<br/><br/>I think the argument is stronger for games like Hero, GURPS, and 2nd and 3rd edition D&amp;D.  The amount of time it takes to create a combat encounter in those systems means there is almost a social  imperative to combat the "things" that the DM has carefully stat'd up.  To NOT fight the things fails to honor the immense effort the DM has taken in crafting the situation where those games allow the players to engage with the beefiest part of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>With 4E you can run a game where characters meet all kinds of people with all kinds of motivations and they can decide how, when, why and indeed whether to oppose them.  If they want to move to the fighty mechanics, you can say, "five minutes smoke break," create the encounter and fight it out.<br/><br/>I wasn't blaming Brad for anything and I sure hope I wasn't being dishonest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183269/#Comment_183269" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T22:02:25+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 10:02PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2008 10:14PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobody's being dishonest on purpose, I think, but I do also think that many read the rules of 4th edition in an unnecessarily positive light (positive for their own play preferences, that is). There is nothing wrong with this, as a game like D&amp;D 4th certainly <i>has</i> to be drifted this way and that to make it comfortable for what a group is trying to achieve. But for common discourse it's better to recognize when such drift is going on.<br/><br/>For instance, I don't get it where people are finding this GMing advice about allowing players to negotiate the combat encounters. Everything I've read about this, and I've read a couple of adventures from WotC as well as the GM's guide, indicates that the GM prepares these set-piece battles where both location and opposition is fixed and elaborately planned to provide the most fantastical, action-filled experience possible. It's dancing bear game design where the GM is supposed to entertain the group. I do incidentally agree with everybody about 4th edition being easier to wing (my brother Markku plays something like three sessions a week, and he tells me that this is the absolutely best part of 4th edition), but that's not what the GMing guide tells you to do. It also lacks all tools for dynamic adaptation of situations, which basically means that any strategic-level choices you give your players are essentially freeform; as the game is written, there is no support at all for choosing your own battles, preparing conditions to your advantage or going for any tactical goals except total annihilation. (I harp about this strategy stuff because in my analysis that's the thing that prevents 4th from being a good gamist rpg in the vein of old D&amp;D; I'm convinced that allowing players strategic freedom would fix these problems with unbelievable, vicious and superficial fiction as well.)<br/><br/>But this is really sounding like bitching about D&amp;D more than constructive dialogue about Brad's experiences. I'm not even properly prepared to defend my reading of the book right now; perhaps I'll write a blog post or something about this at some point if I start feeling strongly enough that I need to sermonize the world about how they're playing D&amp;D wrong (and, heaven forbid, enjoying themselves).  I just wanted to say that I sympathize with Brad and think that he's not imagining anything, what he experienced is exactly what you get if you play modern D&amp;D (and old D&amp;D possibly as well) at face value. Or alternatively, it's what you get when you play with me trying to take the game at face value. Apparently others are taking different lessons away from that GMing guide.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183279/#Comment_183279" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T23:31:42+00:00" title="December 13, 2008 11:31PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2008 11:42PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(Not to derail, but Rocket Raccoon fucking rocks--at least in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Starlord</span> limited series.)</i><br/><br/>Brad, the notion raised in this thread of campaign framing really resonates with me.  I'm not sure I'm going to dip a toe into 4E because the thrust of the gameplay isn't my cup of tea--I don't tend to care for wargame-like tactical gaming.  That said, I'm pretty sure a number of narrative frames would contextualize a 4E game in a way that doesn't drop it into a binary judgment style of cosmology.<br/><br/>Here are some ideas--not saying they're <i>good</i> ones, but maybe they'll offer food for thought.<br/><br/>- Rearchitect alignment itself.  To some extent, the Moorcock Law-Chaos axis (dropped out of 4E) fudges the morality into something more relativistic.  A Nobilis-style breakdown could work too, albeit with tinkering to fit (Light, Dark, Heaven, Hell, Wild).<br/><br/>- Put together a more gray-area frame that keeps the DnD alignment but decouples it from actual player behavior.  Make alignment a player choice but in the shared fiction, characters are just "born" that way and don't necessarily have to follow their natures.  In this case, acting within alignment might grant a bonus, or acting against it might incur a small penalty or hesitation.  Only keep the really extreme shit tied to absolutes.  This might be the Perdido Street Station flavor, lets you have a very mixed set of alignments in a party.<br/><br/>- If you don't want to hack the system (or the alignment bit, at any rate), find a tight campaign frame that puts characters into a meat grinder that justifies gratuitous violence.  <i>Midnight</i> might offer a good example here.  Another might be to play a DnD Reservoir Dogs game.  Go all Tarantino with it.  Defend the shit out of a village or something.  I dunno.  Might be too far from the default assumption of dungeon-delving independent adventurers.<br/><i><br/>Edited to add my reading of the rules jives with what Eero has said--4E is essentially geared to provide a series of high-octane tactical combat set-pieces, which it apparently does very well.  Options for resolving a combat-prepped scenario via non-combat means seem fairly limited to nil within the rules, though I supppose you could double down an encounter as a non-combat challenge alongside the combat stats.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183307/#Comment_183307" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T11:51:51+00:00" title="December 14, 2008 11:51AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I like kobolds in 4e.

I'm interested in why it broke. Most of the solutions dance around the real issue, especially Logos7 above: to wit, I did in fact find murdering for loot a great deal of fun. And that's what turned out to be disturbing enough that we stopped. In our 4e experiment, killing opponents felt a lot more like murdering than exterminating vermin. I think some of that is 4e -- the fun part, mostly, but also all the likable humanoids -- and some of that is us, who have grown used to humanising opponents. The combination went astray I think. The most fun way to play was the most distressing. Of course one can tweak and tune and change the premise or the game, but there are lots of other games that already do what it would wind up doing. And I think you'd have to necessarily cut out or reduce some of what makes 4e huge fun: that roller coaster combat slide down the dungeon.<br/><br/>I'm not saying 4e is bad, evil, or broken. Nor its players. I don't want to fix it.

I was talking about swapping out Good-Evil and replacing it with Law-Chaos / Chaos-Law to produce a dichotomy that isn't necessarily black and white.  In Moorcock's works, Chaos isn't necessarily evil and Law isn't necessarily good.  When they're out of balance, the stronger force is portrayed as detrimental to that particular cosmos.  Thus the Eternal Champion becomes an agent of balance.  In other words, Law-Chaos isn't really congruent to morality, but could be considered a philosophically-based axis instead of a morality-based one.<br/><br/>Without knowing more about your take, I'd guess our views are pretty close.<br/><br/>Also (parenthetically), Brad's comment subsequent to mine made it clear I misread what kind of feedback he was looking for.

I don't think so. I think we could easily create sympathetic characters on any side in any war, because humans generally (though the specific failures are dramatic) are likable. But if the system paid us off for looting and raping, things would get problematic. So I don't think this is about setting.

(Warning:  spoilers ahead.)  The kobolds attack first and are fanatics that fight to the last man.  We don't get a clear idea of <i>why</i> they're fanatics, but I get a feeling that that's supposed to just be built into them in 4e -- by default, they're fanatical dragon-worshippers.

Since they're fanatics, they won't listen to reason, so that narrows the options considerably.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing from there, the players find that the kobolds have been answering to a goblin, who also seems to fight fanatically -- and they find that the goblin has a symbol of the cult of Orcus on him, and a letter linking him to someone who seems to be a priest in the cult of Orcus.  That leads them to discover the secret of the keep, and keeping the cult from creating an opening into the Shadowfell is definitely a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the killing in the adventure comes from first self-defense, then defense of the town, then defense of the region.  Taking the stuff of the monsters is incidental.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe battle locations and opposition are set -- it's hard to do otherwise in an adventure module -- but the ways that the PCs deal with them are not.  The ambushes force things, but both the kobold lair and the dig site are set up with GM advice about how PCs might sneak around and scout, then position themselves.  The advice there is still combat-oriented, but a smart party may well come up with other ways to deal with things -- e.g., having a rogue sneak in and try to get things, trying to disguise one or more party members, etc.  Like 3rd edition, 4th actually has rules that can be used to adjudicate that sort of thing... but people still tried them back in 1st and 2nd, when it was up to GM fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe free RPG day module -- the only other 4th edition module I've seen so far -- does a much poorer job of setting things up, but I think that's because it was designed to be very short, and to "drop in" to any campaign easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I like subverting things to make players question what's going on.  Some of my favorite past bits I've done were:<br/>\n<br/>\n* An orc tribe that was suspected of ambushing and killing travelers -- but were actually innocent, and were being framed by a group of bandits who had an illusionist leading them.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Hobgoblins who were moving westward, and attacking and stealing along their path -- but who turned out to be fleeing from a group of gnolls who were trying to kill them, and didn't <i>want</i> to be fighting the humans or taking their stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Finding a group of apparent cultists in black robes, gathered around an altar with a young girl lying on it, unconscious -- only to discover that the girl was already dead, and everyone was in black because it was a funeral.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Coming across an apparent fight between gnomes and goblins, and going in to try to help the gnomes -- only to discover that the gnomes and goblins were friendly, and playing a sporting match, not battling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this (and several more besides), I did in first and second edition AD&amp;D.;  My players quickly learned to look below the surface, and not jump to conclusions based on D&amp;D; stereotypes.  There's nothing in 4th edition to prevent doing this sort of thing there, if one wishes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184739/#Comment_184739" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T16:15:29+00:00" title="December 23, 2008  4:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one is claiming that 4e prevents this kind of subversion.

Of course there are other options, but it's still fairly marginal. D&amp;D has a massive and fun combat &amp; combat magic system, which they probably didn't put in there to promote storytelling and solving conflicting interests by peaceful negotiation. When you only have a hammer, every problem becomes a nail. In D&amp;D 4th you have lots and lots of different hammers, some of them with the coolest enchantments ever, so it naturally promotes a certain type of approach.<br><br>As for Halfjack's original pondering, I'd just put it bluntly and say that some things are cooler when you're a kid and don't really think about them. When I was a kid, it was solid fun laughing at disabled people, breaking stuff, throwing stones at anthills and slaughtering entire communities of innocent kobolds and goblins. I still do that stuff, of course, but the kicks I get really aren't the same anymore <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184972/#Comment_184972" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-26T18:17:51+00:00" title="December 26, 2008  6:17PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd make a distinction between toolkit game design and mechanical focus, personally.
