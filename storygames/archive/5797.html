Something that I'd look forward to playing, something that would inspire me and keep engaging me play after play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want players with power, in-game and out-of-game. I want the theme of the game, from top to bottom, to be about power. Say you've got close-to infinite power: you want to do something, no matter how outrageous, you've got at least a fighting chance to succeed. What do you do with it? Where does responsibility fit into the picture? Is power inevitably corrupting? Or is it, ultimately, a matter of choice?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in Sorcerer mechanics; it's my default in-my-head system. I don't do dice curves, or cards, and for this game, using a point system doesn't feel right. Just because you can push around the universe, doesn't mean it can't push back. I like the idea of variable error; it adds tension. I love the Currency system. But still, out-of-the-box, Sorcerer won't do it for this game. The idea of demons who have the actual power, and the bargaining for it, and Humanity as it works in Sorcerer won't do what I want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let's talk about my idea for a game: EGO. You have the power to warp reality if you really want it bad enough. Tired of that guy who cut you off while he was yakking on his cellphone? Use your power to hurl him off the road. Fuck collateral damage! If he's still alive, let him handle the expenses; it'll be a learning experience about paying attention when you drive!<br/>\nOr better yet, wait until you're both stopped at a red light. You get out, walk to his driver-side door. You smash open his window, grab the cellphone, crush it in one hand, and then you pick up his car and heave it off to the side of the road. And if you're a little leisurely getting back to your car, and the light turns green, who's going to give you any static about it? If they're dumb enough to honk their horn at you, or give you the one-finger salute, they deserve to end up right next to Chattering Asshole Cellphone Driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr say your tastes run into Biblical-style vengeance. Tired of that snotty little fucker on the other end of the Internet, the one who keeps on making those ass-chafing comments about Your Favorite Game/Movie/TV Show/etc.? Well, one day when he goes too far, you make your face appear on the screen, call him a waste of fucking skin, and you make his computer attack him, fusing itself into him like in that movie Tetsuo: the Iron Man. Yeah, it kills him, but so what? He looked young enough, and his parents are probably young enough to squeeze out a better model in no time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking of going minimal on the Attributes. To be honest, I'm thinking one: Ego. If you want it bad enough, it will be done. But I'm also thinking of something like Spiritual Attributes from TROS. If you really have an interest in something, you can add your Passion score to the Ego score and roll to make it happen. More than one, if they apply. because let's face it: you only get real results if you're committed to getting results.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm thinking of having two ways to go about something: Regular and EXTREME. Regular is just when you want to open a really stubborn door, drive a car in treacherous conditions, talk out your frustrations with your boss and get positive results, or just pound some asshole who won't stay out of your face. It's ordinary, everyday stuff. You can whiff it, or you can succeed but end up doing yourself more harm than good. EXTREME is when you blatantly throw the laws of physics face-first into the mattress and go to town. Want to punch someone so hard you pop them like a zit? Want to do that to a building? Want lightning to smite your enemies? How about a plague of locusts, or rabid rats? Want to turn water into kickass bourbon? Want to turn that annoying skinhead prick into a black woman? Want to make someone your devoted slave? Well, you roll against a difficulty chart that I haven't yet gotten around to making up, and you roll against it, dice against dice, just like in Sorcerer. No matter how the roll turns out, you succeed in doing what you want to do, but if your roll sucked, you'll take fallout for it (negative Currency). Also, if you roll EXTREME, you have to roll your character's Ego vs. his/her Ego (+Fallout, if any); if you fail, you lose a point of Ego.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can regain it back. At the end of a conflict, if you succeed in your goal, you can roll Ego + [Spiritual Attribute] against your current Ego to boost yourself one point. Or you can use that point to boost any [SA], or buy a new one. Keep in mind: if you run out of Ego, you're in NPC or dead territory.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can die in this game, multiple times in fact, but until you are defeated (your Ego is reduced to zero) you can't die permanently. You can reform yourself, but you have to go EXTREME to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also regain Ego by canceling an EXTREME effect by another Egoist (PC). That takes effect immediately in-game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, I have specific questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Sorcerer a good mechanical basis for this game? Are there any better ones you out there can suggest?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I encourage characters to fail in this game, without minimizing the danger of the character's Ego bottoming out?<br/>\nI'd like to tie it into the improvement mechanics, if I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I set difficulty levels for standard conflicts against a person, an angry mob, riot police, an army division, a solid door, a prison cell, a prison, etc?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want rotating GMs for this game. There is nothing that frustrates me more than one guy getting stuck with running the game, and the other players kicking back and waiting on that one person. I want the GM to have fun, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I keep the other players interested when their character isn't in the spotlight? Fan-mail mechanic, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I set this in the "real world" or in a fantasy setting? Should I have the option for both?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129788/#Comment_129788" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T14:02:28+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  2:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2008 2:34PM by spookyfanboy.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129794/#Comment_129794" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T14:26:09+00:00" title="February 23, 2008  2:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Four whole hours.<br><br>This is not the right time, place, or environment.

How strongly does the character really want to get that particular thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this could be balanced by making it possible to use the character's [SA] against him or her in some way.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSee, I had an idea about giving the other players chips, or something. If they thought that something in the character's background, or one of his Passions, would actually hinder him, they would pay out X amount of chips (like 1 or 2, or equal to the level of the Passion, or whatever), and the player of that character could either:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Accept the chips, and concede defeat for that particular conflict,<br/>\n2) Gamble, and roll the dice anyway. If he won, he wouldn't keep the chips, but if he lost, he would. Accepting the chips puts the equivalent amount of dice on the opponent's side, as far as the roll goes.<br/>\n3) Refuse the chips, and roll as normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chips could either be spent during game to activate what the character thinks are good traits in his background for extra dice (Passions are always available for the player) during rolls, or he could wait until the end of the story, and use those bonus chips to see if he upgraded either his Ego, one of his Passions, or add a new Passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, keep in mind, throughout all of this, I'm talking about the mechanics as if I'm using the currency system found in Ron Edward's Sorcerer. I'm not completely wedded to that idea, yet, and if anyone can show me some mechanics which will do the same thing only even more closely to what I want to do for this game, I'll be happy to convert.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">How do I set difficulty levels for standard conflicts against a person, an angry mob, riot police, an army division, a solid door, a prison cell, a prison, etc?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe difficulty is actually "risk level" rather than actual difficulty, since the character will succeed either way. Consider, what exactly makes using the power risky, fiction-wise? The actual risk of going solo against a squad of riot police? The character's perception of the risk? Something else? What's the reason you need the difference in risk level between going against an army division and solid door in the first place?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSee, I was sure I wasn't being clear in that first post, and this proves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want there to be a separation between when the player is doing stuff normally, and when the player is bending reality around his little finger. I don't really want the headache of coming up with entirely unified mechanics for when they try to fix a car, versus when they just make the problem go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the character does things normally, they run the risk of whiffing it. It just doesn't succeed. With Sorcerer's currency option, maybe they make it worse if they keep trying to work on it. That's why I want benchmarks for their risk level. When they go EXTREME and try to get their way through sheer force of will, that's when they succeed in getting the job done, but depending on how well they roll, there may be some fallout from it either right away, or down the road, depending on the context of what happened.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">How do I keep the other players interested when their character isn't in the spotlight? Fan-mail mechanic, maybe?</div>\n</blockquote>\nOuch, this is the problem I face in Illumination as well since I ditched the GM guy. Fan-mail as a general reward mechanic will probably work the way you're used to seeing it work. However, I think you might possibly get a better mileage if you find a way to occupy the non-spotlight players by engaging them in some activity that would drive the game towards addressing those core questions you posed, for everyone. I'm really not sure what could that be, though.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nOkay, I'm curious: What do you think of my idea I presented above, the one where other players can buy in to highlight the difficulties, internal or (maybe even) external arrayed against the PC? Does that help alleviate the problem, you think, by involving them in the game when their character isn't involved? I guess you could say I'm looking for a way to throw Spirit of the Century into this mix as well, particularly the Aspects part of it. But I think it might be a good way to keep the other player's focused on the game, and perhaps also a good gauge to see if the other player's are interested in the PC's drama.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I think the game has a good chance to be pretty hackable. So, you could have no default setting at all, or have one - the latter option gives the group a good starting point, obviously. The question is, what kind of default feel you want the game to have?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI'd like it to be modern, but maybe I should have pointers on how to make a fantasy game out of it. Like I said above, there may be some groups that might get uncomfortable with this game without the fantasy setting there to take the edge off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129896/#Comment_129896" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T22:56:29+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 10:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite>MKAdams: That was my first thought, too.

Does that help alleviate the problem, you think, by involving them in the game when their character isn't involved?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure. It might. Basically, if I understand it right, you invite other players to create adversity for the spotlight player (and mechanically reward the player at the same time). However, what are the reason why I'd want to do it, in the context of this game? I have an option - now, why I want to use it?<br><br>The way it currently works in Illumination is that to change the reality, you need to spend dice from your personal pool. Afterwards, they go into a communal pool. To get them back, you need to either:<br>a). Create adversity for other players. When you do, you roll dice from the communal pool and take them to your personal pool afterwards.<br>b). Bribe another player into accepting some fact about his or her character. This gives both of you a die (though the other player will most probably get a better die than you).<br>This still wasn't playtested enough, but the new economy moves the game in a PvP direction quite a bit. Since it's all war of paradigms at this point, it fits well. However, the point is, even as a non-spotlight player you always have a good mechanical reason to be interested. Everybody at the table has means to interact with the game meaningfully available all the time.<br><br><b>Now, what if whenever you offer the chips to another player an acceptance of your offer also gives you something? Or maybe the other player, accepting your offer, apart from "good chips" gains an equal amount of "bad chips" that he or she can later offer to you? That way, you'd want to create difficulty for the others because it would give them the currency needed to later create difficulty for you, which rewards you at the same time.</b><br><br>That last bit there, I like. It will need work, but it enforces a little bit the theme of self-interest harnessed toward making a change in the world. Let me ponder that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130490/#Comment_130490" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T08:10:28+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  8:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2008 8:47AM by Hituro.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Carl, you gave me valuable help on Solipsist, so I am happy to return the favor, but I feel I am not grasping something.<br><br>Is the essential difference from Solipsist the motivation for the changes in reality from desire to revenge?

After all a Solipsist (in the game terms) is just someone who desires things enough that they happen, because they want them too. And indeed, if it doesn't happen when you want it's because you didn't want it enough (i.e. your own limitations were too much for you, they undermined your will).<br><br>Passions therefore equal obsessions (the Solipsist term).<br><br>If Solipsist doesn't answer your need then that's fine of course but I think there is less difference than you make it sound. I could totally imagine  playing the game you are describing with the Solipsist rules. In fact I would argue that it is exactly what they were designed for.

I'm looking to create a game about power, near-unlimited power, and what you do with it once you have it. To make it interesting, there has to be some resistance, but where should it come from? For what I want to do, I'd prefer it come from the character's Passions. Passions are the fuel that drive him, but how can you maintain that Passion when everything you could want gets handed to you if you push hard enough? <br><br>Also, I'm thinking about some sort of fallout when the PC pushes too hard in the wrong direction. Why? Because that could also be story fuel, as the PC tries to set right what he screwed up. But I don't want to fall into the Paradox trap of not-quite fitting the punishment to the crime that sometimes happened. Solipsist has that feedback for pushing too hard, but it's specifically tailored to the unique situation of being a Solipsist. <br><br>Is this making any sense? Essentially, I'm looking for the narrativist version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlx4n_ibNZE" rel="nofollow">Shoot 'Em Up</a>, or the mythical "River Tam Beats Up Everybody" movie. A lot of people who know what they want, and can and will move heaven and earth to get it, and what happens when they do. Of course, the fun part is to design it so that the action moves everyone's story along, until they burn out and finally die.

People have criticised the fact that in writing Solipsist I didn't trust the player to narrate their own failure, but I think it makes perfect sense for your game to not let them. You are talking (as I read it) about parallel consequences, you both succeed at what you want and a terrible consequence happens at the same time (with a variable degree of both), rather like the parallel intents from Shock's conflicts.<br><br>Say you had a dice pool mechanic where you rolled D6s and looked for successes. Instead of making it 5+ you could say 1s and 6s were successes. The total number of successes determined if the power worked, and then the 6s go to the player to narrate the degree of effect, but the 1s go to the player to the right to narrate the degree of backlash.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131465/#Comment_131465" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T18:49:08+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  6:49PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.
