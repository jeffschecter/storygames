Last time we played, all my character's goals (and therefore mine in this case) were killed off one by one, which made me loose all my investments with my character in the game. Is this the same thing as having your character killed? In both cases, the player is loosing the main investment in the game but I'm not talking about the character itself but about what it strives for.<br/><br/>Could one simple solution to this be to separate the character's goal and the player's goal? As an example, a player could strive to show the ripple effect of the death of it's character. Another example could be to overthrow the king. The character's goal could be something different, but it's something the player strives for while playing. I would appreciate a game where the goals between the characters and the players were more (not implicit) separated. Where the game itself actually talked more about this to make the participants aware of it.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where I'm going with this, so I'm mostly throwing out a thought.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413985/#Comment_413985" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T06:15:03+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  6:15AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a player separated themselves from their character then the goals can't be killed. Of course this means crucifying immersion. Maybe not the best solution.<br/><br/>Of course in the D+D games I played in high school one character died and another magically just showed up (no matter how deep we were in the dungeon) so the goal also didn't die - it just regenerated. <br/><br/>What may really be happening though is the killing of player's energy and creativity. That is a real loss - more so than any imaginary character. I've been using a rule where you can't kill other player's characters until the last scene of the game. This works because my games are one shots, use preset scene cards to guide the story, and play in an hour so people don't lose interest before the hammer falls. Not a solution for on going campaign games. <br/><br/>This is an interesting philosophical point. I'm interested to see where people take it. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413991/#Comment_413991" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T07:20:13+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  7:20AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this will help Rickard, but the fun I like in RPGs is Game Master fun.<br/><br/>Part of the character related GM fun is that I get to play multiple characters. Some may be well fleshed out, some may have a line or two of description, and some may be made up on the fly.<br/><br/>No matter what happens, I almost always get to play a character in every scene, and if they die or are effectively removed from the story, I have another ready to go instantly, that fits somewhere in events in the story.<br/><br/>Just as importantly, I get to play through the whole game. Even if the scene has nothing to do with any of my characters, I still have other stuff I can do, and I always have a reason to pay attention to what the other participants are doing the entire time the session is going on.<br/><br/>So here's the thing: When I'm puttering with projects, I try to concentrate on GM type fun, and spreading that around to everybody. Other people far smarter than me can spend their time making games about One player-One character fun, and I'll just buy or download those.<br/><br/>So, that's where my thinking would start.<br/><br/>As a player, a GM has different goals in a traditional style RPG, so for me, the player goal and the character in-fiction goals of the characters I play as a GM are always already seperated.<br/><br/>I f you can identify what the goals of the GM are in relation to that character play, then you can write them down and spread them around.<br/><br/>yeah, i know that's weirdly philosophical.

A character just gets new priorities. (It's the same question as "what happens when you accomplish your goal?") I think that can be a very interesting question: what do you do when something you've been aiming for is no longer an option?<br/><br/>A character, at that point, can either despair of new goals, or find something else to pursue. While I can understand that it's really hard, it can also be for the better to think up new goals.

But it's a good point.\n<blockquote>What may really be happening though is the killing of player's energy and creativity.

I never thought if it in that way, but it seems logical now when you mentioned it. Now I can take experiences from blocking into account when I'm thinking about this. Thanks!<br/><br/>On a related note. I've been in games where the goal has been killed without anyone else but the player itself knows about it. That's nothing more than the player own fault, because goals should be known by everyone so anyone can play against them. It's the classic example with the secret assassin. If no one knows about the assassin, the secret will probably never come into play. If the secret is instead known by everyone, anyone can frame scenes to put the assassin player into trouble. Much more giving, much more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413999/#Comment_413999" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T08:47:59+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  8:47AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a player, a GM has different goals in a traditional style RPG, so for me, the player goal and the character in-fiction goals of the characters I play as a GM are always already seperated.<br/><br/>I f you can identify what the goals of the GM are in relation to that character play, then you can write them down and spread them around.</blockquote>\nDo you know any games that does this explicitly?

I wanted character goals to be a collaboration. In my game there is a Goal tracker and certain action types advance that goal. The Players determine the Action Type, so they have a lot of control over that progress (they do have to sacrifice using the other Action Types, but if your Goal is important to you, i should be worth it).<br/>  Exalted 2e had a decent Goal mechanic, but there was s till a lot of GM Fiat in there. Solar System/Shadow of Yesterday is another game where achieving Goals becomes more collaborative.<br/>  But, more to your point, yes, killing a character's goals is a lot like killing the character. In small doses, it works because it could represent that little setback a character gets before they triumph. But if it happens consistently, it creates a strong disincentive to engage inn the game at all.<br/>  I hope your game turns around soon!<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414003/#Comment_414003" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T10:40:35+00:00" title="May 13, 2013 10:40AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2013 10:41AM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh, I'd say that having your character's goals killed may certainly be worse than having your character killed. It's like watching a series for a character's story to suddenly find that character removed from the plot withouth having any impact on it. Of course there are ways this can be turned in-character. It's a loss, it can be roleplayed as such. Your character may find that now that his nemesis is dead, he misses him and has to find another goal in life. The gm might also make it so now the PC has to face the heritage/followers of his nemesis. In the worst case it may mean your character no longer has a tie with the story so you'd probably be better making a new one with different ties with the plot.<br/><br/>As a GM I'd also prefer to give the players the option of passing each other their goal with their dying breathe (as in "Avenge my death!" or "please promise me you'll help this people kill X!") or to their new npcs. I once had a PC dying in a glorious blaze of destruction, to have his father come later to find the tomb of his son and swear death to his murder. It isn't nothing new but certainly worked for a good introduction to the new character, thus keeping the goals alive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414006/#Comment_414006" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T11:16:19+00:00" title="May 13, 2013 11:16AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2013 11:17AM by Paul_T.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that an important feature of game design is how player and character goals resolve. In a good game, the resolution itself leads to a new situation. As a simple example, designs which a zero-sum tend to do this really well: if you achieve something, it's always someone else's loss. So, quite naturally, other people will now have new goals related to the fallout of your success.<br/><br/>I'm playing in a Diplomacy game right now, and it does this very well: it's set up so that you never have enough resources to effectively hold on to what you have, and never enough to achieve your next goal. So you must lean on other players for help, even while your successes are creating problems for other players. This sort of thing can work well in more story-oriented games.<br/><br/>Another good example is Otherkind Dice, or any game based on the idea that success usually comes at a price: "Ok, you've captured the princess's heart, but... she's being shipped off to America! ...her family is facing an uprising and about to lose their grasp on the throne! ...she's just been engaged to someone else!<br/><br/>No matter what you've achieved, there are important repercussions which create new situations for you or others to deal with.<br/><br/>And the same should go for when you fail or your goals slip out of your grasp. (This works quite easily if that happens because someone else achieves their aims, as opposed to one actor simply failing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414007/#Comment_414007" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T12:14:15+00:00" title="May 13, 2013 12:14PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm confused by what you mean by goals being "killed off".

I kinda picked it up generally from lots of games where there was more GM style fun and mechanical support for all players.<br/><br/>For me, it was partly  a process of unlearning some behaviors gained from playing a classic style RPG set up and relearning stuff I did as a kid just playing pretend ( but keeping some stuff I'd learned as a GM).<br/><br/>It is a mindset jump though. Unless you can figure out some way for a player to unlock the general vibe of how they played successfully as kids with other kids, playing pretend as characters, and playing side supporting characters, and making up stories/events/settings, and making trouble for those beloved characters all at the same time (or in quick sequence), people are never going to get it.<br/><br/>Frankly, the way RPG classic style design has evolved over time directly puts obstacles up to that kind of mindset jump.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414010/#Comment_414010" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T13:13:47+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  1:13PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An example of killing a goal:<br/><br/>So, I was in a game with a gm and one other player. The other player's character decided to do a very complicated ritual that would alter the magical flow in his home town. I asked the gm, "So, is this a plot specifically for his character? Because I'd like to get involved, but I don't want to get invested in this plotline if it's just a plot for him."<br/><br/>The gm assured me it was fine for both of us to be involved. And there was a cool adventure about gathering information that involved time travel, New Orleans, and Marie Laveau. It really rocked.<br/><br/>And then, the gm ran a solo adventure for the other player (which was not out of line, as this was deliberately created to be a game any combination of us could pick up) during which the whole magic flow alteration was done by gm fiat because the PC happened to mention he wanted this in front of an NPC whom the gm decided had the power to make it so and would logically do it just for the asking, with strings attached.<br/><br/>This was years ago, and I didn't believe even at the time that the gm deliberately tried to shaft me. The gm tended to forget things and gm on the fly. It happens. It was a mistake, it happened, we moved on.<br/><br/>But, my character's goal of helping out with this ritual and making sure everything went right was completely killed, dead as a door nail. It's possible that the other PC's goal was killed by this as well, as the PC was no longer doing a ritual and keeping control of events, but this PC had been handed a juicy situation in return: he owed a favor to the NPC who'd made things as he wished them to be. My PC had a goal made irrelevant, with nothing in return.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414015/#Comment_414015" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T16:59:19+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  4:59PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2013 7:35PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's say in this system you roll to try to do ritual stuff, you rolled and ended up unable to contribute, would you consider that the same outcome?<br/><br/>Edit: I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is this different from just losing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414018/#Comment_414018" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-13T19:14:17+00:00" title="May 13, 2013  7:14PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what about a system where you, as a player, decide on maybe three ways you want to affect the fictional world.  <br/><br/>Then, and it's important that this is a secondary step, you create a character (or more?) designed to enact those goals.

A character just gets new priorities. (It's the same question as "what happens when you accomplish your goal?") I think that can be a very interesting question: what do you do when something you've been aiming for is no longer an option?<br/><br/>A character, at that point, can either despair of new goals, or find something else to pursue. While I can understand that it's really hard, it can also be for the better to think up new goals. Change of heart on the part of a character?</blockquote>\nI actually think it's the same difficulty (give or take) to create a new character as making up a new goal with an old character. See the last paragraph in this post if you want to know why. I otherwise really like what you're saying. I've been realizing these last years that roleplaying characters, my own at least, are very one-dimensional. They strive for one goal and one goal only, or they tend to follow the same personality no matter what happens. A multi-layered character changes depending on the situation. You're not always a greedy dwarf, because you can sometimes give coins to children. That's depth when it comes to personality.<br/><br/>In the movie Transporter, the hero always follows his code as a driver. Always ... up until he's going to deliver a body bag and discovers that there's a (of course) beautiful woman in the bag. He then breaks his code. A code that the audience have been force fed with is unbreakable. I think it would be better if it would be established beforehand that he would never hurt a woman and then had to choose between his two codes. That's layers. That's why a greedy dwarf can give coins to children.<br/><br/>It's the same thing with goals. You can try to reach it, but you should try to reach it in different ways, depending on the situation. You should also have other kinds of goals, and change your priorities on what's more important to achieve. I think it should also be clear what the next path will be as soon as the main goal is reachable. A dwarf could have as a goal to become rich, but as soon as the dwarf is getting close to the goal, the next goal could appear so everyone could help the character advance towards that. It's somewhat what <b>Paul_T</b> is talking about. I think it would be good to have several goals to reach, perhaps one primary and then 1-2 secondary goals. Perhaps you can suffice with being the town sheriff instead of the mayor?<br/><br/>One thing I've been thinking of lately is having end conditions. When one or two end conditions are reached, the story ends. The traditional roleplaying games both have it and don't have it. Finishing a dungeon is, as an example, an end condition but the character will advance to the next story. Goals can be typical  end conditions, and if people starts to notice that one person is close to it's goal, perhaps they will go for their secondary goals instead? Let's say it's a GM-less game about an election for the new mayor in a nameless western town. When the mayor is selected, the game ends. Other posts are sheriff, ranch owner or whatever fits the genre. All participants strives to both put their characters on the best posts but also have a better post than the player to the right. Perhaps you get 5 points for defeating your left-hand neighbor, 3 points for being a mayor, 2 points for sheriff and so on. This may sound  like a boardgame in the same genre as Diplomacy, but I think it's possible to pull this off as a roleplaying game if you got the right structures (including the rules).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>On a related note. Play Unsafe tells us to don't plan ahead. Is it possibly the same thing with goals? You can strive to fulfill a goal, but if you start to plan <i>how</i> to solve it, your mind will render a high risk of being locked if others starts to disturb your plans. When that happens, it's about the same difficulty to create a new character with a goal than creating a new one with an old character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414049/#Comment_414049" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T08:29:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  8:29AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2013 2:05PM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The logical conundrums of all these possibilities is mind blowing!

In the therapy group, you didn't have anything laid out so you could predict anything (I'm guessing). If someone established a new fact, you had to think fast on how to respond on it. I've been playing with relationship maps where there has been around ten different characters with 17 relations all in all. It's doable, but only because everybody can see the relationship map AND because you only have to look up relations related to the characters involved in the scene. When I'm playing in ordinary (GM less) games, the structure for playing out a scene goes as follows.<br/><br/>1. Pick a character.<br/>2. Look up the relations to that character on the map. (takes around 10 seconds)<br/>3. Frame a scene with the relations in mind by creating a situation and throw in some characters in it.<br/>4. Play out the scene with the characters.<br/><br/>The only way <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> in this list takes time is if the goals aren't clear. You can notice this in <b>Fiasco</b> - every time it takes time to frame a scene is because the goal of the character isn't clear. So you don't really need to know ALL the relations - just the goals. Who wants what. Play to find out how. The character's with a clear goal is also usually the ones that you remember. Those had a story to be told.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414060/#Comment_414060" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T12:41:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2013 12:41PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It becomes much more manageable when you ask yourself "What is the next thing that needs to be done?'

No player plans that much ahead, or knows that no matter what they plan, other players, the GM or the dice can thwart it. Of course on the cases of heavy illusionism the GM actually does this, and while possible, it requires such a feat of organization, memory, concentration and creativity it's no wonder illusionist GMs tend to burn out in the long term. It's a lot healthier to play it unsafe or prep random kicks ready to be used anytime.<br/><br/>Back to goals: these are designed to give players an idea for what their characters are doing when the story begins, to guide their interaction with the fiction. Of course these goals can ge changed, though usually that's under player's control. Situations created by the GM or other players however can make them non-relevant, and as in the case Lisa Padol posted above. In such cases, when the player has invested in the goal is equivalent to a character which has seen the same anount of investment from the player. Thus, the effect is the same: kill an character or it's goals, you're denying the player's <i>Investment</i>. That's the core of the issue here.<br/><br/>So I think you should probably be as careful with the character's goals as with the character itself. As a GM, both should be given the same chances of remaining and making an impact in the fiction. Yes, both can be easily replaced, but the Investment made in them won't come back that easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414072/#Comment_414072" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T16:03:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  4:03PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I roll and fail, my character has tried and failed.

If a GM takes my character's goal off the table without giving me a chance at having the player try for it, presuming there is no OOC discussion, then I am going to be less invested in any future goals. After all, the GM has just shown a total lack of concern in making the game about what I want my PC to achieve, and any future goal could get stomped at any point. So, I don't want to care about my PC's goals. That will just make me sad or angry. I'll just care less -- invest less -- overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414075/#Comment_414075" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T16:12:27+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  4:12PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To get back a bit to the original question, I could see player goals and character goals being fairly different in a comedy game.<br/><br/>The characters goals would be known and drive their action in the fiction, but it could be the player's goal to see their own character fail hilariously. Not necessarily funny to the character when it happens, but funny to the character's player and the other players at the table.<br/><br/>I suppose, in a way, this is like playing a Bad Guy character in that regard.<br/><br/>Notably, playing baddies and comic relief characters tends to fall into the purview of GMs.<br/><br/>Hmm...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414076/#Comment_414076" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T16:23:09+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  4:23PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, I've been thinking about this a bit more, trying to think of an example of separate player goals vs. character goals.<br/><br/>A little off the beaten path, but consider a game where some of the players are Good Guys and some are Bad Guys.<br/><br/>Very simplistic stuff right?<br/><br/>Okay, the baddies have actual character goals they're going to strive for by way of fictional events.<br/><br/>There's also a rule however that says that Baddies <b>cannot</b> ultimately win the scenario.<br/><br/>As a player, you know these things.

The game should state the goals that the players will embrace (just like any other game). If the game example above is about the players playing Nazi soldiers when Indiana Jones enters the base, the characters should loose <i>with style</i> (I'm taking the example from a adventure at a convention <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ).

In such cases, when the player has invested in the goal is equivalent to a character which has seen the same anount of investment from the player.

I really liked <b>Lisa</b>'s example and clarification. It's not about failing to reach your goal, but others shooting it down without you having a say about it.<br/><br/>I think it's important what you wrote in your first sentence, that the goals makes the characters do stuff. A player can't do anything without either a character or it's goal. But if I go back to the philosophical take, can you play a game where your character doesn't have a goal but you do, as a player? I'm thinking mostly in GM-less games now, like with rotating scene framer or everybody playing the same character, but I don't think  it's really any difference between GM-less games and traditional GM-lead ones in this case. Do the character need a goal, and are we passing somewhere around the brink of roleplaying definitions if we say no to that question? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414079/#Comment_414079" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-14T16:40:23+00:00" title="May 14, 2013  4:40PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2013 4:40PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I roll and fail, my character has tried and failed.

I'm investing less, and this may well bleed into my character, so that I'm playing the character more fatalistically, so that the character is less surprised when things go south.\n<blockquote>* Also, what if the GM isn't the jerk, what if they assiduously offered you many opportunities to pursue your goal and you didn't spot them or were playing Bejeweled on your phone or were drunk or something and eventually you lost, but never <i>noticed</i> that you lost, instead you felt that your goal had been killed?</blockquote>\nYah, this is why I said it was a generalization. I've been on both sides of the gm screen where the player's been inattentive, and there's also the situation where a player is convinced there was never an opportunity, but the gm is convinced there was. Communication problem, in that case.\n<blockquote>* If I pick a character goal that's dumb or insane, am I entitled to require the GM to give me the opportunity to succeed at it?

This is a matter of good communication.<br/>If you don't tell the GM what your character goals are, then the GM is not to blame if the GM accidentally undercuts them. Communication is important, and all sides need to communicate.<br/><br/>I gm a lot better when I'm not blindsided. I understand that a lot of players don't want to tell the GM too much about what they want, and I think that some of the time, this is because the players have had adversarial GMs. Don't tell the enemy more than you need to. But, I don't want to be that kind of GM. And, I don't want to wreck your game by deciding that, say, the woman your PC is interested in has married and moved to Timbuktu simply because I had no idea that you were interesting in that NPC and your PC was interested in romancing her.<br/><br/>(I've often had this sequence:<br/><br/>Player: Is X the case?<br/>Me: Nope.<br/>Player: Ah well, If it had been, I'd have done Y cool thing.<br/>Me: Oh! You know, I like that -- we can make X be the case.<br/>Player: Nah, the moment's passed.<br/><br/>I try now for this:<br/><br/>Player: Is X the case?<br/>Me: Why?<br/><br/>To put it another way, there's a potential X-Y problem: The player asks about X, but really wants Y. The GM, in this case me, not realizing there is a Y, looks at X and makes a call, often one I don't care about either way, but I've been asked.)\n<blockquote>I guess I am trying to get at an answer to the OP that firmly says that just as in many games it is fine for a character to get killed, it is also fine in some games for characters to run into a wall, and just like in some games a character can get killed by an unlucky fluke and that's fine, in some other games you can run into a wall based on an unlucky fluke and that's fine too.</blockquote>\nSure, that's true of goals as well.<br/><br/>But, in many games, if random character death is on the table, I don't want to get too attached to my PCs.

It feels like ... if the player's and the character's goals are separated and the character has no goal, situations can create new ones. Lets say the character is a farmer living a life of it's own. A landlord may come and disturb the peace or an owlbear may one day try to kill the farmer. This is some stupid examples, but when I'm thinking about this I'm reminded of Dan Harmon's <a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" rel="nofollow">story circles</a>.

So I guess the answer to the OP question is "Yes, they are equal, but also equal to player's goals; and killing any of these isn't neccessarily always a bad thing as long as it doesn't negate a major investment from the side of the players or the GM. Anyway, it can be prevented by having a good communication between all players."</blockquote>\nI like yours and <b>komradebob</b>'s conclusions, but I wonder if the character's goal is as sacred as the player's. It feels like ... if the player's and the character's goals are separated and the character has no goal, situations can create new ones. Lets say the character is a farmer living a life of it's own. A landlord may come and disturb the peace or an owlbear may one day try to kill the farmer. This is some stupid examples, but when I'm thinking about this I'm reminded of Dan Harmon's <a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" rel="nofollow">story circles</a>. "A character in a zone of comfort. But they want something". The situation could create that something.

I once made a character whose goal was to live a normal life, ignoring that he was the Antichrist; my goal for him was to eventually get him killed doing the right thing. I'd say my goal was definitely more "sacred" in that case.<br/><br/>In cases where the character's goals and the player's goals are equal \u2013\xa0as in your original example, Rickard \u2013\xa0I feel like there are ways to <i>replace</i> those goals without it feeling like character death, but I'd only recommend it to a GM who really knows their players. I have been gaming with some people for so long that I feel like I could throw in a plot development or twist that totally negates their character's goals, but in a way my players would appreciate. (E.g., player/character goal is to be promoted by their boss, but they gradually find out their entire organization is so corrupt that it's not something they want after all. Their new goal is to expose the corruption/get out safely/find a new employer/etc.) I wouldn't try this with a player I don't know as well, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414126/#Comment_414126" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-15T12:24:47+00:00" title="May 15, 2013 12:24PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2013 12:25PM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well the entire game is mutable; character's goals can change, player's goals can change, characters can change, plots can change.
