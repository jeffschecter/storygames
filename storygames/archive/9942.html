It seems rather nice - they had 80 people last year, and they run indie games. But I get the feeling from reading the UK Role Players forum that it's all about drinking beer and playing loud games of sodomy and lesbian sex. Would I, a fairly quiet Norwegian with a love for tense, personal social realism, enjoy the con?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220824/#Comment_220824" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T15:21:30+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  3:21PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>yes. go there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220862/#Comment_220862" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T02:47:17+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  2:47AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2009 2:48AM by Matthijs.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, you're a beautiful person, but have you actually ever been to IndieCon?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220866/#Comment_220866" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T03:00:43+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  3:00AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should hide in your home and weep for the beauty of what could have been.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>P.S.

Still, brisk walks along the shingle beaches affording bracing views across the Channel, with the promise of a warm cup of greased tea upon your return, are not to be scorned.<br/><br/>The venue itself is nice. A large and warm central game hall features two nearby  pubs that aren't expensive, with a fast food doorway nearby that serves the usual turgid fare that passes for English haute cuisine: the grub is warm and slides down a treat, especially after a few shots of rum and some pints of Guinness. The accomodation is in the form of furnished bungalows: clean beds, dishwasher, cutlery, pillows, and that kind of stuff is provided. The nearby town is a mere 10 minute walk away and you can go there for a curry or to shop at the local supermarket.<br/><br/>Game-wise, the emphasis is on indie games. Indie is defined as independently published and/or indie in theme (story games, forge games). There's plenty of the type of games that folks jaw about on this forum, sitting alongside a slew of more traditional but independantly published games. Omnifray was a particular hit last year - at least, it was the game that everyone was talking about. There are 3 slots per day, running four hours each, and the gaming and organisation is good. If you have more specific questions I'd be glad to answer them. Oh, if you have games that aren't finished but that you want to playtest, then that's catered for too.<br/><br/>Lastly, Graham Walmsley is probably going to be in attendance since he was there last year. (Portions of that last sentence may not be true.) Really, is any further encouragement required? With luck, you too will be able to garner your very own "WalmsleyMo" (Walmsley Mo-ment): this is a moment that ripples across the gaming hall like a silent Mexican Wave, where everyone is recommended to unobstrusively wander past the table where Graham is playing in a complete stinker of a session, there to see him affecting a pose of studied getmethehelloutofhere, his elegant fingers thrust deep into his furrowed thespian brow. I hear it was quite fun to see last year <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I myself will be there this year, probably with some Dying Earth, Six Bullets for Vengeance, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Cheerio<br/>Rick                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220872/#Comment_220872" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T03:44:37+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  3:44AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Rick.

Ha.<br/><br/>The culture of play is... a mixed bag really. There is a social element that involves getting drunk and the games are a nice sideshow to that main activity; rough incestuous sex while gaming is near guaranteed - this is a British convention - and most especially if Walmsley is coming: last years game of Poison'd is still fondly mentioned, usually along the lines of <i>"Haha! Walmsley wanted to play posh Poison'd and we turned it into pirate bum rape-fest from the first scene. Yarrrr!"</i>. Most folks are there to game, and especially yo try out new games that they usually wouldn't go for. Quiet contemplative feedback is not high on most folks agenda - if you want some reflection post-game then be sure to ask for it beforehand.<br/><br/>I like it because it's a con just down the road from me, the venue is nice, the folks are friendly, and you get to play a whole whack of hippie games in a concentrated block of time.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Rick                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220881/#Comment_220881" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T04:55:45+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  4:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rick</cite><i>"Haha!
