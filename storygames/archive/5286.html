The first story arc of the current Brave and Bold comic series from DC (to a certain extent the current arc) has provided me with some inspiration.  Could With Great Power be run with a rotating cast of characters?<br/><br/>Or more specifically, I am imagining a situation where one set of players (and thus characters) plays out one or more (sets of) scenes, then several of the players leave and a new set come in (bringing new characters) with optimally at least one player (and character) overlapping between the groups.<br/>Wash, rinse, repeat, but the character that overlaps each time is not necessarially the same, so that even by the third set of scenes it is a completely different group of characters that started the overall story arc - but the same story arc is proceeding none the less.<br/><br/>I see a couple of challenges with this style of play:<br/>(1) Set up time for characters each time new players enter the mix.  Obviously The Struggle would carry through the whole Story Arc, but that only simplifies the process.  <br/>(2) A bigger challenge comes around the villain.  In the comic, there was a new apparent villain each issue or so.  In WGP, the villains and their Master Plans are tuned to the characters.  It feels like this could be solved through having multiple villains with multiple Master Plans, one MASTER VILLAIN for the full arc and some number of additional villains with thier own plans, a new one introduced every other group change or so.<br/><br/>Does approach seem plausible with WGP?  Are their other challenges I've not thought about?  Are there some potential benefits to playing this way?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance,<br/>Blue                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119180/#Comment_119180" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-11T18:24:24+00:00" title="January 11, 2008  6:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blue, I'm not getting this.  When you say, "play out sets of scenes," what's that mean in comics terms?  An issue?  A couple of pages of an issue?  Several issues with each little team, succeeded by a new bunch of issues with little teams?  I'd figure that out, and then look at the closest arc that fits.  The simplest way would be to do a whole bunch of "annuals" with a crossover theme.  (Marvel did a bunch of these in the late 1980s--one big villain had something in mind, and in each annual one of his minions would be the big bad guy.)  So you could just do a whole bunch of "annual" modes of play, linked together by a character here or there--maybe keeping the entire struggle intact, or just one pole of the struggle, or none.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresumably the last "annual" should be the most suspenseful, but I'm not sure how to do that mechanically.  Maybe with each annual, each hero's Strife Aspect begins at a progressively worse state... so that the machinations of the villains in Episode 1 not only endanger the Strife Aspects of the Episode 1 heroes, but also the repercussions could affect the aspects of the second batch (?).  (If this sounds contrived, it usually was.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119495/#Comment_119495" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T13:54:22+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  1:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darn good questions and comments overall, James.<br><br>Part of the problem, I suspect is I have a couple different potential applications in mind.<br/><br/>In general, if following the model of the comic, "a set of scenes" would be an issue in comics terms, yes.  Your analogy to the Marvel Annuals of the 1980s is an excellent one, perhaps even a better model than the first story arc of this year's Brave and the Bold from DC.<br/><br/>In specific, I am imagining potential demo play where over the course of say eight or so hours, I run one "story" but with a progression of players and characters.  <br/><br/>I think my questions (both those explicitly voiced above and the internal ones I've yet to put words to) may come down to the mechanical one you describe.  Or stated another way, how do you move through the story arc when the characters change every issue?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
