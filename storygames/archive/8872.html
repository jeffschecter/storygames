I'm batting around a few game ideas, but the one thats currently sticking with me is some kind of Twin Peaks + Silent Hill The Movie + Stephen King Miniseries + Carnival fiasco. Character-focused drama that involves some kind of dark supernatural element &amp; rural sensibilities, set in either modern times or possibly a recent period that would be fun to act out. Main characters may or may not have superpowers.<br/><br/>Here are my requirements:<br/><br/>* Complete game with considerable playtesting done.<br/>* Works with a campaign that goes for 8-16 sessions.<br/>* Works well with 3-6 people present in a session rotated from a pool of around 7 people.<br/>* Doesn't require rules-hacking (Unless its super simple rules-hacking that you can put in your recommendation).<br/>* Is based around a reward cycle palapable to a soapy, character-centered kind of game.<br/>* No Vampires/Werewolves/Angels/Capital D Demons<br/><br/>Here are some benefits:<br/><br/>* Rules work particularly well for horror.<br/>* A substantial amount of "The GM as Game Facilitator" techniques are laid out in rules.<br/>* Provides support for providing equal participation among players of broadly varying degrees of pro-activeness.<br/>* No 'Tinkering with my little dude until he's extremely proficient in combat according to my particular interpretation of the rules'.<br/>* Rulebook is less than 250 largish pages to 350 smallish pages.<br/>* If a person goes into it trying to play D&amp;D, the result has a good chance of being enjoyable.<br/>* The Reward system has little room for 'The GM chooses to reward people based on extremely subjective criteria'                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196230/#Comment_196230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T04:38:15+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  4:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prime Time Adventures is the game for soap opera, based as it is on the format of TV shows.

The drives provide a reward for engaging with the core of the character and the horror.<br/><br/>Buffy (or the full and freely available Witchcraft) game is adaptable to horror with many of the sensibilities of a soap opera.

It's designed for four-color superhero stories, but I think to do what you want would mostly be a setting hack, and not really require any rules changes.  It would just be a matter of requiring genre-appropriate choices during character creation (e.g., no cosmic level powers, emphasis on relationship attributes, etc.)  The central mechanic relies on inflicting pain, risk, and harm on characters' aspects and relationships, which seems ideal for generating melodramatic, soap opera-y play.<br/><br/>Where it might fall down:<br/><br/>- The structure of the game is designed around there being a "big bad" that the characters band together to defeat.  If you really want this to be about the PC-PC conflicts, it might not work that well.  But, I think it could do really well for a Buffy-style game where there's a main enemy and a general goal, but plenty of soap opera along the way.<br/>- I don't know how D&amp;D players would approach it.  "D&amp;D style play" probably won't break the game, since I'm not sure you could even do it.  But D&amp;D players may be confused and frustrated if they're locked into that way of thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196236/#Comment_196236" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T06:01:22+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  6:01AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I think Hot War might fit your requirements, sans the setting.

Players take turns putting their characters into spotlight scenes, and they choose their GM for the scene.<br/><br/>I would assume that if you go into Annalise trying to play D&amp;D, you will crash and burn very hard. By this, I mean that Annalise in no way supports Step On Up / Gamist play. It has no way to "win." The kinds of conflicts it puts characters in are the knife-twisting kind with few tactical options.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the game meets your criteria. Despite having "vampire" stuff strewn about the rules, the game's Vampire is just a metaphor for whatever creepy supernatural bad-thing is influencing your story. It can be anything, or even nothing (nothing you can point at, so it could be The Evil In Men's Hearts, or something). <br/><br/>The reward cycle centers on using mood (in the form of Claims) to influence conflicts and keeping your character strong enough to resist the Vampire's influence at the end. The game works best for longer play, not one-shots. It can produce creepy, moody play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196281/#Comment_196281" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T11:55:48+00:00" title="March  9, 2009 11:55AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can Annalise handle this part?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sean Musgrave</cite><br/>* Works with a campaign that goes for 8-16 sessions.<br/>* Works well with 3-6 people present in a session rotated from a pool of around 7 people.<br/></blockquote>\nThe rotating people part sort of makes me think that you could do this with <i>In a Wicked Age...</i><br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> or <i>Solar System</i> also come to mind for me.

The game focuses on individual stories, even when they're intersecting with other people's stories. <br/><br/>The game should also handle the 8-16 sessions requirement just fine. I've only played a couple sessions myself, but I am pretty sure Nathan has playtested it over longer periods of play. The game has a narrative structure that does push toward an endgame. That is, after 8-16 sessions, you can be sure you've told a satisfying story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196314/#Comment_196314" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T15:02:26+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:02PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Were I to use Annalise, I'd seriously consider doing appx. 5-session miniseries within the scope of a larger series.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196320/#Comment_196320" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T15:43:17+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>It's disturbing that we don't nWoD?</blockquote>\nIt's disturbing in the same way that it would be if someone said "I want a frozen dessert, something soft and sweet and cold, preferably made with cream and sugar, and I'd like it if I could eat it with a spoon or maybe even out of a waffle cone," and four replies in a row started listing puddings and creme brulee and custards and sorbets and everything <i>except</i> ice cream, before someone finally piped up with "Oh, hey, ice cream might work for you there." <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n<blockquote>The reward cycle is what you get experience points for, although, disturbingly, I couldn't say what that is in nWoD.</blockquote>\nThis may be a silly question, but...if everyone is on board with playing a soapy, character-centered kind of game at the outset, then is a neutral-ish reward cycle (like nWoD) good enough?  It doesn't explicitly state that it encourages or tries to encourage soapy, character-centered play, but it doesn't reinforce any other, opposing style either.

Luckily, I have a GamingReaver-to-HumanSpeak translation disk, and am able to speak on it furher. XPs are not a big part of the reward cycle, but <b>WILLPOWER</b> is, in the sense that you are looking for.Look at WoD, in the section of Willpower, Vice and Virtue (p 95/96) and there you have it.<br/><br/>"3 - Being able to articulate something your character learned during the session"<br/><br/>I think that's what you get XP for, but for Willpower (what you use to overcome severe obstacles, giving you a bonus to do things), you regain it in the following methods, tied directly to your character:<br/>If you do something that hits off your <b>VICE</b>, you get a point of willpower back. This can happen once per scene max (well, you can do your Vice more than once, but you only get rewarded once).<br/><br/>If you do something that hits off your <b>VIRTUE</b>, you get ALL of your willpower back. This can happen once per session max. <br/><br/>So yeah, think about the above, and you can see that at least New WoD is really "based around a reward cycle palapable to a soapy, character-centered kind of game". <br/><br/>I mean, it's not as much as "spend a Willpower, get an automatic success!", but if you want you can minor-tinker the rules to have Willpower grant you a +4 instead of a +3 to actions, something simple but potent.<br/><br/>In any case, the "Reward Cycle" comes in two parts: XPs and Willpower. XPs are not the reward cycle that gives you the Story Goosebumps, it's Willpower you should be looking into.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Oh, and the One Roll Engine (ORE) system and I had a messy fallout. Some furniture was broken, and she still has all my good CDs. I thought I loved her, but now I wonder if it was anything but hate. Fucking bitch. Anyway, the NEMESIS incarnation of ORE is free, and basically has the awesome Unknown Armies "Madness Meter" grafted on to it. Overall, it's slick, just requires a lot more numbers in abilities in order to do anything, more than the author thinks.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Oh, and on that front Unknown Armies.  The core rules take up a total of like 15 pages, and you can ignore all the magic stuff and just create normal characters (in a campaign I ran for almost a year, there were 2 magic-users and 3 normals). There's not as much of a reward cycle as WoD, but the Madness Meters are fucking cool as shit, and great for any Dark Supernatural game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX" title="RaconteurX"><img alt="RaconteurX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX">RaconteurX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196645/#Comment_196645" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T08:48:55+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  8:48AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Heaven &amp; Earth</i> is very heavily influenced by <i>Twin Peaks</i>. You'd have to tweak the setting a little to get exactly the tenor you want, but the game is chock full of vaguely creepy goodness. You might also look at <i>Mortal Coil</i> and <i>Aletheia</i>, both of which should handle your tenets pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
