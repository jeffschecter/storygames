I get it, its a lot for one mechanic to do, but I feel like I got something that works<br/>-All the characters begin with a pool of seven points (in my case check boxes)<br/>-Anything 4 or below is considered "Fatigued" which means characters flaws are getting in their way<br/>-Environmental effects can take points away (there is a move to resist this)<br/>-Can be used to take other non-lethal effects (negative outcomes from moves)<br/>-Acting out character flaws can be rewarded with points from GM  <br/>-Points are replenished upon rest<br/><br/>I am thinking that a character can use as many points as they want to add to a roll outcome, 1 for 1. And this can be done retroactively. <br/><br/>Well it feels elegant to me, I mean I love things that have a lot of utility without having to have seven different mechanics, plus I was going for a "Use as little of or as much of this as you feel is appropriate."<br/><br/>But does it work? Am I missing anything obvious. I mean I like, it but I wrote it.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455289/#Comment_455289" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T15:21:17+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  3:21PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2016 3:22PM by jangler.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, similar to <a href="http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/fate-point-economy" rel="nofollow">fate points</a> in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>As I stated in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/455105/#Comment_455105" rel="nofollow">the other thread</a>, the part I didn't like about this mechanic was that you regain points by giving in to character flaws, which doesn't make fictional sense per se. It <i>does</i> sort of make sense as a self-limiting mechanism, so that you don't enter a vicious cycle of character flaws leading to fatigue leading to character flaws.<br/><br/>By the way, in a mechanical sense, how does being Fatigued encourage players to act out their character's flaws? I think it's important that this isn't strictly forced on them \u2013 most people don't like when the GM says "your character does this", even if their character is a bit out of sorts. FATE <del>solves</del> addresses this problem by letting players spend a fate point to veto the "compel" offered by the GM (although I guess you have no choice if you're bankrupt).<br/><br/>Also, note that this point system doesn't actually <i>do</i> six things, necessarily. I would say that it <i>does</i> about two things: 1) represent fatigue/energy and 2) encourage and provide a mechanical justification for playing character flaws. The six items you listed are ways to interact with that system, not things that the system accomplishes. Maybe you don't even need all of those interactions and could make the mechanic simpler by cutting one of them out!<br/><br/>I know this comment was a lot of CC, but I think your idea is a good game mechanic if you iron out some of the remaining particulars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455291/#Comment_455291" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T15:54:39+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  3:54PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Design like this is pretty common in the more progressive end of the pool, or however one might term it. For example, <i>Primetime Adventures</i> is a relatively well known and early game that features highly interlinked mechanics, with a strong tendency towards elegance in design. There are bunches of these ("Forge games", if one wants to put a label on it, although this kind of design was never limited solely to the Forge), and I have to say that this design philosophy consistently results in games that I personally absolutely adore - I like few things as much as a powerful game formed out of a few brush strokes, each choice dripping with meaning and polish.<br/><br/>In other words, there's no philosophical or technical problem in writing a tight game where all individual mechanical concepts perform at multiple levels and feed tightly into each other. The biggest problem in my experience is really that some people don't want to or don't know how to play a rpg as written, which is a dire problem for a game that's designed to work just so - a game written as a grab-bag of specific ideas is much more resistant to arbitrary house ruling, one might say.<br/><br/>As for the specific case, nothing about the stated mechanics is unworkable per se, so if the game around that generic resource works with it, no reason why it wouldn't be good. Reminds me of <i>Dead of Night</i>, an excellent horror game that features a similarly overloaded "survival point" scheme - I'm fond of explaining the survival points to new players as "hit points, hero points and experience points all in one". Works just fine for DoN, which largely revolves around gaining and using and losing survival points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455292/#Comment_455292" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T16:09:36+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  4:09PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is true \u2013 if you acknowledge up-front that the mechanic is abstract, then fictional logic problems won't apply so much.

Unfortunately when you put people in stressful situations these things tend to pop back out. Cool heads prevail when things are going great but when it hits the fan everybody devolves a little. <br/><br/>So, why do they get points back when acting out there flaws? Because out of stressful situations we grow, and when bottled up badness gets to open air we tend to grow from it, thereby giving your character renewed strength and purpose.<br/><br/>As for making them feel forced, its more like the GM provides more opportunities for the flaw consequences to manifest whenever the GM makes a move. Lets say for example substance abuse is a flaw (like the Veteran's), When the GM makes a move when they might say the shakes are kicking in as you see the drugs on the floor, take a -1 forward while you can see it. I don't feel like that's forced per se because the GM would have already made a move in this instance, the flaw just opened up this particular opportunity.\n<blockquote>Also, note that this point system doesn't actually <i>do</i> six things, necessarily.

Your first bullet just describes how many points characters start with and reset to, but I think all the others can have specific gameplay implications. Sorry, bad critique on my part!<br/><br/>\u2026 but in a way, that's sort of illuminating in itself, since defining the scope or specificity of a game mechanic in terms of numbers is nearly always arbitrary. Take bullet 6:\n<blockquote>-Environmental effects can take points away (there is a move to resist this)</blockquote>\nYou could say this is doing one thing \u2013 emulating the effect of harsh conditions on a character. You could also say that this is doing nothing new and is just an implication of your definition of the points (do they have a name yet?). You could also say that it's doing multiple things:\n<ul><li>It increases verisimilitude by emulating the effect of harsh conditions on a character</li><li>It gives characters a mechanical reason to avoid harsh conditions</li><li>It provides an opportunity for interesting choices and consequences via the move</li><li>If the move gets a bonus (e.g. "roll+hard"), then it also increases character speciation <i>and</i> emulates the corresponding aspect of the fiction</li></ul>\nSo maybe the system by itself didn't strike me as "elegant" because it required different interactions for its different aspects, but that's subjective, and zooming in on this particular interaction and enumerating the possible gameplay implications makes the interaction seem very elegant for something that requires one roll and not too much description. I don't know what to believe!<br/><br/>FWIW, I'm a software developer by trade and I still think my definition of elegance in software is far too nebulous to be of any use. I guess the same could be said of my definition of elegance in game design!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455302/#Comment_455302" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T19:05:18+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  7:05PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said on many of your points. <br/><br/>I guess my main thing is that I'm just making sure its not inherently broken, or spirals toward some inevitable outcome as I go into playtesting.
