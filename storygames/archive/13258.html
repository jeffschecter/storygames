I wanted to cross-post here to reach a different audience. Comment on whichever forum you like!<br/><br/>Here's the post from RPGnet:<br/><br/>Qwixalted is the temporary name for my project of expanding the <a href="http://download.white-wolf.com/download/download.php?file_id=84" rel="nofollow">1st Ed Quickstart</a> and streamlining 2Es complexity until they meld into one glorious magic material amalgam. <br/><br/>Like the Quickstart, each character knows only 5 Abilities (Dawn, Zenith, Twilight, Night, and Eclipse) with each of these Abilities covering their associated skills. Abilities are rated 1-6 and they are the only dice rolled when attempting an action. <br/><br/>I took a hint from nWoD and simplified the base mechanic into Ability - Difficulty = Pool with 1 success accomplishing any task and more successes doing a better job. Combat ends up as (Ability + Weapon Damage) - (DV + Soak) and with the defender using only static values combat smooths out nicely.<br/><br/>I'm most proud of the Charm rules. Instead of trees, all Charms are reduced to 6 basic keywords. Solars have <b>Overwhelming, Range, Scope, Time, Supernatural, </b>and <b>Holy</b>. Learning a charm means buying a keyword for a skill. Blazing Solar Bolt is reduced to a Melee attack using Range + Holy.<br/><br/>I made a few very specific design choices like excluding Flurries (one attack per turn, nWoD style), simplifying combat (no DV penalties, just move and attack on your turn), and negating the whiff factor completely (Exalts roll 1 die minimum for attacks, resulting damage can't be negated by charms since soak and DV were already applied). These are problems I always had with the game and things that I feel need to change if the game is to be playable. That is, playable for me. And the shloads of others that feel Exalted is ridiculously crunchy.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B7S8NOzUyFzaYmEzY2FhZDAtNGYwNi00YTQ5LWFhYTUtYTk3OGU4MTk4MjUy&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Solars are done and done</a>. I even ran a Tomb of 5 Corners playtest on Sunday with some Exalted veterans and a few newbies. It was fantastic! The rules seemed to nicely capture everything that Solars are about. <br/><br/>A few noteworthy moments... A Melee combo involving Range + Scope + Overwhelming which took out 12 of the 15 bandits, with only a single roll and probably 1.5 minutes of game play to create the combo on the fly. There was also a flesh and armor melting Celestial Circle spell that did 5 damage to a tomb-full of uber zombies by combining Power:3 + Range:Sight + Scope:10. That spell was also created on the fly, while another character was deciding what to do on their action.<br/><br/>Something else worth mentioning, it was unexpectedly easy to convert the opposition from the Tomb of 5 Corners adventure to these simplified rules. Accuracy and DV are halved, Damage and Soak are divided by 5 (rounded up). Health levels stayed the same and the 4 or so combats we saw in the game ran perfectly!<br/><br/>Now give me the feedback! :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298502/#Comment_298502" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-27T13:43:22+00:00" title="October 27, 2010  1:43PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks promising.

I'm finally excited about Exalted again and I can't stop thinking about the project!<br/><br/>Hopefully I'll scrounge up a playtest session or two at NeonCon next weekend. :-P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298959/#Comment_298959" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-01T12:13:23+00:00" title="November  1, 2010 12:13PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarvis</cite>Solars can hit anything they can see with an arrow, triple their throwing range, shoot solar energy from their swords, jump over mountains, discern an enemies rank at 500yds (at night!) and leap 60yds during a Dodge. <b>Range</b> is <i>definitely</i> a Solar charm.</blockquote>\nFair enough.  Perhaps it's just semantic.  None of those qualities were evoked by your Blazing Solar Bolt example, but upon further review the range tag seems like a fine fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300499/#Comment_300499" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T22:19:48+00:00" title="November 11, 2010 10:19PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably worth noting that I finished a <a href="https://docs.google.com/#folders/folder.0.0B7S8NOzUyFzaNmU0YjYxYzAtYzQwZi00MDIwLTlkYWItNTZhNzc1YWNhZDVh" rel="nofollow">boat load of character sheets</a>. Solars, Abyssals, Lunars, Sidereals, Dragon-Blooded, God-Blooded, and Heroic Mortals are done and streamlined. <br/><br/>I even managed 2 rounds of playtesting at NeonCon! Everyone played Dragon-Blooded and the 'power level' of the action felt just right. Good times were had by all and now there's a handful more people waiting for a collected pdf. It shouldn't take long to complete, but I'll move a little slower since there aren't any cons coming up to light a fire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
