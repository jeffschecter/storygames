Oh yeah and a healthy since of houserules.<br/><br/>A little background. Burning Wheel is my default FRG. Three of us in the group have played various amounts of D&amp;D in it's form. One lady in our group never played it. So we all jumped in for the D&amp;D experience.<br/><br/>We rolled up characters using 3d6 straight down the stats. We ended up with:<br/>Suzrr the Barbarian Princess - Fighter; Good; Level 3; 14; 12,10, 11, 11, 10<br/>Quexel - Thief; Neutral; Level 3; 10, 12, 14, 16, 9, 11<br/>Zed - Wizard; Chaotic; Level 3; 13, 11, 12, 11, 10, 12<br/>Hirelings - Jack (half-orge) Man at Arms, Foom (the sound a firetrap makes) Gnome Torchbearer<br/><br/>A gave the premise of the adventure and read some of the author's notes and player introduction. Then I turned them loose on buying gear and such. I told everyone I would be keeping track of time, light etc...<br/><br/>About 30-40 mins real time was spent stocking up on equipment for delving. It was like watching a mini-game. All the players rolled randomly for money. Everyone figured out who should buy what and what items they really needed for a delve.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244178/#Comment_244178" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T19:49:37+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  7:49PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Starting the game: <b>POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD</b><br/><br/><br/>We started at the statue. The big pile of corpses kept the player characters away. So they immediately tuned toward the chapel. A quick ransacking of the sacred chapel and violating of the dead (by the chaotic wizard) meant the game was going well. Jack and Foom disappeared from the games fiction for awhile but suddenly reappeared when the party needed someone to touch things or go through scary doors with light. <br/><br/>The players got bored with the first level of the inn and booked it upstairs to the attic. Death on furry wings and proboscis descended onto them. A flask of oil, a failed grapple attempt, and finally fire burned the flying nasties to a crisp. There was much rejoicing as the wizard's player rolled max damage for the burning oil. The place was looted and they characters left.<br/><br/>The players decided to focus their doombringing on the stables. Somehow the horses and the stable remained unmolested (can say as much for the inn) after the PCs. came through. <br/><br/>After much discussion and prodding of the statue Quexel and a hireling pressed the plate at the based of the statue. Quexel in a show of good faith stood his ground as Jack pushed the plate in. Bad things happened but Quexel made his save and Jack fell asleep. <br/><br/>More heated discussion about what to do next. Eventually Foom, Jack, and Quexel went into the first room of the dungeon. Followed by the oh so brave Suzrr and Zed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244179/#Comment_244179" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T20:09:11+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  8:09PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Notes from the Ref Side:</b><br/><br/>Fighters get a little shafted at low levels in a OD&amp;D game. Wizards and thieves have nifty extra things. One thing I allowed: the fighter using a shield in combat, the player rolls 2d6 for damage and keep the highest. <br/><br/>Since all weapons do d6 I presume their is some fictional advantage to paying more for a weapon that eventually gets tied into a mechanical advantage?<br/><br/>Ability scores haven't been used yet. I imagine them being used like saving throws in Tunnels and Trolls. So far folks have just use the to hit roll coupled with conflict resolution. <br/><br/>I would love to see the hirelings played by players who acted like hirelings. Failing that their needs to some sort of moral check each time the hireling is sent into doom. Imagine your best trap finding, I mean light source running away. <br/><br/>The d6 for hit points using the Whitebox advancement means your character can't take a lot of damage.<br/><br/>Oh I forgot to mention Quexel wants the preserved head of the guy who built the Grinding Gear. I don't know why but that is Quexel's quest.<br/><br/>I am curious how the story process goes for building up a fiction in a game like this. Bits and pieces of story do come out in play. <br/><br/>I'll get the character sheets scanned in with the player's hand drawn map. I'll post links in the next update.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244273/#Comment_244273" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T13:54:28+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  1:54PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2009 1:56PM by Marshall Burns.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Fighters get a little shafted at low levels in a OD&amp;D game.</blockquote>\nWhaaa? I thought it would be the other way around. At low levels, wizards have very few spells per day, so they mainly do a lot of nothing and then a well-timed something, whereas fighters never run out of fightiness. At higher levels, I can easily see wizards outshining the fighters, unless the fighters have accumulated cool magic swords and stuff. (OD&amp;D's magic sword rules are actually pretty damn cool.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite><b>Notes from the Ref Side:</b>Since all weapons do d6 I presume their is some fictional advantage to paying more for a weapon that eventually gets tied into a mechanical advantage?<br/></blockquote>\nThere's nothing mechanical to it, but there are advantages and disadvantages. You can do things with a hammer that you can't do with a dagger. They're both equally good at killing people, but differently good at other things. You can smash something with a hammer, you can cut something with a dagger, and so on. Also, you could houserule a mechanical benefit by giving bonuses based on things like relative reach; <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>'s combat rules are a good reference for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
