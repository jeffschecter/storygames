We've had a lot of success in the past with Pickup-group style games -- basically, the idea that you have a group of players that's much larger than the group you will need to play any particular session, and when a play time and place is proposed, the first x number of people who are 'in' are in, and then we say "okay, that's enough -- we'll go again next week".   <br/><br/>And I'm musing over what system to use for something like this.  The last time we did it was with Spirit of the Century.  It worked pretty well, but the other GM besides myself really didn't like not knowing exactly which characters were going to be at the table until about a day before the session (I tend to make up more crap right at the table, so I don't care as much) which left me GMing all the time, which was not the intent.<br/><br/>So she asks, because this is what she does, "Why wouldn't *any* game system work?" <br/><br/>So I use DnD 4th as an example of a problem system: XP awards mean level imbalances, and while most people would be about the same level from only showing up about the same number of times, you'd always get one guy who shows up every session and was 3 levels ahead of everyone, and the other guy who shows up once every six weeks and is still level 1. <br/><br/>She gets it, but I continue on to say "as another example of a problem system, IAWA doesn't worry about xp, but when you have those cards drawn and the characters are all kind of SET, you can't just have people hopping in the next ses--"<br/><br/>And I stop myself, because I realize that ideally, the characters you come up with in one session are pretty much done at the end of the session (assuming you can wrap up to some kind of conclusion).  You get people recurring, yes, but there's no real reason that you couldn't have a rotating player base from session to session if the setting background were clear and strong enough.<br/><br/>I share this observation, but she's off on some other thought, which sounds something like this:<br/><br/>"You know, the cool thing about, for instance, Discworld, is that it kind of has everything in it.  There's the Witch stories, and the Guard stories, and the Death stories, and the Wizards with their completely different magic from the Witches, and the Wee Folk...  If you were playing something like that, it doesn't matter WHAT you were all in the mood for that week, because EVERYTHING fits... somwhere."<br/><br/>And (I imagine) I got this look in my eye and sort of said, in a dreamstate, "You could have an Oracle for each of those sort of Discworld Threads you just mentioned, and just pick the one you wanted to use that week to help do that kind of story.  And you'd still get some bleed-over from the other Oracles -- like Granny Weatherwax showing up in a Guards story, because of the We Owe list.  My god, it's full of stars..."<br/><br/>And she rolled her eyes, because the quote is silly, and I've never seen that movie anyway.<br/><br/>BUT I DIGRESS.<br/><br/>Here's my thing: I don't actually know Discworld that well (SHE is the one who's read every single thing Pratchett has ever written, not me), nor am I 100% sure I'd want to run a 'pure' Discworld game... <br/><br/>But a game that used Discworld-inspired Oracles?  Yes.  I think, yes.<br/><br/>Again, I don't really know Discworld that well, but it seems to me that there are a number of Oracles that could be done:<br/> - Guards <br/> - Witches<br/> - Dwarves<br/> - Wizards<br/> - Wee Folk<br/> - the Greater Powers (Death, the Library... I dunno)<br/><br/>So... I call on the power of the Internets?  Anyone want to toss some Discworld Oracle entries into this thread?  Fanboygeek OUT, people; show me whatcha got.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172404/#Comment_172404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T13:17:45+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  1:17PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good idea, makes good sense.
