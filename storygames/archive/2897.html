First, here's where I'm coming from: I don't know anything about your game because I haven't been keeping an eye on developments in game design lately. Also, when reading your first post, I didn't read anything past <i>Here's what I'm aiming for in the ad</i>. The folks you want to communicate with through the ad won't have that info before they read it, so I wanted to come at it as fresh as possible. <br/><br/>With that out of the way, here are some impressions, suggestions, ideas, musings.  <br/><br/>I had the same impression as Jason Morningstar about the Franklin thing. I see you've already noted that, and I think the addition of "Revere" adds an additional point of reference for readers who need to "get" the revolutionary war context when they first encounter the game. <br/><br/>Like Daniel, I didn't really get the whist thing. In fact, until his post, I didn't realize the game mechanics use cards, whist, etc.  How much do you want to draw attention to the fact that the game mechanics use cards? I notice in re-reading your OP that you didn't mention it, so there's a chance that it's not a central concern, in which case I'd suggest you might be able to do without it. As it is, as someone unfamiliar with the game, it went right past me anyway.<br/><br/>The text in the top left corner is what I read first. I think it's worth considering whether you need to to establish the "whist code" thing as the initial context for the ad or not. I'd suggest playing around with a version that kicks off with the suggestive verbal images you've placed in the bottom right text, maybe as a series of snippets rather than complete sentences. In fact, you might consider making up for lack of the gonzo visual art that Daniel wanted with one or two more gonzo allusions in the text -- get this imagery across in words if you don't have pictures for it yet. Again, as someone who knows nothing about the game, I would not have realized that mecha of leather and brass or antique light guns are possible in the game. I had no idea until I read Remi's post -- and I am exactly the kind of consumer you don't want to miss out on that. My idea of high art is robots punching each other in the face. Let me know I can do that at the Boston Tea Party, and I'm going to be looking for your game. <br/><br/>Ok, back to the text. I'm toying around with ideas here, but what if you reversed the text a bit, getting something like this: <br/><br/>[UPPER LEFT]<br/>It's in code.   <br/>Something... about the mohawks...<br/>A lost arms cache...<br/>And... of course! It's our old friend the redcoats. <br/><br/>Wake up, Revere. You're going to New Brunswick!<br/><br/>[BOTTOM RIGHT]<br/>I hope I got that right. That Franklin and his damned codes...<br/><br/>Of course, the wording is only a suggestive re-reading of what you have, so the wording is all up to you. That's just to get across an alternative arrangement of the text units. Also, if you decide to slip in an allusion or two to the gonzo, you'd probably want to slip it in the mohawks/arms cache/redcoats section. <br/><br/>Now, here's something in the ad that I love: "Coming Election Year 2008." I think it reinforces the title and revolutionary war setting of the game. It's a small detail, but a good one. That, the title, and the central image (man with raised fist) had the strongest impact on me in terms of creating interest in the game. <br/><br/>Finally, the relation between the images on the cards and the cards themselves was opaque to me until I read this thread. I saw it quite literally -- the cards look like they have images printed on them. Reminiscent of a theme deck of playing cards or a CCG type thing. I think it's a fair possibility that this is the default a lot of your audience will fall back on. Now, after reading the thread and looking at it again, is it more like -- the images on the cards are the coded referents of the cards? If so, maybe that could use some kind of visual support. I don't know what. Not a graphic designer. But as it is, they have neat, clear-cut borders, and they're neatly lined up within the cards. Those design moves may have reinforced my very literal "reading" of the relationship between the cards and the pictures on them. <br/><br/>Ok, that's certainly more ideas than you'll probably want to try to incorporate, but it's a series of impressions. Hopefully something useful in there. <br/><br/>Rich                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65956/#Comment_65956" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T23:14:31+00:00" title="April 28, 2007 11:14PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what the game's about, or what sort of game it is. I'm giving my first impressions here; they're not favorable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ad, at first glance, looks like an ad for a card game set in the american revolution. Something like those collectible card games by Eagle games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the cards in the ad look like sketches or something. They don't have any point values, they're pictures printed on playing cards, and the pictures are a mish-mash of styles - is this public domain clip-art or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlack-and-white pictures, but the card values are in color, and the background is in color. Why use color so sparingly? Why not spice up the background? Why not a cool logo?<br/>\n<br/>\n- - -<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading the comments on this thread, I gather that the game is a slightly crazy thing about "mecha made of leather and brass, antique light guns, and the incredible untold adventures of the founding fathers", and it's a story game. None of those two <i>vital</i> pieces of information come through in your ad <i>at all</i>. You need to put in more crazy &amp; more story game. DO NOT rely on people to scrutinize the cards or read the entire text. You're lucky if they notice even one picture on the cards, or read the name of your game. You really have to yell in their face.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive them a huge picture of a Franklin cyborg (use the whole page), and a heading like "The incredible untold adventures of the founding fathers". Then, a paragraph or two of explanatory text at the bottom, and your web page/contact info.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65977/#Comment_65977" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T07:27:12+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  7:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ok in reading the comments in here now i want to check out the game at least a little bit.
