My one thought is to increase the damage die to 1d12 or 2d6, but reduce the range down to something incredibly short, like 5/10.  It'll force the user to get up in the face of whatever he's fighting, leaving him open to counter-attack.  Right now the advantage of the crossbow is it's incredibly long range.

It's all about the power you use.  Some rogue powers, for example, target AC, and others target Reflex, but you're using a dagger all the same.  And one's reflex can potential be higher than one's AC, so reflex defense isn't quite the same as a touch defense from 3E.<br/><br/>Reflex represents dodging and such, while AC represents general defensive ability, being able to stay out of line of sight, presenting a smaller target to your opponent, protection from armour, etc.  Remember that it's not about dodging the bullets, it's about the shooter hitting with them in the first place, and we're not talking relatively accurate modern firearms here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222315/#Comment_222315" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T17:41:23+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  5:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the big differences in weapon types are in effect outsourced to the powers, feats and classes that actually use them.

Imagine Feng Shui with powers instead of gun fu schticks and you're there - the dual-wielding ranger/pistolier, and the fighter/arquebusier with loads of powers that push people a couple of squares back after a hit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222329/#Comment_222329" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T20:28:41+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  8:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2009 8:46PM by Logos7.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My First Impulse was something like (lets make it 2 damage dice instead of 1) but after realizing that is really kind of lame and illusionist this is what i would do. <br/><br/>Use reskinned bows (you can even go all romeo and julliet and use the name of the weapon as the name of the weapon as in the longbow assult rifle, and the short bow machine pistol or something.)<br/><br/>Make them take as long or as little reloading as is approaiate (ie flint muskets should probably take a while)<br/><br/>use these powers where required. <br/><br/>Formation Fire                          Standard - at will<br/><br/>Requires : Firearms. <br/>Area Burst 5 within 20, +10 vs Ref, X[w] where X is the number of people in the formation. everyone in the formation must reload. <br/><br/>Controlled Burst                       Standard - at will<br/><br/>Requires, Automatic or Semi Automatic Firearm<br/>Ranged 10, Dex+2 vs Ref, 2[w].

Recharging is a monster-only mechanic, first of all.  Yes, I know; why not apply it here? Still, consistency in the rules is something 4E strives for.  Something like adding a Power (Reload Minor/Move/Standard) concept, would make a lot more sense, along the lines of the items that have Power (Healing Surge).  You can gain another use of the item by spending the given action type to reload the item.<br/><br/>But disregarding that, I really don't feel bullets should target reflex any more so than crossbow bolts do.  Armour can definitely help to deflect a bullet, or mitigate the damage, especially considering these wouldn't be modern armour-piercing bullets firing.<br/><br/>Not only that, but your item-power interpretation denies the character the ability to use the weapon with his own powers, making it very restrictive, and almost pointless.<br/><br/>Hrm.  It's a tricky situation, to say the least.  You'd want to make it a normal weapon, akin to crossbows, and then perhaps make some "enchantments" for more flavourful types of weapons:<br/><br/>Piercing Weapon, applicable to guns, +1d8 crit, and with the property "Whenever the weapon is used with a power that targets AC, you may choose to target Reflex instead."  Note that that would make the gun very accurate compared to one that targets AC, as reflex is, on average, 2 points lower than AC.<br/><br/>Forceful Weapon, applicable to guns, power (encounter) "When you hit with this weapon, you may push the target 2/4/6 squares."  Crit, +1d6, push the target 2/4/6 squares.  Based on item tier.<br/><br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222339/#Comment_222339" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T00:06:58+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 12:06AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2009 12:09AM by MikeRiverso.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just realized that I'm making certain assumptions as to how firearms might be flavoured in this setting, having chatted about it a tiny bit with Ryan in real life, heh.  Now, if you want firearms to be something that are usable all throughout combat, as the might be with revolvers, you'd do best by modelling them as regular weapons.  In fact, the repeating crossbow from the Adventurer's Vault comes pretty close to how you might model a revolver.<br/><br/>However, if you want them to work like a one-shot flintlock, you'd be best going with Adam's wondrous item interpretation: make it an encounter power, rather than an at-will, and make it do more damage, and maybe ongoing damage on every hit, not just a critical.

Just "reskin" and kept rules same so no balance issues.  In game it was clear that firing creates loud noises.

You can try to play balance games by making them more powerful than crossbows (ongoing damage is one way) but nerfing them in some other way (reload isn't much different than crossbow, which is why I went with a recharge). Matchlocks and flintlocks are a pain in the ass to use and a lot of people at the time wanted to throw them away and just use their recurve bows or crossbows, which were easier to use, were more reliable, had better range, and were more accurate. Civil War muzzle loaders weren't that much better (I mean, they were a vast improvement but had similar problems).<br/><br/>If you want to fuck balance for thematic reasons, don't sweat it and just up the damage or add side-effects like ongoing damage. A good Winchester rifle is going to be a game-changer. It's going to be faster to fire and deadlier than a crossbow, with much better range. <br/><br/>Metal armor is still going to be an effective defense against firearms.

I have a crossbow, Jim has a flintlock. Mine is quiet, his is loud. He's at a needless disadvantage for the sake of color, which is exactly what turns me off about high crunch play. The more I feel like I'm twisting tumblers to unlock the ultimate combination, the less I feel like I have options in front of me. It's a delicate balance, I know; but handwaving seems to me more of a necessity for timesaving. If it's that important, I suggest taking the time to have multiple options on the table.

We wanted guns in the setting, which was a little steampunky, but it wasn't the main focus of play in any way. No one used a crossbow because why not use a gun, which was "cooler"? Noise of guns was never an issue (or a disadvantage).<br/><br/>Any discussion of advantages and disadvantages based on realism will eventually have to tackle the essential question: Are these guns actually better than crossbows? A lot of people at the time (I mean 17th Century) didn't think so. They were curiosities, at first. They were finnicky. Technology improved and for that and many other strange, historical reasons, people chose guns over crossbows. But don't just assume that all firearms are better, especially if you need stealth, reliability, speed, and so on. Matchlocks in particular *sucked*. I'm not an expert on this stuff, by any stretch of the imagination, but I did a little research for my Oxford 1605 campaign. &lt;=)<br/><br/>In the end, you choose the "truth." Decide whether or not you want guns to be more dangerous than crossbows and what you perceive the disadvantages are. Choose some rules from the bullet list I offered above and put together a package for players to play with. Change it if it doesn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222420/#Comment_222420" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T10:14:31+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 10:14AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>just build a damn gunner class.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222423/#Comment_222423" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T10:23:44+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 10:23AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd make them even harder to use, but more potent.

The centralization of armies in the hands of kings, the increase in the size of those armies, the slide down the social scale from aristocratic warriors to lower class soldiers, and the development of commerce and finance (and the focus on profit and expense that brought) is what drove armor out of the military.<br/>\n<br/>\nBluntly put, its just not cost effective to spend a fortune protecting the lives of expendable peasants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat firearms were increasing in importance at about the same time is coincidence, although largely driven by the same algebra.  Learning to fire a arquebus was vastly simpler, less specialized, and able to be performed by a wider range of people than learning to fire a bow.<br/>\n<br/>\n/pedantry                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222534/#Comment_222534" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T17:41:52+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  5:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The magic item with an encounter power targeting Reflex has more and more appeal.<br><br>The image of Fire, Drop, Draw sword basically nails it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

In fact, if you feel that damage of weapons in the game should be proportional to something like kinetic energy, then actually guns should do less damage than crossbows. For realz, yo. <br>\n<br>\nBut, that said, assuming that the world in question is still magical, fantasy, that sort of thing, then firearms should in fact be adjusted to be what you want them to be. For a Tolkienesque approach, make them dangerous not only to the target, but to the user. Thematically, you could have it where a character has to sacrifice other "real" skill to degrade himself to using such brutally simple weapons. Just an example. <br>\n<br/>\nFigure out what role you want firearms to play thematically, and make the rules fit that theme. Trying to make them "realistic" in D&amp;D would first require that you remove the hit point system...<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about it, and just make them fun in the context of the game.
