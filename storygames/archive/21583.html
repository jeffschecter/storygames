They overdescribe and I lose attention. In my own game I want us at the table to get into dialogue rather than monologue.<br/><br/>\u201cThere\u2019s a quux here, what do you do?\u201d<br/>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what a quux is, what does it look like?\u201d<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s the size of four red grapes in a ponnuki shape, what do you do?\u201d<br/>\u201cIs it moving?\u201d<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s seems to have a pulse, but it\u2019s dududum dududum, a bit of an unusual heartbeat\u201d</p>\n<p>Whereas so many DMs would be like \u201cIn the land of far away, you find yourself in the company of a rare quux, size of four red grapes in a ponnuki shape, beating to the triplicate pulse of dududum, dududum. The thought of it weighs heavy on your mind.

I can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp7ZUrZPUFY" rel="nofollow">(CW: violent horror) this as an example</a> because this guy doesn\u2019t usually GM this way when there\u2019s actually players present. In the example 18 minutes go by without a \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d. DMs take pride in being great storytellers and yarn-spinners and describers and poets. But, I want to hear what the <em>players</em> say and do.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m always trying to be brief and to be about what exits are here, what <strong>is</strong> here, what do they do?

Maybe one kind of biggish but still vagueish description in the beginning, and then you add more details as you advance. <br/><br/>I've found that also GMside descriptions feel better in systems where the mechanical resolution is really fast (speed of description, basically), so then the GM is still talking about the same amount as they would in a more mechanically complex game, but they're spending that time talking about something that interests me instead of talking about mechanics.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471814/#Comment_471814" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T06:10:46+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  6:10AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'd rather hear poems from the players than the DM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471816/#Comment_471816" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T06:19:56+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  6:19AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's totally fair! I really enjoy them coming from both playerside and GMside. <br/><br/>Also, the GM I play with is a really good poet, and she pre-writes poetry based on some important scenes that the other player and I plot out beforehand, and I find that from my POV, it really adds to the experience.<br/><br/>It's like that thing that some novels and stuff do where there's suddenly a poem or lyrics that are relevant to the thematics of what's going on and that really help establish the feel of the moment when describing it literally would potentially be hard. There's just some stuff that's easier to convey through poetry, instead of prose, tbh. <br/><br/>It's something I really value because of my focus on play being very almost literary, you know? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471820/#Comment_471820" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T07:24:24+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:24AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like writing poems and adding them to our campaign page but I'm usually careful about reading things at the table itself, when I'm the DM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471821/#Comment_471821" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T07:26:09+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:26AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's understandable!<br/><br/>My GM always asks if it's okay to do it before she does, to make sure that it isn't disrupting anything. <br/><br/>Reading poetry also is a sort-of-mechanic in Chuubo's, so also it's somewhat just playing to that as well.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471824/#Comment_471824" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T07:49:03+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:49AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2018 7:49AM by DeReel.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The same problem with teachers.

The example conversation made me go "Come on already, stop making me pull your teeth and tell me what I SEE."  In fact, after reading the entire conversation, I still don't have a good picture of the situation or even the object being described.  Is it squishy and fleshlike? Is it five pulsating crystals?  A strangely shaped balloon? Yes, it's possible to over-monologue, and you don't want to try to cover every detail, but I want enough detail to establish a rough mental outline of the scene or a picture of whatever object is currently being described without having to drag it out of the GM with a bunch of "is it...?" questions as if I were playing some sort of weird guessing party game.<br/><br/>My ideal for this situation is something like:<br/><br/>"In the center of the table, there's a quux - a sort of cross shaped formation, maybe the size of four grapes. It looks almost like it's made of dark metal, but it's throbbing softly with an odd beat. What do you do?" <br/><br/>That's two sentences before "What do you do?", and neither of them is especially long, so I really hope everyone can manage to stay awake though that epic monologue.  It also gives me more information and a clearer picture of the situation than I got out of the question-and-answer session above.  It was probably faster too. <br/><br/>With regard to the subject line of the discussion, the answer is: It depends.  If the PCs are investigating a space or interacting with an NPC, I would expect somewhat more GM talking and player talking (You'll note that even in the example given, the GM is talking substantially more than the players, even though it feels like they are being deliberately reticent) - even a simple player question like "Does the wall look like it could be climbed?" might prompt a GM answer of a couple of sentences.  But when the PCs are interacting with each other, planning, or whatever sorts of intra-group interactions the game endorses, the GM probably doesn't talk AT ALL, so the overall ratio for the session probably comes out to be roughly equal or in favor of the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471868/#Comment_471868" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T17:26:59+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  5:26PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting topic! \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As a GM [...]<br/><br/>When I realize I'm talking <i>less</i> than that metric, I tend to think the game is doing well!

My preferred games tend to be all about player empowerment, but (assuming the GM is good), I really *like* long stretches of the GM talking. I love to hear the GM tell us, in detail, about this or that. I would find this frustrating:\n<blockquote><br/>\u201cThere\u2019s a quux here, what do you do?\u201d<br/>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what a quux is, what does it look like?\u201d</blockquote>\nI'd prefer an excellent and interesting description, no matter how long it is, and I love finding out what a quux is, what it looks like, and any other relevant details. I really don't mind the GM spewing forth on various and sundry subjects and painting a picture of what we're playing or doing. If they're boring, for me, it's not because of the ratio of talking; it's about the content.<br/><br/>What matters to me, rather, is not the ratio of who talks (although that can also get important, obviously, in extreme cases), but the ratio of who's making meaningful input and making important decisions or contributions.<br/><br/>These aren't always the same. <br/><br/>For instance, let's say a player's role is to choose between two possible criminals, at a critical point in the plot, and to send one of them to the executioner. In that scene/moment, I'd totally expect most of the 'talking' to be the GM telling the player stuff about the criminals. The player needs information to make her decision, after all. However, the meaningful <i>choice</i>, here, is in the player's hands. (Let's assume that's true, for this particular example, anyway; I can imagine versions where it's not, but that's not what I'm talking about.)<br/><br/>When I run games, I'm always keeping an eye on this, and I find it totally fascinating. As a GM, I want to produce enough engaging content and detail to keep myself (and the players) entertained, but, ideally, the players have most of the meaningful input. I enjoy sessions where it felt like I was <i>playing</i>, rather than steering the game at every step of the way (which is more like work). One useful metric is, "How much of what happened could I have predicted before the session started/before a particular scene started?" <br/><br/>At the end of a session, it's usually really clear, in retrospect, and I like to think about that as a gauge for what to do in the next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471874/#Comment_471874" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T18:21:43+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  6:21PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use longer GM narration as a sort of ritual space. <br/><br/>If I go into my story voice, it's for one of two reasons:<br/><br/>1. I am setting the mood.<br/>2. I am setting the time and place.<br/><br/>For example, whenever a group goes into the Druid's Grove and then into the dungeon, they have to unlock a wrought iron gate (or climb it) and they have to push a circular plate (Imperial Key) into an impression on another gate inside a cave. This has become Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) by this point. However, I will always say something like:<br/><br/>"You carefully make your way through the northern part of the city to the Druid's Grove near sundown, when the druids leave the park and lock the gate. Once they're clear, you sneak up to the eight-foot-tall wrought iron fence with barbs on top, and Omid effortlessly picks the lock with her lock tools. The gate swings open and you make your way into the woods to the left of the path, staying out of the clear areas.<br/><br/>"A few hundred feet inside the park, off the trail, is a ridge, and a stone stair leading up to a cave in the side of the hill. It's blocked by a gate of brass bars with a rectangular brass plate in the middle. Omid pulls out her Imperial Disc and presses it into a circular impression in the plate and there's a metallic clanking in the stone around you and a sort of magical thrumming vibration. A puff of wet, earthy air escapes from the cave, obviously sealed off magically from the outside until now, and the gate swings open with a squeak."<br/><br/>This is my reminder to the players that they are leaving the city and entering a magical space, both character and player. It's a ritual that I'll bet my regular players could repeat, if I asked them to do so. It quiets the (virtual) table and gets them to focus on the game. It draws them into my world.<br/><br/>The first time they encounter a new, weird location, I will likely narrate what they see. I don't prepare text for this in advance. I loathe boxed text most of the time. I generate it from my notes, off the cuff, suited to the group and what they will see first.<br/><br/>"You've never been this far into the caves. Moving past where you were attacked by the piercers, off to the right of that area, the narrow caves open into a 50-foot-wide cave as deep as you can see. The ceilings are quite high here, barely within your torchlight. It's a sort of mushroom forest, with mushrooms growing as tall as 15 or 20 feet. But even the ground is covered with tiny mushrooms that crush under foot. The dirt is soft and squishy, moist but not wet. You can smell it too: the rich earth, the loamy mushrooms, mold and spores and mildew, and the faint whiff of death."<br/><br/>That's what a character will notice in 5-10 seconds of being in a new location. After that, I stop with story voice. Now it's exploration time. Characters interact with the environment. I check passive Perception, if necessary. I'm also using a feature-rich map in Roll20, so the players can move to things on the map and ask about them. They can SEE the monsters, if they move to the right spot (giant mushrooms literally block monsters in Roll20, after all).<br/><br/>So my goal here is to give them a flash impression of a place to make it memorable. It's also ritualistic in the sense that it reminds them that they're in a weird, new place. This is an adventure.<br/><br/>I love ritual aspects of GMing. It's the one bit of "storytelling" I get to do. The story is that they have come to this place and will encounter whatever is here, and that even that act is one of bravery, outside the realm of what normal people consider doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471885/#Comment_471885" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T19:42:34+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:42PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of the issue is how you and your group think of the game. Is it another media or a conversation? On a conversation we're used to hear someone for a while and then give our feedback with a rythm outlined by our own emotions, interests and speed of thought and people we're talking with. <br/><br/>On a media we have expectations for some particular entertainment; we want to experience emotions that could be related to a mood established by the GM or the interaction between our avatars and the fictional world. But if we're thinking of the game as a media we will probably have a bit more of tolerance, especially if our tastes are related with an slower speed of information consumption. Like, if I loved Tolkien I would probably be okay with long descriptions and even feel cheated if the GM didn't use those.<br/><br/>So, part of the issue is about tastes: some people love the long poetic descriptions, some will hate them and nobody wins when the argument is about which one is better. But there's another viewpoint about the issue that goes into efficiency, where we can say that mood can be projected with economy of words as long as you get to the point. There I agree, you don't need long GM monologues when you know how to instill the right mood into the scene or even better, follow the player's mood and fit your description there.<br/><br/>You can even play the questions game as part of the exploration: the idea is that the GM describes what the characters see, but doesn't say anything about additional information and lets them ask questions so they figure out little by little what's going on here. It could look like:\n<blockquote><br/>\u201cThere\u2019s a small thing here, the size and shape of four red grapes in diamond shape, it pulsates. What do you do?\u201d<br/>\u201cWhat the heck is that?\u201d<br/>\u201cAnybody has some Knowledge (nature)?" <br/>\u201cI do"<br/>"Then you know the thing is a Quux, a very rare creature, normally harmless"<br/>"Is it moving? Did you say it was pulsating?\u201d<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s seems to have a pulse, but it\u2019s dududum dududum, a bit of an unusual heartbeat\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nTL:DR: it depends on both your group's tastes and on how you all think of the game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/manixur" title="manixur"><img alt="manixur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/manixur">manixur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471887/#Comment_471887" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T20:00:13+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  8:00PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short poetic descriptions are also an option - that is, you can repeatedly use brief, specific descriptions to cue what things are.

The thing for me is that I look at roleplay as a piece of media that we're collaboratively creating, a pseudo-literary piece of work, so long description that really set the scene and pull everything together emotionally are something I value hugely. The story I told earlier in the thread about the GM reading poetry is a good example of that. <br/>That sort of description needs to be there for me to have what is by my standards an authentic-feeling storytelling/roleplaying experience, which means that someone needs to give those big poetic descriptions, and I'm not really particular about whether it's me or another player or the GM or what, as long as it's there. <br/>I also enjoy letting my GM in particular do that pretty frequently, because she's a really good poet and her descriptions are really pretty and immersive. <br/>And this that you're describing about the ritual elements is a really good explanation of some of my feelings about the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

For me, the perfect mood at the table is one where the players are engaged, they have their characters lifting stones, pouring flour, pondering options, talking to each other and NPCs, examining and exploring places, fighting monsters, overcoming obstacles. That, to me, triggers the magic of RPGs, the magic of teleporting your mind into a <i>shared</i> imagined space and actually playing in that space, as nothing else can.<br/><br/>And since the following example:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>You've never been this far into the caves.

When the players have to ask questions that amount to basically "Can you tell me more about what I should already know?" I consider that a place I could have done better.  <br/><br/>That means, however, that I have to talk longer if the situation has changed more radically from last time - your example seems like a "You're in the room, and you've noticed something on the table." setup.  Things like that usually don't require a lot of information.  "You've come to a new room in the dungeon." requires more, because aside from anything that's common to all rooms in this dungeon, the players have no information. "You've just arrived at the steading of Herrodsburg." requires more still, unless the players have been to multiple steadings and there are some common features they can draw upon.  \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>What I <i>do</i> want is for play to go to dialogue, interaction, as soon as possible.

You can't lift up a thing that you don't know is there. ("I lift up the cushions on the sofa." "...er, wait, there's no sofa here.");  Smelling, honestly, unless they're leaning over to take a whiff of something specific (which again, they need to know it's there) is a throwaway bit of description (Honestly, scent seems to me like the kind of thing you can skip to avoid feeling like you're bloviating. "The fetid air seems to writhe in twisted miasmas, choking your nostrils with the scent of rot!" is rubbish a lot of the time) but any sounds that are prevalent/relevant should probably be part of the description.  If the PCs have just entered an active smithy and your description doesn't contain the sound of the blacksmith hammering, I feel you've dropped the ball.<br/><br/>Player agency and player action is dependent on their having enough information to act, so you want to give them that, and not omit details just so they can "start interacting sooner" by asking "Is there a castle in the town?" ("Why yes, the ancestral keep dominates the entire town, looming upon its crag, and throwing most of the burg into shadow at this hour, why do you ask?")\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Right, I love it.

And there are probably times (The start of the session is the obvious one in my mind) where a little bit of extra exposition is not only allowable but called for.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I've actually considered (but not tried yet) some sorta "OK, everybody close your eyes.

They're going to shift into your "lifting, prying and sniffing" mode when they get past this part that is being elided by the GM as "not very interesting.'\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>a big flag for me.

All this stuff should be obvious.  I don't want people to be blindsided by "wait, there are mushrooms on the ground?" when it would be perfectly obvious to their characters.  My line for "What should I include?" is "Can the PCs tell this without having to DO anything?"   The PCs all have eyes, ears and brains, and all three of them are active at all times without them needing to say "I look at the room." or "I read the runes" (If you read Ancient Elvarion, you will read them without having to do anything. If you have to laboriously translate them, then you don't just get to "read the runes") or something like that.  PCs should be ACTING, not trying to figure out obvious details abotu their environment.  And think that's where you are struggling - you are so eager to get the PCs to DO STUFF that you are mistaking "Uh, okay, is there a light source in here?" for "doing stuff."<br/><br/>Yes, there's a grey area surrounding stuff like looking at the ceiling, which can be construed as a thing that many people would have to consciously do, but even that is situational - if you've just entered a massive cavern, and the far reaches are dark beyond the edge of your torchlight, you are probably looking everywhere.  If you've just entered Thomas Smithington's drawing room, then checking out the ceiling is unlikely to be something you instinctively do.<br/><br/>Yes, there's room for some weird poetry too, where you spend a couple of sentences describing, I dunno, the reflections in a crystalline stalagmite, <br/><br/>Sorry; That was a really long wall of text that basically says "How much the GM should detail depends on the situation, but I'd rather them err on the side of more information than less.  However, 'words' should not be mistaken for 'information' and conveying the same amount of information in less words is usually better."  along with some disagreement on the idea of whether players should have to ask more questions to get obvious info.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472011/#Comment_472011" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-15T21:21:17+00:00" title="April 15, 2018  9:21PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Now, Adam, you and I are among those who most often agree on this site so I'm hesitant to argue against your post and when I see what I'm writing, I look so harsh and disrespectful.

Players can ask as if they were exploring and if it is a dark dungeon then it makes sense passive perception tells them as much as the GM does, meaning they have to get their torches closer to anything they want to see.<br/><br/>Player authoring the world through their questions may be more than it seems.<br/>Like, if there are giant mushrooms visible in the room, the GM will of course tell the players about them, but how sturdy they are may come into player's authoring, which the GM will most probably feel to give it a go to see what the players make of them (Hey, an staicase of mushrooms, that's an awesome idea!)<br/><br/>I've seen cunning players introduce bits of harmless information that make sense in the scene, but later become a really important tactical advantage. For me it's like the natural thing a hero in a book would do and the main reason I like it and let players get out with it. Of course, I never prep those things for them in advance because there's no way to predict things like that. But adding detail to your descriptions is often a way to inspire the players to think of these things. When it happens it even feels like cheating to take away those advantages for them.<br/><br/>So, a loose description works better in this case by giving the players inspiration but leaving room enough for them to introduce reasonable details that doesn't contradict the GM's description and that they can turn into tactical advantages later.<br/><br/>All right, so you either describe for a bit of mood to generate immersion in the fiction or to stablish fictional data for the players to immerse in the tactical game; or present a basic wireframe that players can fill by asking questions as an option to immerse in the tactical game from another point of view.

If I have a concise description ready, I'll offer it: "As you open the door, you see the baron, a short, vaguely haggard guy, sitting in an overly ostentatious chair at a similarly decked-out desk in a surprisingly small room," and no more.  If I don't have that ready, I may forget entirely: "As you open the door, you see the baron."<br/><br/>On the other hand, if <i>the players are in a curious, probing mode</i> when they enter the baron's chamber, I'll take as much time to characterize it as is interesting to me.  I'll try to use the d\xe9cor to hint at the baron's attitude, his history, and how this part of the world differs from the PCs' home.  Usually this will set the stage for the players to either like or dislike the baron, and to suspect him or not suspect him, which may be vastly important going forward.<br/><br/>And, finally, when <i>the players are in full-on detective mode</i>, well beyond "curious", inclined to inspect every object for danger or clues, then I just give them the immediate facts.  They'll delve deeper; I just need to lay out the field of stuff they're about to inspect, by highlighting anything that might look dangerous or informative.  "The room is small.  The doorway is narrow, so you have to enter one at a time.  The baron is wearing some uncommon jewelry.  He looks vaguely haggard.  There's something strange about the paneling behind him.  His ostentatious, high desk conceals whatever he's doing with his hands, as you see his arms move."  Soon the players will be asking follow-up questions about most of those details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472058/#Comment_472058" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T17:07:24+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  5:07PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a fantastic point, Dave.

(The laughter of the children wasn't meant to highlight the evil nature of the PCs' actions, in other words, but to remind, perhaps, for the need to maintain secrecy, or to show their alienation from the "normal world".)<br/><br/>There's lots of fun to be had there; sometimes imagery can be really powerful.

It's like asking for initiative. I don't do it that often. Also, I am doing it because they have interacted with the environment in a way that warrants me presenting new data to them, so they're interested in hearing it. <br/><br/>And I don't drone on and on, usually. <br/><br/>My adding "faint whiff of death here" at the end of that paragraph isn't a mistake. It's actually a teaser and if they don't notice, that's fine. It's a faint whiff, after all. If it were an overwhelming stench of death, I'd have mentioned it first. I try to prioritize the information I feed back to them in order of likelihood they'd notice it.<br/><br/>I'm running these games online--voice only, no video--so that may change how I'm describing things. I would need to pay attention to how I run f2f games to describe how my techniques there differ (if at all).<br/><br/><b>Roll20 factors</b><br/><br/>It totally just occurred to me how much of my choices about what to say is colored by the toolset I'm using (Roll20 with advanced features turned on).<br/><br/>A lot of these words I'm saying reinforce what they're seeing with their players' eyes, as this is on Roll20 and I have set up Advanced Fog of War and Line of Sight (they move around somewhat freely, within the boundaries of the dungeon, and can only see what their character can see with darkvision and torches). I populated the mushroom cave with a hundred giant mushroom icons of a dozen or so varieties, but some of them block light and cast shadows. Also, we don't need to talk about exits, because they'd just see exits, if visible. Note that Sandra might see an exit, but Paul might not be positioned to see it, because of the way the Roll20 tools work. For that reason, I don't describe them unless they're really obvious and unobstructed. But since the players can totally see a wide cave with a lot of mushrooms and no end of the cave in sight, I tell them that verbally to explain/reinforce what they're seeing on the interactive map tool.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472092/#Comment_472092" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T19:01:51+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  7:01PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2018 7:06PM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (the forum ate part of my post, trying to retype from memory)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This example <i>supports</i> your point; it's not intended a challenge to it - exactly the dynamic you're describing.</p></div></blockquote>\nI liked it\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think the experience of watching someone else's game and the experience of being a player in a game are completely different.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's certainly true.

It wasn't something he did all the time.  Maybe he did it for me cuz I was new to the group?  Not sure.  I'm not sure if I've <i>ever</i> played with a DM who did that all the time.  I might have to leave that game.<br/><br/>The only difficult part of my experience was that I had to raise my voice and talk over the DM's attempt to move on to the next player, as no one expected me to speak there.  So it was probably more like, "NAH!  DURKOA'S ACTUALLY!  MORE SCARED!  than reveling in bloodlust right now..."  <br/><br/>*sigh*<br/><br/>I am lucky that I can be loud when necessary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472111/#Comment_472111" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T20:14:29+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  8:14PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That DM then ended up becoming the best DM I ever had and the reason I came up with all of the stuff I still rely on today btw\u2665 he really took my complaint to heart                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472113/#Comment_472113" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-16T20:19:10+00:00" title="April 16, 2018  8:19PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh nice!

I mean, I'm not debating that story voice causes you to zone out. I'm just curious if my shorter narratives, in the context of you playing in my game rather than watching my game, would also cause you to zone out. Probably! <br/><br/>Note, however, that "I zone out and don't hear any of your story voice narration" defaults to your preferred form of play: Back-and-forth interrogation about the environment. You just might end up asking stuff I already told you about, but that never bothers me.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Yes, but, also, doesn't the mic+webcam+mutebutton+lag+etc setup afford longer sentences and less of a back-and-forth?<br/>So many of the Roll20 games I watch tend to go that way.

I spend a LOT of my time at work on conference calls, so I'm very comfortable with the medium. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say my games have more of a PbP feel. <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> played in one, so he might be able to comment. I think there's the normal bit of give-and-take.

play.<br/><br/>I really liked the "ritual story voice narration" which kicked things off, because after that it was all play all the time. A really nice way to transition from "social talk" to "play", and Adam handles it really well.<br/><br/>However, I would say that, <i>in general</i>, online play tends more towards people talking for longer periods of time, because interrupting each other is much more difficult and much more annoying than face-to-face (you can't as easily - or at all, without video - judge body language to figure out when to step in). Some games (especially with lots of tactile mechanics) run noticeably slower.<br/><br/>As an except to that rule, we've been playing Sorcerer, and we've discovered (somewhat by accident) that using a dice roller which automatically sorts the results means that rolling dice and resolving actions is actually much faster than at a real table!

I think the balance is a little different in that format because it's quicker to read than talk and because the players can always scroll back up to read what was said previously. <br/><br/>I tend to think of this as being like the cutscene in a video game: there's a nice high-resolution video of the scene that doesn't take too long, then the video stops and you get to do things again. If the cutscene is too long, not interesting, or very different than the interactive part of the game, the players will be unhappy. <br/><br/>I also try not to describe the player characters doing things, but I like to point things out to specific characters based on their characteristics: "Bob notices that the man's suit is hand-tailored and very expensive" even when they're part of the general description.

I think I can count on one hand the number of times the phrase has been used in my group's current campaign, and all of the times in question were situations where it was extremely unclear whether or not the person who ended up asking it was finished talking, and we were sitting there looking at them for a couple of seconds so that if they weren't finished, we wouldn't interrupt accidentally, and the phrase was used to signal "I'm done speaking here". <br/>We typically are just free-flowing from person-to-person as far as dialogue and narration goes, with it being it very very clear who should be speaking when and how it should go. <br/><br/>And like, at first glance, I was about to disagree with you about the "what do you do?", but then when I thought about it, I started to realize exactly how much you're right, and exactly how much I agree with you.<br/>So thank you for making me think about stuff like that! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472686/#Comment_472686" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T09:05:44+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  9:05AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2018 9:12AM by 2097.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard" rel="nofollow">Rickard</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>There are 101 other ways of leaving over the word to the players</p></div></blockquote>\nYes, and those are all fine and I count them as valid ways of saying "What do you do?" in another way.<br/><br/>What's important is the act of leaving the word in their hands.<br/><br/>I personally love the ritual phrase because having a consistent prompt is good UX. It helps me remember to give them the word and it helps them understand that it's up to them what to do.<br/><br/>But as long as you're letting the players choose and express what their characters do, the actual <i>words</i> aren't the point. If you have a certain way of looking at them, a certain way of raising or lowering your tone, a certain pause between your words, a mix of various phrases to use etc etc, you're golden. If in doubt, use "What do you do?".<br/><br/>So I wonder if either:<br/><br/>A. We have been taking each other too literally: we both actually DM pretty similarly it's just that you don't use the actual words "what do you do" but instead like 101 other words/gestures. And the argument is just semantics, we've interpreted each other too literally. Ska ta detta p\xe5 svenska ocks\xe5: att det verkar n\xe5n sorts extrem bokstavstolkande ordm\xe4rkande p\xe5 g\xe5ng? Antingen \xe4r det s\xe5 att du ocks\xe5 tycker det \xe4r viktigt att bolla \xf6ver till spelarna, bara att du av n\xe5gon outtalad anledning r\xe5kar vara tr\xf6tt p\xe5 just <b>orden</b> "vad g\xf6r ni?". Och isf tycker jag det \xe4r ingen st\xf6rre grej att haka upp sig p\xe5? Du tycker just dom orden \xe4r fula och du s\xe4ger/g\xf6r/viftar med andra promptar ist\xe4llet. Det vill s\xe4ga vi g\xf6r samma sak \xe4nd\xe5.<br/>B. You are doing something completely different and if so we have deeper/wider differences that no amount of discussion about the particular word choice can solve. Dvs men om det verkligen \xe4r s\xe5 att du <b>inte</b> bollar \xf6ver till spelarna, isf \xe4r det verkligen en wtf \xe4r det d\xe5 som p\xe5g\xe5r. Att dom ska sj\xe4lvmant g\xf6ra saker? Ja om dom g\xf6r det, och om alla runt bordet \xe4r engagerade, i dom stunderna beh\xf6vs inga promptar, inget bollande. Det vanliga \xe4r dock att det \xe4r n\xe5gra spelare som verkligen grabbar tag i ratten och d\xe5 kan det vara l\xe4ge att v\xe4nda sig till n\xe5gra av dom lite t\xf6ntigare och bortkommnare spelarna och fr\xe5ga "vad g\xf6r <b>du</b> n\xe4r det h\xe4r h\xe4nder?" s\xe5 att dom ocks\xe5 f\xe5r vara med lite.<br/><br/>Eller att ni inte har en tydlig SL/RP\u2013split? Men d\xe5 \xe4r ju \xe5sikten helt irrelevant f\xf6r dom speluppl\xe4gg d\xe4r det finns en tydlig SL/RP\u2013split. Liksom det \xe4r inte som att jag fr\xe5gar "Vad g\xf6r ni" n\xe4r vi spelar typ Microscope eller Trivial Pursuit. Det g\xe4ller bara n\xe4r vi k\xf6r ever-lovin\u2019 D&amp;D!<br/><br/>But it's like the contradicting experiences we've had with with "describe then roll" vs "roll then describe" (a la Matin\xe9e); both of us have tried both styles and had opposite preferences. Some rulesets enforce "describe then roll" (for example Apocalypse World), others enforce "roll then describe" (for example FFG SW), and some can be mangled interpreted either way. I feel like "roll then describe" mess with my stance groove: it forces me to act out something that has already been determined, making me feel more like a stage actor acting out a cool stunt, and less like an experiencer of an adventurous world.<br/>I'd really like to show you my game and I'd like to see your game. There are so many mysteries about the relative benefits and problems with our respective styles, still.<br/><br/>My experience with explaining or reiterating the situation and asking them what they do has been amazingly powerful. It can jar them loose from hesitation or squabbling, it can turn them from waiting for the DM to do things into people who themselves do things etc etc. I like the prompts because it really accelerates everything and snaps everything into razor-sharp focus.

It's way better to talk than type. It's easier to clear out any misunderstandings. That's why I keep posts short most of the times nowadays so people have a chance me to correct or ask me to elaborate.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472697/#Comment_472697" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T09:59:17+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  9:59AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u2665                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472710/#Comment_472710" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T15:00:04+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  3:00PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Taking something from delivering lectures and seminars here, there are times and places for both styles.<br/><br/>The lecture style, where the GM presents information, is best for delivering information on which the players can base their next moves. It is no good asking 'what do you do' if the players don't understand the situation in which they find themselves. However, just like a good lecture presentation, the information should be delivered as concisely as possible. There is room for flavour description but not if it turns into a 30 minute monologue.<br/><br/>The seminar style, which is more of a Q&amp;A, works off the back of the initial lecture. The players now have the information and it is up them what they do with it. This is where the 'what do you do' becomes essential.<br/><br/>The initial monologue is the opening credits to a film or the essential backstory ('long ago, in a galaxy far far away'). It might be a description of the marketplace or the cavern. Importantly, it should include all the information that the players need to make their decisions. Missing out little details such as the patrol of armed guards or the fact that the marketplace appears to be deserted is inexcusable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472713/#Comment_472713" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-22T16:13:52+00:00" title="April 22, 2018  4:13PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me I can read books and I can read comics but a lot of media that those two up (like Howard the Duck vol 1 issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2316&amp;Mode=like">#16</a> that thas prose pages) tend to be frustrating and boring to me, having to shift gears.
