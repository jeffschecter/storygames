What, you think we want you waste 1/4 of our session trying to avoid engaging with the material the GM has prepped?<br/><br/>I've always been intolerant of GMs fudging rules, but I think players who refuse to play within the bounds of the written system are bad too.  Because in a functional version of the setup I've described, the players may not have much choice over what the adventure is, but they do have full mechanical support for deciding to engage in that adventure and working through its obstacles.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307455/#Comment_307455" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T13:32:21+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  1:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This issue kinda came up the other day at Burning Wheel with me and Matt playing. We were fighting an evil summoner and trying to sacrifice him to a demon for poetic justice reasons, but the GM told us that the sacrifice had to happen at a certain place for metamagical reasons which we hadn't yet learned about because that's just how the GM envisioned the summoning system working in our game world. Matt was upset with that detail of the summoning system at first because (and correct me if I'm wrong, Matt) it didn't have anything to do with our characters' beliefs, it wasn't hard-coded into the summoning rules, made our PCs' fight with the evil summoner less convenient, and a few other things, but the GM wanted to stick with it because he'd always imagined summoning working that way in our game world and he just really liked the idea of summoning working that way, being as he happened to play all the summoners in the game. I ended up siding with the GM, even though the decision made my PC's life more difficult, just because the GM really seemed to enjoy summoning working in such and such a way, and justifying it by saying "Say Yes goes both ways."

Actually much more nuanced than what I was thinking of.<br/><br/>I was thinking of some railroady games when the GM had a really cool plot going on, and the players were genuinely interested in the cool plot, but hamstrung themselves by approaching it from a character-first perspective.  I enjoyed several of these games much more than my friends did, because I said, "Fuck the desire (X) I initially conceived for my character; I want to help the GM tell his cool story, so now my character wants Y!"  It wasn't a matter of resignation; it was about identifying where the fun in this particular game was to be found, and pursuing that.<br/><br/>Now, the game activity wasn't pitched as being that, so I can't blame the other players for being grumpy about unfulfilling realizations of the agency that had been promised to them.<br/><br/>I would like to see a pitch, though, that <i>does</i> say, "follow the GM".  I'd play that game.  One inspired GM and 4 players looking to plug into his story might be more feasible than 4 inspired players and a GM keeping up with all of them.<br/><br/>We just need to ensure that the players know how their input is valued.  It could be a GM who says, "Yes!  Awesome!  I was hoping you'd go there!" a lot.  Or it could be a mechanic like Legends of Lanasia's <a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=423&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Destiny Points</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307463/#Comment_307463" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T15:08:44+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  3:08PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only went along with it because (a) it didn't really matter in context\u2014we couldn't have sacrificed the evil summoner anyway, since his soul was tainted and (b) there are no PC summoners, as you pointed out, Mendez.

Can we get better at locating their fun, too?</blockquote>\nSo, I think it's time for me to talk about my incomplete-but-mostly-there game <i>Showdown</i> (nothing to do with Seth's game\u2014parallel evolution, there).  The idea behind the game is to emulate the genre of classic 80's and 90's action movies like <i>Die Hard</i>, <i>Lethal Weapon</i>, <i>The Rock</i>, <i>Air Force One</i>, and so on.  It does so with a scene structure and very strict rules about what kinds of stakes are appropriate, so that the Hero is never killed, and the Villain is never killed before the Showdown.<br/><br/>At first, there was an actual GM and the GM played the Villains (the main Villain and also the Lieutenant Villain).  By the third playtest, I pretty much abandoned that idea.  Now, it plays with 2, 3, or 4 players, with 4 being the ideal.  <br/><br/>With 4 players, there are two pretty much co-equal* Hero characters/players, 1 player playing the Lieutenant Villain, and 1 player playing the main Villain.  The Lt. Villain isn't necessarily a less interesting role than the main Villain, even if s/he has less fictional power, because the Lt. Villain can potentially be turned to the side of the good guys (see Return of the Jedi), and as such is potentially a more ambiguous role.<br/><br/>So, in a way, there is a "GM" (the unequivocally evil Villain) and "players" (the other three main characters).  But everyone has responsibility for playing NPCs in scenes where their PC, whether Hero or Villain, isn't involved.  (For instance, in a 2-player game, the Hero player has to play the Lieutenant Villain during the Villainous Interstitial scene [inspired by the "What is thy bidding, my master?" scene from Empire Strikes Back].)  I basically consider it a GM-less game, but there is a very specific and distinct sort of fun to be had from playing the Villain as opposed to playing either the Lt. Villain or one of the Heroes.  For instance, to play the Villain well, you have to understand that you're not going to be able to pull off your Nefarious Scheme, and are fairly likely to get killed, but you can play the Villain with flair and style.  Jim Crocker did this amazingly well when we played, creating a Villain who was extremely suave, sophisticated, and well-realized.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Interestingly, on a podcast, Rob Bohl once described the game as having a primary and secondary Villain and a primary and secondary Hero.  I think that has to do with the specific way the roles broke down in the game of it we played in, but it's certainly interesting that it can break down that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307516/#Comment_307516" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T10:34:50+00:00" title="January  9, 2011 10:34AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>But, if you're really trying to latch onto what the GM thinks is cool, and engage with it as fully as possible, and make it cooler, I think you'll do better than that.

I've definitely done that, as a player: participated in games basically to witness the "GM's Super plot". It can be enjoyable, for sure, especially with a very skilled GM.<br/><br/>I've seen this style of play done well in one-shot situations. Everyone knows that playtime is limited, and the GM's clearly prepared something. So, let's try to get to it as quickly as possible! (Or maybe, more rarely, "as <i>well</i> as possible".)<br/><br/>The question is: what's in it for the players? How can we make that kind of thing functional?<br/><br/>And is something like Trail of Cthulhu a system that is designed to facilitate this kind of play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307540/#Comment_307540" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T13:22:07+00:00" title="January  9, 2011  1:22PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2011 1:24PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh:<br/><br/>I do this in my TSoY one-shots. I put out a list of stuff in the setting, or stuff I'd like to see in play, and just plop it down on the middle of the table. Each "thing" on the list has an XP reward attached. It's inspired by "key scenes" from the original text, but I don't think Clinton intended those to be public (then again, maybe he did). For instance, I have stuff like:<br/><br/>"The hidden treasures of Captain Griffin. 2 XPs"<br/><br/>So, any interaction with those treasures gives the players 2 XPs. I don't care if they steal it, or sell it, throw it into a pit, or give it to charity, or use it to power a magical ritual. It's open-ended, but it says, "Hey, players, I have something prepared about this treasure, and if you'd like to interact with it, you get some points."<br/><br/>I also have stuff I'd like to see in play, like:<br/><br/>"A Tchegaran sets foot inside the Church for the first time. 3 XPs"<br/><br/>Here I don't have any plan, or anything prepared. I just think it would be cool to see this change in the setting (in this particular case, we're talking about a fictional group of people who have been banned from the Church). <br/><br/>Again, I don't care if a character forces one of those guys into the church at gunpoint, or dresses up as one and pretends to come in to pray, or whether they endorse a ruler who allows them back into the churches. <br/><br/>I've had fun with this sort of thing, although I haven't explored it all that much. <br/><br/>My Lady Blackbird hack used stuff like this, too, inspired by Jason Morningstar's "Death School": there are Tags and one-time Advantages that suggest certain actions or events in play. I think one of the other LB hacks had this, too--"My Darn Ex-Wife". Here's a quote:\n<blockquote><br/>One of the cleverest parts of My Darn Ex-Wife is how character growth is written into the traits and tags of the characters. The most obvious examples are the Earth skills that are applied to outer-space - Trucker * [Space Trucker] or Ex-Quarterback * [Tauron Gravball]. But there are other nice touches, like Kind-Natured * [Good Husband]. I should have done something like this, particularly since these are supposed to be less experienced characters than those in Lady Blackbird.</blockquote>\nIn that scenario, the designer is clearly flagging his desire to see this American trucker get involved in a game of alien "Gravball", even though nothing about the scenario or character makes this necessary. But the presence of those future Tags gets us all thinking about it.<br/><br/>What other games include this kind of thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307585/#Comment_307585" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-09T18:25:18+00:00" title="January  9, 2011  6:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must enter a trance state.

I've often used a wandering monster mechanic as part of my prep by going through each aspect of the setting that's become meaningful in play, and rolling a 1 in 6 chance that something happens to shake it up. What I did this weekend was to make this an explicit part of play at the start of the session by:<br/><br/>- getting the players' input as to which things they thought were meaningful / worthy of having their own momentum in the setting even when the PCs weren't pushing them <br/><br/>- dividing these up into categories (Law, Neutrality, Chaos, and Planes) each of which got their own event check (since checking for each of the 20+ individual things would have resulted in more "hits" than I wanted). Last time Chaos came up so I rolled on its sub-chart to determine that it was the frost giants that were active within the chaos category.<br/><br/>- making a second roll to determine whether this was a background action (the frost giants are doing something offscreen) or a foreground one (the giants actively screw with the party here and now). This involved talking with the players to evaluate what the giants knew about the party, what intermediaries the giants had to work through, what actions the party had taken that made it harder for the giants to strike at them, etc. We decided this was a 1 in 6 chance, which didn't come up, so instead I told them that a volcano in the region had erupted and has been belching smoke day and night ever since. There was an interesting meta-effect in that everyone knew the random check had come up "frost giants", but they associate this volcano with the dragon Scather - so the procedure gave the players some information about a connection between them that isn't available to their characters. This could also track dynamic events in play and create goals for the players - "we're really afraid of the Assassin's Guild, what can we do to make it less likely that they will be able to send someone after us?"<br/><br/>Since I do in fact color my dice numbers with crayon, I will attest that this is as much killer-DM showmanship and magic-trick misdirection as it is hippie transparency and collaboration: "Behold, worms, how very many ways I have to crush you! Each and every one of these threats is capable of annihilating your hopes and dreams without any aid from me, so I will let the dice choose. Perhaps this session you will get lucky and continue to pursue your own schemes without interference; it is of no concern to me, since sooner or later your number will come up..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307654/#Comment_307654" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T10:40:17+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 10:40AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.

Players roll to see which of those the PCs go after.  <br/><br/>This would be good for GMs who like authoring lots of plots and factions but don't want to take responsibility for interrelating them, pacing reveals, and coordinating what's played when.  If the GM has no idea whether the giants and dragon are connected, but the PCs go after them in sequence, now the players have to come up with some theory for why, and the GM can use that for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307655/#Comment_307655" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T10:49:23+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 10:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can help make sure that our next sometime matches yours <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://redbox.wikidot.com/forum/c-61198/scheduling" rel="nofollow">in the scheduling thread</a>!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wandering monster mechanic tends to take responsibility for pacing, timing, etc. out of both the players and GM's hands. Deciding what stuff is out there was largely due to my GM-input. Deciding where to go is largely due to player input: their desire to go to towns caused me to create more town stuff, for example. The interconnections are often inspired by player action - when they go somewhere unpredictable and I need to create adversity, I reach for my sheet of what's out there and look for antagonists who might have an improvised reason to get involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307657/#Comment_307657" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T10:50:46+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 10:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br><br>I don't see how bribing the players with XP to check out the GM's cool stuff is much different than the traditional agreement that dungeons have treasure.<br/><br/>I can follow a bribe with or without really investing in helping the GM realize his material's full coolness.

We're trying to aid a conversation between the players and the gm.  You gave the example of where you went with the flow of what a gm wanted and you had more fun than some other players.  I can tell you I have had almost exactly the opposite experience where everyone went with the flow of what the gm wanted from the game and it fell flat because it ended up interesting nobody, not even the gm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is the problem with overplanning things.  So if you lay out something like "the cult wants to initiate you" and the expectations are that the players will jump right in and get initiated then follow it up with another hoop like the "cult leads the players to their secret lair" and another like "and now you discover the truth depths of their evil" and one more like "the players turn on the cultists and kill the high priest destroying the cult" might sound cool but if the players are just jumping through hoops the whole way then it becomes pretty lame and if they dont have to jump through all the hoops how do they know the difference between the ones they should be jumping through and the ones where they are free to decide?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307688/#Comment_307688" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T13:32:25+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  1:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there's a thin line there. When I wrote up my "key scenes" I wanted to make sure they could be interpreted in a lot of different ways, so no single one said to the players, "You must do <i>this</i>." There must still remain a question for the players to answer, and the question must be open-ended, I feel, for it to be interesting.<br><br>Let's try to explore the boundaries of this:<br><br>For instance, let's say you have a scenario where some valuable Thing has been stolen by a mighty dragon. It's some doo-dad that belongs to the royal family, but the peasants say that it was stolen from their forefathers a few generations ago... and the nomads in the forest need it to continue their primitive lifestyle. A tangled mess of some kind. Now, the "key/flag" is something like, "The [treasure] is returned to its rightful owners."<br/><br/>The players can see that the adventure is about getting the treasure from the dragon and giving it to someone. But how will they acquire it? And who will they give it to? Maybe they even get the Bennies if they decide that <i>they</i> should be the rightful owners.<br/><br/>In this sense, I like the example, "The cult wants to initiate you." It could go all sorts of different ways.<br/><br/>Here's a thought experiment, based on some unholy mismatch of D&amp;D and The Shadow of Yesterday:<br/><br/>The characters are adventurers looking for treasure. The GM creates monsters, treasure, and a variety of setting elements which each come with a Key. For instance:<br/><br/>The Cult of Geonorius<br/>1 XP: A new secret pertaining to the Cult's ritual traditions is revealed.<br/>3 XP: One or more Player characters are offered initiation into the Cult.<br/>5 XP: The Cult leader issues a death order on one or more of the Player characters.<br/>Buyoff: The Cult is destroyed or driven underground.<br/><br/>The GM collects XPs each time the players hit one of these Keys. In turn, s/he then spends those points to create funky magical items for the players to discover, in addition to the treasure they would normally receive for defeating the monsters. The items should have some kind of connection to the elements from which the XP is generated (in this case, maybe they are items of significance to the Cult, or stuff that's been stolen from the Cult).<br/><br/>The more the players hit these Keys, the more rewards they stand to gain, and the more the GM fleshes out some aspect of the setting.<br/><br/>Pretty half-baked, but hey, why not?<br/><br/>Let's do some other examples based on other games' flagging mechanics! Thought experiments are fun.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307701/#Comment_307701" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T14:55:59+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  2:55PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the reason why GM keys are redundant for me is because...well, here's what I want as a GM:<br/><br/><br/>1) I want to toss out an idea to the players.<br/><br/>2) Then I want the players to cause the idea to evolve based on their character choices.<br/><br/>3) Then I want the idea to gloriously mutate before our eyes as their decisions kick in the world's teeth.<br/><br/>That is what I want but I'm not married to any one piece or part of the game to get that done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307707/#Comment_307707" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T15:24:33+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  3:24PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd, for what it's worth, I agree with you.

Well, that's not the only way to play!"</i><br/><br/>For a huge portion of the RPG hobby, probably the majority, players do follow the GMs lead (sometimes knowing it, sometimes not). The "watch player flags" is so often said because it is so rarely done.<br/><br/><br/><i>"What about the reverse? What if the players, instead of worrying about their own damn characters so much, worried about giving the GM what the GM wanted? But, y'know, willingly, as opposed to some necessary evil? Watch for the GM's flags! Jump at the stuff that the GM cares about! Players can take their turn being enlightened too."</i><br/><br/>In Call of Cthulhu, this is pretty much what happens. GM determines a series of clues (sometimes linear, sometimes not) that the players follow in an effort to uncover the often very limited GM chosen ways to solve the larger problem. Sometimes in CoC, the players don't even make their own characters. And for the most part, players love it. They don't call it a railroad, but rather a roller-coaster.<br/><br/>Modern D&amp;D is not always as predetermined as Call of Cthulhu but in some ways can be more so! The players follow the GM's lead to the point where the GM predetermines the exact fights you are going to get into, against who, the reasons for it, the fallout for failure, and the rewards for success. Call of Cthulhu can actually be more player driven. Although the players decisions in CoC may not affect the plot, they often do determine their own fate. There is no guarantee in CoC that you won't fail or succeed but die or go crazy. In modern D&amp;D, failure is rare and often the system is carefully designed to make success a foregone conclusion and where the system fails the GM is encouraged to cheat the game. <br/><br/>In general I've seen players in modern D&amp;D less excited to go on the rollercoaster as they are in CoC and require more bribes / rewards. Often the compromise is the GM gets to tell their story while the players get to play out tactical challenges and grow more powerful. For some player's, the game could actually be story free but someone needs to run the monsters. So controlling the story becomes the GM's payment for running tactical challenges. But when the players don't care about the story at all, the relationship can grow tenuous and you see a lot of players jumping ship to computer games or boardgames. <br/><br/>The answers you are looking for may be found in why Call of Cthulhu players love the roller-coaster and some modern D&amp;D players only tolerate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

So you don't get methodical characters unless the GM requests them.<br/><br/>Let's say the GM <i>does</i> request them, because he wants to run a Call of Cthulhu game with a clue under every desk and a neat flavor bit in every drawer.  That's one of the two requirements for methodical play -- that it yields actual discoveries that are interesting to the GM*.  The other requirement is that the players are interested in what the GM's interested in!  This is what buying into WTGMW gets you.  If you weren't interested in that stuff, you wouldn't be playing this game.<br/><br/>So that's the good example.<br/><br/>The bad example is the haunted mansion with 20 rooms and 200 drawers, filled with 5 core clues and 195 bits of flavorful trivia, combined with a GM who refuses to advertise the 5 vs the 195, and bunch of players who think their purpose at the table is to piece together the core clues.<br/><br/>* By this I mean "actually excited to play with, interactively", as opposed to just "I like the sounds of the paragraph I just read aloud".  Alas, CoC flavorful trivia is often the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308036/#Comment_308036" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T11:52:09+00:00" title="January 13, 2011 11:52AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I see what you're getting at.

If the GM sees a player get psyched about something, he tries to bring more of that.  Likewise, in WTGMW play, the players should be paying attention to see what material the GM's excited about.  To support this, all the GM needs to do is support his own enthusiasm and not be "impartial" or OCD on room descriptions or whatever.<br/><br/>I know this can work for one player at a time.

This is meant to work together with the map of the current location (a city or a country), too support the players in contributing to the fiction in more informed ways.

Rather I'm trying to say: "This is the sphere of your characters", and then the game hands over the working-tools by which the players dive into the characters and their world. <br/><br/>The idea indeed is to present <i>a complete setting</i>, but in a way that makes it an inspiring framework for the fiction, and with a set of tools to support a vibrant <i>interaction</i>.<br/><br/>Creativity blossoms within restrictions, you know ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308177/#Comment_308177" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T09:20:57+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  9:20AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I dunno.

with how Character, protagonism, etc--the whole passionate character fightinf adversity thing--is at the heart of great stories. It may be a challenge to get the same result without focusing on Character as the building-block of Story.<br/><br/>Flagging character desires and passions, for instance, is a strong story-driver. Flagging, say, elements of the setting, or certain plot points, and then having all the main characters turn in that direction... may or may not work. I don't know for sure, but I feel there might be something there that's important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308338/#Comment_308338" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T23:47:52+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 11:47PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you guys are explaining why you like what you like, and noting that my nutty GM-based idea isn't that.<br/><br/>I don't know how far apart our tastes really are.

Fanmail could be a fine place to start if we can establish what you'd spend it on.  Probably <i>not</i> character success at tasks.  Maybe character relevance in the world?  Spend 5 fanmail to establish that one of the GM's major players has taken a special interest in you?<br/><br/>The other thing we'd need to decide is how the player characters interrelate.  In <i>Illuminatus!</i>, the reader gets to see the conspiracies unfold from multiple unrelated perspectives.  So the characters might not even know each other.  For that to work, though, the characters' scenes really need to make a big difference to each other.  That sounds hard.  Or, well, I guess it depends on the GM's plot.<br/><br/>What was the plot of your M&amp;M game again?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308444/#Comment_308444" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T12:52:27+00:00" title="January 16, 2011 12:52PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the M&amp;M game... there was a lot of business. The people with "weird" powers were very rare, and unknown to the majority of the population. There were three opposition groups dealing with the superhero/mutant issue, one that believed they should rule over ordinary humans (a kind of "bad guy" conspiracy), one which governed super/mutant society in a way to keep it separate from human society (a fairly benign organization), and then a government-run Men In Black type organization which believed they should all be locked or thrown in asylums.<br/><br/>There was also some time travel thing, where the heroes (a group of these weird-powers people) inadvertently release everyone from a prison designed to hold people with weird powers (a secret government thing). Then they have to go back in time to fix the problem, but I guess one prisoner still manages to escape, and gives birth to some weird cult trying to revive a millenia-old evil spirit/God/whatever. They unravel the conspiracy, discover secrets about their own past, and eventually confront this evil Thing and its cult in a final showdown.<br/><br/>So, there were a lot of things to play with and explore, but you can also see that this kind of plot is fairly rigid (I'm guessing the GM, while being completely open to *how* things would go down, pretty much planned the whole thing from the beginning). The actual playstyle, as I told you, was very "sandbox", with (from the player side) it seeming like we could go anywhere and do anything. There was a lot (A LOT) of discussion about how various plans would be carried out, but everything I ever saw the characters attempt was successful, except when they went up against the Big Bad without a plan for its defeat (or possible too early plotwise, who knows).<br/><br/>As for the "trying it" thing, let's start by imagining a prototype! And then we can design a little demo, maybe, to do over Skype or whenever we meet next (I think I missed the deadline for Dreamation, but if so I will be planning a trip to New York sometime in the next 4-5 months).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13605/give-the-gm-what-they-want" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13605/give-the-gm-what-they-want" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13605/give-the-gm-what-they-want/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13605%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13605%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
