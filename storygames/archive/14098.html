I got to play Fiasco a couple of times in the last month with different facilitators and had a great time. Hot to make my own playset after another couple of sessions.<br/><br/>Right now, though, I'm interested specifically in the gender and sexual politics of playing the game, and this forum seems to have a high population of people who've played Fiasco. So I'd appreciate hearing the experiences of people who've played the game enough times to have experienced different mixes of female and male players <i>and</i> characters: all-woman play groups; all-male play-groups; all-female casts; all-male casts; especially mixed groups and casts in different proportion?<br/><br/>What have been the gender mixes of your play groups? Of your casts? In your experience, did play change between, say, the time you played with only women vs the time you played with three women and a man? Or all men as players vs three men and a woman? Have you seen a lot of cross-gender play, and more or less as a play-group becomes more evenly mixed, gender-wise? Have you seen less or more sexual-preference and sexual-identity diversity in Fiasco sessions as opposed to other games you've played?<br/><br/>I realize no one player or group has a definitive "gender-politics in Fiasco is this" answer. That's why I'm really interested in a bunch of personal experience. Also, not interested, in this thread, in whether these are worthy questions to be asking. Interested in the plural of <i>anecdote!</i> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319012/#Comment_319012" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T05:50:09+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  5:50AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2011 8:10AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jim, some observations without analysis:<br/><br/>I've played a lot and in a variety of configurations. In convention play it is rare for me to facilitate a table without at least one woman at it. My local group plays Fiasco quite a bit and is all male. I've never played a session where there were more women than men, although I've played with parity at the table. In terms of table dynamics I've never seen much difference and I try to set the same ground rules regarding lines and veils regardless.<br/><br/>Gender swapping in character roles is very common regardless of player gender or sex. Many relationship choices in the Setup seem to encourage or inspire this. I'd say having one player at the table play the opposite gender is typical. New players typically avoid this. I think it is more common for men to play women than for women to play men.<br/><br/>One common, common trope that occurs in Fiasco sessions is the closeted gay dude, or the illicit homosexual affair. Sex in general - wanting it, getting it, regretting it - is obviously a huge part of most sessions. You can watch people vote with their dice to shape the outcomes based on how various themes are portrayed, which is fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319027/#Comment_319027" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T06:58:52+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  6:58AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason pretty much sums up my experience as well.

I've not noticed any differences in play that can be attributed to gender composition, since the players have varied so much from session to session.<br/><br/>Three of the six games involved a homosexual character and/or relationship, all of which involved at least one player who was gay.  It would be eays to say that having gay players led to more gay characters or relationships, but it does seem like straight players go to that well more often in Fiasco than in other games.

The other one also quit talking to me, but only later (also, in theory, not because of Fiasco).  There is some part of me that feels like playing Fiasco with only one girl in the game might lead to that girl never talking to you (or maybe just me) ever again.  This is not true, of course, but we tend to learn from the repetition of events.<br/><br/>Also, both times i've played, the group came to the conclusion that it felt right to 'cast' our characters based on Cohen brothers recurring stars.  There's been a William H. Macey, a John Goodman, a Tilda Swinton, and a Frances McDormand every time. (that's two times)  Not sure how that affects gender-whatnots.

We like to make things as difficult (read: tangled) as possible.<br/>The last play I can remember involved me being a 65 year old lesbian mob boss named Dutchy, who was having an affair with the Sheriff's wife (wife played by a male), with whom almost everyone at the table was in love with, even though she was a raging drunk who had secretly killed a few people.<br/>Another one play involved at least two different love triangles involving every sexual/gender combination you could probably imagine, but what else is there to do in Antarctica?<br/><br/>I don't know if this is the case for everyone, but we've used Fiasco a lot to introduce non-gamers to RPGs (males and females both) because its pretty quick to pick up, and if you say "Think Cohen Bro movie" everyone gets it. So I know we've gotten a few women into playing specifically Fiasco, even if they aren't super interested in learning other systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319167/#Comment_319167" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T14:27:41+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  2:27PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played with mostly only dudes, but with a a mix of characters pretty close to 50/50, gender-wise.<br/><br/>In my experience, one-shots lend themselves to greater freedom in playing cross-gender characters than campaign games, and Fiasco is super-great for one-shots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Supplanter" title="Supplanter"><img alt="Supplanter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Supplanter">Supplanter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319201/#Comment_319201" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-06T16:01:29+00:00" title="April  6, 2011  4:01PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone: thanks.

More or less diversity of sexual preference and gender identification? And anything I've forgotten to ask about your experience of gender and sex, at the table and within the fiction, in FIasco vs. Not Fiasco.<br/><br/>Some folks have already gone in this direction, which is great.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20Granade" title="Stephen Granade"><img alt="Stephen Granade" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8087/tinygranade.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20Granade">Stephen Granade</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319635/#Comment_319635" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T11:32:51+00:00" title="April  8, 2011 11:32AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Fiasco plays have all been with both women and men, usually 2:3 or 3:2. Possibly because of that we haven't done a lot of gender swapping. None of the people I've played with are homosexual, but several times we've have a closeted gay man, sometimes because of how the character evolved in play, and one time because we had two male players and the setup strongly indicated that they were both in the same college fraternity and in a sexual relationship. As Jason said above, I think it's because there's a whole lot of terrible potential inherent in a character with a deep secret they want to keep secret, and sexual secrets provide an extra jolt to that. (It also doesn't hurt that, since we're in the South, all of us have known people who were closeted and felt like they had to be.)<br/><br/>This is with various subsets of my local gaming groups, which are also a mix of men and women. We've also got several budding writers in there, and Fiasco scratches a similar itch for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_319756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319756/#Comment_319756" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-08T22:37:33+00:00" title="April  8, 2011 10:37PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2011 10:38PM by Jim_Crocker.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My general experience has been that it's a game that it's easier to interest female gamers in than many others, due in part to the modern setting and I think there's also a certain liberation in stating up front that things are very likely to go badly for the PCs, so that immediately lets up the pressure to play tactically or worry about somehow letting down the 'party.<br/><br/>The nature of the various playsets certainly helps to drive some of the gender and orientation choices players are likely to make, with some making more sense than others.<br/><br/>Lemme see if I can remember the times I've played:<br/><br/>My first game, where I was introduced, was the 'Nice Southern Town' playset: 5 players, 5 males, all played straight male PCs, it was a pretty straightforward 'Simple Plan' type setup.<br/><br/>Facilitated 3 games of it at GenCon last year: <br/>Operation Zebra, 3M 1F, with all of us playing straight male PCs.<br/>Las Vegas, 4M, 2 of us played females (including me), with a seriously NC-17 incestuous brother-sister incest thing going on.<br/>Gangster London, 3M 1 F, all played on-gender, though I was a gay fancy-lad gangster type.<br/><br/>At the shop a few months later, we played another Gangster London that was weirdly academic, set at Oxford: 2M, 2F, the women played on-gender, my one M friend who never passes up a chance to play a lesbian did so (there was a drug-fueled lesbian triangle to contend with), I played a crooked MP who committed suicide by jumping off the Tower of London.<br/> <br/>Facilitated a double-session for customers at the store: <br/>Last Frontier, with 3F 1M, all played on-gender<br/>Gangster London again, 2F 2M, One of the women played the older man who ran the Tandoori restaurant, otherwise on-gender, with one of the Ms stalking the other who wasn't really interested.<br/><br/>Got in a game at GTS: Lucky Strike, 5M, all played on-gender, though one of them was Ken Hite, which makes that game an outlier (in a good way) in more ways than one.<br/><br/>And just last week, Rock Band, with 2M 3F, all playing on-gender, with 2 of the women engaged in a groupie/singer tryst, and my PC male in the sense he was a post-op transsexual rock star who was actually twins with one of the other (female) PCs.<br/><br/>Clearly, you need more data points, which leaves me with no choice but to play more.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean" title="rian_bean"><img alt="rian_bean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/311/nCMERNOS5J27N.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean">rian_bean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319867/#Comment_319867" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T01:00:57+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  1:00AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We just played again tonight.

The lines of sexuality are almost always fluid, including homosexuality, bisexuality, and in one game an awkward case of incest. For the record, I'm totally not incestuous. Does the trend of sexual fluidity correlate with my own bisexuality? Maybe... Or maybe I tend to associate with a pretty open-minded lot. <br/><br/>It is the same in 99% of the games I play. I could speculate that indie games in general have more appeal to certain subcultures, and in particular those which either involve or brush shoulders with those that blur the lines of sexuality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Supplanter" title="Supplanter"><img alt="Supplanter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Supplanter">Supplanter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319934/#Comment_319934" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T17:28:18+00:00" title="April 10, 2011  5:28PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/rian">@rian</a>: Thanks!

I didn't say much about my motives for starting the thread because I didn't want to prejudice the discussion. I was kind of doing a Privilege-check on myself.<br/><br/>My first Fiasco session was at a<i> Taste of . . .</i> event at Labyrinth Games DC, where Jason attended and was a great co-host (along with the top-notch store staff). My table used the <i>Los Angeles 1936</i> playset. I played the trans ex-husband of the PC of the woman to my right, who was conning and being conned by the PC of the man to my left. It was a really good session! One of the things I have loved about playing Fiasco is that, while the elevator pitch is all "big ambitions and poor impulse control" and on the surface the setup and rules can look like they foster a war of all against all, the hallmark of actual play for me has been episodes of emergent sweetness - loyalty, generosity and self-sacrifice. So during the story, we have a scene where my ex-wife gives my PC her share of the loot because my PC needs the money for the final step in her gender reassignment; then my PC turns herself in to keep her ex-wife out of jail. Then my ex-wife got a "jackpot" epilog, while my character was last seen in a prison for criminals of a gender she no longer identifies with, trying to use stolen shoe polish as eyeliner. But my ex-wife also narrates how she visits me in prison regularly. (I was pleased to learn, post-game, that MTF gender-reassignment surgery dated from 1931, so our setup wasn't even anachronistic.)<br/><br/>The second time I played was at SynDCon in April. This was an all-guy table using <i>Flyover</i>, and we came out of setup with an all-male main cast of five. The two players clockwise from me played Latino immigrants to the midwest; the two widdershins of me played white burghers who were also the town meth lords. The player on my immediate right and I were old friends with a secret. We decided we were ex-white-supremacists who had committed a fairly major crime - probably involving someone's death - that we'd successfully kept secret. He was now a town councilman (and meth dealer). I was now a doctor running a clinic for low-income, mostly immigrant patients to make up for it. The guy to my left was an immigrant orderly at my clinic. Our connection was Weird Romance. The other player was open to playing gay characters, but I don't consider gay relationships or interracial relationships to be "weird," so we needed an extra twist. We decided that my character was repressed and closeted, and could really only <i>do it</i> by pretending to be dead. Fortunately the clinic had all these stretchers around. (As you might imagine, this session featured a lot of "Some Time Laters!" )<br/><br/>In the endgame my PC got hosed (surprise!), so after rolling over on his friend the meth dealer, stories surfaced of his old white-supremacist days and his relationship with the orderly came out too. His final denouement scene was being beaten nearly to death by Latino vigilantes while his clinic burned to the ground behind him.<br/><br/>Now, I don't think my PCs were, in context, more ridiculous or pathetic than any of the others. It would not only have been an offense against justice to play them as purely figures of ridicule, but it would have dishonored some real people who are very important to me. To me, each character was noteworthy for having bedrock principles and loyalties beyond their petty ambitions and slippery self-justifications. I liked them both very much as they developed in play.<br/><br/>BUT. I had to wonder - how much of this was <i>indulgence</i> on my part? I'm straight, cis-gendered, middle-aged, gainfully employed (knock wood) and so white I have to put on sunscreen if I want to catch fireflies without burning. Was my willingness to play these characters conditioned on: the one-shot nature of Fiasco; the absurdity of the genre; the fact that characters tend to come to undignified ends? It sounds like my play experience is pretty typical. I don't think that necessarily clears me of all possible charges , but it was interesting to learn.<br/><br/>Thanks again.<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323403/#Comment_323403" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T11:33:32+00:00" title="May  7, 2011 11:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a great game of fiasco: in a southern town (our first except for Ben Robbins), 3 women 2 guys, at least half of the group was queer.
