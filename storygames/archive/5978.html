Because in my business I deal mostly with d20 and other traditional games, my mind is always looking for ways to bring elements of narrative to the mechanics, if only to enhance the experience I'm getting with that game, and also because I would like to address a perceived hole in the design.<br/><br/>Example: playing my current D&amp;D play-by-email game, we have been for the past few weeks in a purely narrative situation, mainly dealing with my character. We haven't fought anything, bashed anything, bypassed anything, done anything of the typical things that garner you experience in D&amp;D - just talk and move the story forward (in a very satisfying manner, I should add). But it suddenly became obvious that we had not advanced at all in a period of time where before we had gained about a level, or at least a good amount of XP. The reason is that, as I said, we were not doing any of the things the game rewards you for, and although I know my DM is awarding XP for story encounters (let's call them that), he's house-ruling it because the game doesn't give him the tools.<br/><br/>I've been talking to him about SotC (IMO, the perfect gateway drug) and about Aspects, because I know he would like something to support story development mechanically. I also told him about Beliefs in BW as another example. So I thought, maybe I should just bring that mechanic into d20 already and then we'll have something concrete to handle periods like this one, where we're just talking and developing the campaign's story. I decided to use Aspects because they're already OGL and because I think I can translate the mechanics to d20 without much fuss. I also wrote a similar system for Witch Hunter called Convictions, an adaptation of Beliefs, and now that my friend and I have been working on new 4C/FASERIP material, I also sketched a way to bring in Aspects into that game as well.<br/><br/>My question is, does bringing in this type of mechanic really helps the game be more narrative-focused, or am I just messing with what X game is supposed to do?<br/><br/>I understand this mechanic is not the be-all/end-all of what makes a game more narrative focused, but from what I have seen, it goes a long way towards turning a bunch of numbers on a page into an actual character, and a vague and ephemeral backstory into something with concrete relevance to the game at hand.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133584/#Comment_133584" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T13:01:28+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  1:01PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2008 1:02PM by Ogremarco.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Daniel, I did the same kind of thing with GURPS.

I don't mean to turn D&amp;D into Polaris (to go to an extreme) but I would like D&amp;D to have a mechanic that supports and rewards, in the game &amp; in the rules, story development, the same way it supports and rewards killing monsters and taking their loot.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I am interested in whether a game is good, not what someone calls it.</blockquote>\nIt really isn't about the term I use to describe them, but about the type of play described by that term for the sake of simplicity.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>It depends in what way you bring the mechanic into the game.</blockquote>\nIn my Witch Hunter game, since I'm the GM, I made it a part right from character creation, except I didn't have the concept fully baked so they know about it but we haven't used it in-game yet. As soon as we're done with our first adventure, Convictions will be enabled and brought in full-force. We'll see how that goes.<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D game I am a player, so I need to send the idea to the DM to see what he thinks, then we can bring it to the other players so we can decide as a group if we want to use them or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133615/#Comment_133615" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T15:00:40+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  3:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think explaing your aims to the players is really important too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133618/#Comment_133618" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T15:55:06+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  3:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story Games = (no real definition yet)<br/><br/>Roleplaying Games = that subset of Story Games wherein the mechanics, permissions, and expectations are derived in some part from skirmish wargaming<br/><br/>So no, it doesn't become a Story Game, because it already was one.

I can have a story-focused game simply by playing pretend with my nephews, so it's not the fact that I am not getting a narrative-oriented game.

Yes, I totally am trying to do that, or was. Inherently I don't think there's a problem with bringing in that one mechanic and dropping it onto d20's lap; the whole system is made of bits like that all thrown together. But I want to make sure there's no issue with my fellow players. My DM is receptive enough to take a look and consider it if it doesn't disrupt the regular gameplay we have going, which is why because the last thing I want to do is break up the great game we have been playing so far.<br/><br/>Thanks for point that post to me, it gave me pause to think and figure out the correct way of approaching this to the benefit of the entire game group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134096/#Comment_134096" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T13:21:13+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  1:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately, discussion of such subjects are minefields.

Think of it this way: even standard D&amp;D has a narrative. It's mostly about strength and combat abilities and weapons and spells and such. Exchanging those things for beliefs and motivations doesn't give it any more or less of a narrative, it just changes what the narrative is about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see narrative mechanics as ones that shape the building of drama. For example, I see hit points as being a narrative mechanic. When they are lost, tension increases, and tension decreases as they are healed or recovered. Adventures push characters closer and closer to 0 hit points as the story progresses, with the climactic confrontation pushing them as close as the gamemaster dares. A narrative mechanic need not even relate to anything on a character sheet. Generally, these mechanics work over time, rather than at a particular moment like action resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134555/#Comment_134555" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T06:49:05+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  6:49AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been doing a lot of work in the last year to make my d20 games more collaborative and story-gamish.  I've bolted on various story game systems, tossed ones that didn't work well, put new ones on (with my players triedly saying, "Let's humor the poor boy." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>What I've found is that you get a sort of "split personality" game, where the roleplay and the combat run like separate systems.  That's not a bad thing, really, since 3.5E doesn't really have a "roleplay system" like it has a combat system.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it's not so much the systems you tack on as the attitude you and your players bring to the table.  But some systems can reinforce story game play at the table.<br/><br/>My latest campaign is set in Monte Cook's Ptolus setting, which is a HUGE city with lots of story hooks.  From the very beginning, I went through the book and found story hooks for the various PCs.  "Hey, do you want your character to be part of this organization?" "Here, your character can carry around this obviously magical key.  You don't know what it does, but maybe you can find out in the city."  From the start, the players were involved in hunting down clues regarding the mysteries I presented to them.  I encouraged this whenever I could by placing encounters that tied in with their stories, giving them a sense of progress.  And they've brought more and more narrative play into the game as a result.<br/><br/>Here are the various rules I've lifted from story games.<br/><br/>From Dogs in the Vineyard, I took the  "Either roll dice or say yes to the players."  It's amusing to see the look on players' faces when they ask, "Can I play a full-blooded orc who's trained as an elven duskblade and is the reincarnation of a servant of an ancient evil?" and you say yes.  (That player is now trying to find a path to redemption after he sacrificed another PC's girlfriend for power and released a demon god.)<br/><br/>From Primetime Adventures, I took the idea of "Fan Mail."  They players can now give each other poker chips at the table whenever another player does something "cool."  The chips can later be "cashed in" to get an extra 1d6 to a d20 roll.  It acts as positive reinforcement, as they keep trying to do cool things in order to earn the chips.<br/><br/>I'm now playing around with a formal system of beliefs/aspects, but these are already in the game a bit, as the players personal goals are really what's driving the story.<br/><br/>So I don't really think it's the rules that makes something a story game... but they can create an incentive for players to act that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134559/#Comment_134559" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T07:07:24+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  7:07AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think someone else mentioned that many reward systems are hidden. In particular, I'm thinking of those systems that give the player more power to affect the fiction that everyone shares. In D&amp;D3+ a great amount of the rules focuses on combat and this gives players a big, elaborate, and effective tool for affecting the shared fiction. As a results this is the where most D&amp;D3+ players spend most of their effort.<br/><br/>In games designed to treat all conflict the same, like PrimeTime Advantures, the players have no particular investment in playing out combat and tactics over drama and persuasion. <br/><br/>Also I wold point to Sprit of the Century's FATE points. While these can be earned as compensation for having your character act out counter to tactics or other good sense, they are also the device which powers the player's ability to activate Aspects and contribute more to the game. <br/><br/>There's a wider mechanic here than just carrots offered for desired behavior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134567/#Comment_134567" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T07:51:15+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  7:51AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll ditto all the "what's a story game/already a story game" stuff, but I will say this:<br/><br/>I don't think it makes a game into SotC/fate, because these things tend to be modifiers in games where they are houseruled in or even borrowed in printed form (e.g., Thousand Suns), whereas in SotC, they are almost the backbone of the game.<br/><br/>But that's alright. In SotC, I think Aspects do double duty in eliciting story and replacing more rigidly defined mechanics. If you already have mechanics for many things you would do with aspects in your game, then they don't need to do that double duty. But they can still help add a bit more dynamic feel to a game.<br/><br/>Here's something to try: if you have a game that already has a "player invoked modifier" mechanic like action points/action dice/etc., instead of importing the new mechanic of aspects and fate points, just wrap the existing mechanic in the aspect requirement. All you are really adding is context for invoking the existing mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135038/#Comment_135038" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T08:30:13+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  8:30AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've used BW's "Let it Ride" mechanic in D&amp;D...sort of. A player handed me a note with his character's Hide, Move Silently, Spot, and Listen check results on it. He had declared earlier that he was scouting around the outskirts of the village the group was currently visiting. Well there was nothing out there for him to hide from or discover, so I let those results ride until he actually would have needed to roll them. Several encounters later he was sneaking through an populated, underground city and he got to use all those check results for the entirety of that encounter - which was awesome because he had rolled very well and his successful scouting changed the course of the game.<br/><br/>Another technique I think would work well - settings stakes and narrating results on social skills like Diplomacy. From my experience, there's a few normal modes of play in D20 in a political situation:<br/><br/>1) Do the roleplaying and then role the dice, perhaps with "good RP" bonuses, to determine what reaction the NPC has.<br/>2) Just roleplay it out. This might include the characters acting in accordance with their Diplomacy skill level and the GM acting in accordance with the difficulty of the encounter/request and the opposed skills of the NPC.<br/>3) Don't roleplay the encounter (much), just roll dice.<br/><br/>Well in a lot of Story Games you would roll the dice (or flip the cards) in the middle of the roleplaying when you reach the conflict but before you act it out. I think this technique could be easily ported to traditional RPGs. In the D20 political/diplomacy example above you would set stakes then roll the player's Diplomacy (perhaps with assist modifiers, etc) against the DC or the opposed NPC's skill. After everyone knows the result (i.e. who must fail and who will get what they want) roleplay the rest of the encounter in accordance with those results. You could even award narrative control to the party that lost or by some other mechanic, but it's probably not necessary.<br/><br/>Now this would probably take a GM or player who is already skilled at stakes setting to teach those skills to the group. But since it would just be a change to the social mechanics and not the combat mechanics it might be a good stepping stone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
