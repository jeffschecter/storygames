The basic premise is that the Earth is beyond hope and humanity (for reasons that each group will establish in-play) has decided to leave the planet for orbital stations to terraform it. The players will be those left behind. I want the game to play across three Phases, each Phase representing a different stage of the process. Abandonment (we've been lift behind, oh crap what do we do), Regenesis (the machine and bio-goo are coming, how do we survive?), and Homecoming (invaders from the sky! We must protect our home). The playbooks will evolve across each Phase. The Doctor becomes the Patcher becomes the Medicine Man.<br/><br/>Here's my current issue (now that the intro is done). I want to come up with new stats to use. Hot, Cool, Sharp, Hard, and Weird are great, but they're definitely AW stats. I want to have 4-5 stats that reflect the setting I outlined above and function to describe the characters like the AW stats. I've been thinking of using these:<br/><br/>Controlled, Wild, Connected, Removed, and Mournful. I'm worried about how I've got them set up like dichotomies right now. Having a high Hot doesn't mean you're not also Cool. Controlled and Wild seem to be too opposite of one another, though. Wild and Mournful are nice and punchy, but the others seem to be lacking something.<br/><br/>Do you have any thoughts on this? If you need more clarification on something, please feel free to ask. I'm just starting this process.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400316/#Comment_400316" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T07:24:05+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  7:24AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 7:29AM by Krippler.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see how a person could not be both wild and controlled at the same time if they have more than one mode of operation! As with Fading Suns' extroverted/introverted a person could be better than another at both introverted <i>and </i>extroverted activities.<br/><br/>What is the time frame of the phases? I have a hard time seeing a Doctor become a Medicine man but I could totally see that happening within a few generations (if Medicine man is an adaption to different resources and problems). What I think would be super cool would be for the players themselves to set the pace for the evolution of the classes, perhaps the Doctor have the Angel style healing of using up resources to roll better but when resources are getting too scarce switching to Medicine man might be better because his moves would be powered differently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy" title="TheOtherTracy"><img alt="TheOtherTracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/711/nUY8JIY0C5ZHL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">TheOtherTracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400318/#Comment_400318" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T07:41:18+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  7:41AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the opposites aren't working for me.

Still, Controlled -&gt; Gray, Wild -&gt; Red, Connected -&gt; Green, Removed -&gt; White, Mournful -&gt; Black is intriguing.<br/><br/>For the Phases, my thought was that two generations (or more) would pass between each phase. That leaves time for both the tarraforming to happen, and for the playbooks to decay into one another. The moves would reflect the differing resources and mindsets, though there would be thematic similarities between each playset "lineage."<br/><br/>It's also possible that a group might want to play one particular phase, so I plan on each playbook having enough structure to allow that.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400399/#Comment_400399" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T20:00:40+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  8:00PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you decided what the basic moves are yet?

One way you might approach this is to ask yourself, what genre are you going for, and what fictional characters can you see the PCs emulating? And then asking, what makes these specific people interesting in this genre?<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, the characters are getting into tense situations, defying death, seizing things by force, manipulating each other, and so on. They succeed at these things because they're cool as ice cold, they're hard like boiled leather, they're hot as hell, they're just that much sharper than the other guy, or because they're just straight up unhinged bat shit nuts weird. To rephrase <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T%27s">@Paul_T's</a> point just a little bit, the moves in AW are all about what the characters do, but the stats are all about what the characters are, what specifically makes them so bad of ass.<br/><br/>So, what you might do is, yeah, do what <a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> said: decide on the basic moves. What do the characters do in this game? Like, what are the things they're all generally going to want to be able to try? And then, for each move, say to yourself, what makes a person ready, willing, and able to actually pull this off? What personal characteristics are conducive to it? For example, in AW, all of the characters are going to be in situations where it's tempting to try to seize something by force, but the ones who are going to be most good at it (and therefore most inclined to it) are the ones who are HARD, the ones with hearts of boiled leather and brains like a muscle taut and ready to pounce. And everyone's going to want to get neck deep in the psychic maelstrom but the ones who are not going to get swept away are the skin-crawling freak job "We Have Always Lived In The Castle" creeps who make their home there.<br/><br/>Anyway, the point is, the thing that makes AW so baller is the harmony between genre and what appears on the character sheet: genre is the most important (or at least the most abstract and "general") consideration, followed by who the characters are and what they do, followed by the specific personal characteristics that make them so bad ass in this genre. You could do worse than to approach your problem from this angle, I think! Hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400420/#Comment_400420" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T23:28:05+00:00" title="December 10, 2012 11:28PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2012 11:28PM by J_Walton.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Johnstone said.

I've gotten the same advice from another source, and it helped me to realize that I've been going about this ass-backward. My primary gaming background is D&amp;D, so I've got this stat-centric mindset that is the opposite of how AW functions.<br/><br/>Something that has been revealed in my pondering and discussing is that TerrorForm has a lot of strong family themes. People are grouping together after everyone else leaves Earth, and you all have to survive. What binds you together? What keeps those bonds from breaking? After a few generations have passed, what ties are still there, and what aren't? How have they changed, and how will they be affected by the coming terraforming? And after all of that, after you're an established people on your new, fresh Earth, how can you hold together when the invaders (your ancestors) come?<br/><br/>All of those questions seem to suggest some interesting moves to me, but I'm just nibbling at the edges of what they could be. Something like the base move being Protect What's Dear. Could be used for combat, defense. Just spitballing here.

I mean, in AW the stats convey quite a bit about the setting and its expectations, but they also affect the frequency with which the protagonists succeed at things they want to do. So they do double duty: they communicate why these heroes are bad asses, and they ensure that the heroes are bad asses more often than not.<br/><br/>An unmodified 2d6 gives you a hit 21/36 of the time, or 58.3%. It's a strong hit 6/36 of the time, or 16.7%. That means, even rolling +0, you're more likely than not to succeed to some extent, and your chance of attaining the best result is not negligible. For some genres, you might not necessarily WANT the characters to succeed more often than that. For example, if you were making a Gothic horror game, you might want bonuses to rolls to be few and far between, and to stem from the PC's actions (helping, getting situational modifiers and the like) rather than being inherent to them. This might be something you want try out, just as an experiment, to see if it feels right.<br/><br/>By contrast, a +1 modifier to 2d6 gives you a hit of any kind 25/36 of the time, or 69.4%. It's a strong hit 10/36 of the time, or 27.8%. That's a pretty considerable improvement. By the time you get to +2, you're getting a hit 30/36 of the time (83.3%), and fully half of those are strong hits. +3 means you're getting strong hits more often than any other result. That's fully appropriate for AW, and it's arguably appropriate for games like Dungeon World and Sagas of the Icelanders (because of the genres they're modelling), and even Monster Hearts (because of what the moves are for that game --- things that high school students in high school drama situations should be good at), but might not be right for all games, depending on the basic moves you have in mind.<br/><br/>In other words, you should think about whether you need permanent standing bonuses to the basic moves at all, based on your expectations of how often the characters should succeed at the things they do without immediate complications or fallout arising from their own actions. There might be other ways to convey the personal characteristics of the characters on the sheet, other than stats.<br/><br/>You might experiment with something like the following. In AW, each splat has one high ability score that makes them good at basic moves that use that score. Instead of doing that, you might make your splats so they say something like, "When you use [this or that basic move], roll three dice and keep the highest two to determine your result." Someone mentioned it in another thread as an option to replace flat bonuses. This is interesting because it does improve the odds of getting a hit, but it's biased toward soft hits. Now you have a hit 174/216 of the time, or 80.6%, and it's a strong hit 77/216 of the time, or 35.6%. That's almost as good as +2 in terms of getting a hit at all, but not quite as good in terms of getting strong hits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400523/#Comment_400523" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-11T19:26:02+00:00" title="December 11, 2012  7:26PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks, all.

It's definitely an interesting idea, and one I'll lay around with. Your observation that things being more deparate might mean that success is less likely is a good one. A potential downside that I see is that such low odds of a fantastic success might prevent the characters from acting (it's a meta-game concern). The fiction would have to motivate them, which I hope it would. The "roll three, pick two" strategy is also interesting. Good food for thought.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/jbinc">@jbinc</a> The moves will definitely be changing to reflect the technology and culture. Your example of the Doctor moves is a perfect one. Society is going to change across the generations. Each Phase will be a few generations removed from the one before it to give room for those changes to have occurred.<br/><br/>I also quite like the idea of experience being spent to establish what gets preserved in later generations. It's novel, inventive, and something really speaks to me about how the game would progress across the Phases. Thank you for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbinc" title="jbinc"><img alt="jbinc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/106/nFRMKD4VH4ILG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbinc">jbinc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400580/#Comment_400580" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T10:30:55+00:00" title="December 12, 2012 10:30AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">@TheOtherTracy</a> My pleasure - I'm psyched to read more! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400613/#Comment_400613" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T14:00:31+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  2:00PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My suggestion is to read and play as many hacks as you can, and pick some moves that do sorta what you want and hack them until you have a few core moves that cover most of the basics of play (this could be 1 move or 6 moves, but probably not more than 6-8, because that's too many to keep track of, unless you've broken them down into categories). Then you play the game and see which moves people actually use and if the moves work in play like you want them too.<br/><br/>I was working on a "Terrorform" thing for AW <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2010/10/26/dibs/" rel="nofollow">a while back</a>, but never ended up with something in a format that I liked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
