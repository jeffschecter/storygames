What I mean by <i>this</i> is a game system where the mechanics do not steer or direct play.  To the best of my understanding Nar facilitating game design employs various mechanics to steer, hold and reward play that focuses on the Premise Question.  Gamist facilitating game design holds the game to address of Challenge by primarily (only?) having mechanics that reward and focus on Challenge Situations.  I understand that these mechanics systems are not self enforcing and that any game design can be played in any CA.  That being said, the underlying assumption in both these CA's is that System is privileged over the SIS and thus helps direct play toward a desired CA of the game creator.  Unless I'm badly mistaken this shouldn't be a controversial proposition as has been argued for a long time now, "System Does Matter."<br/><br/>But what if, instead, Setting and thus Character and Situation were privileged and System was not?  What if the Mechanics were subordinate to (the on going creation of) the SIS?  This absolutely does not mean that anything can go, but rather that what is considered plausible is based ultimately and thus primarily upon the Setting.  This formulation holds that what types of characters that are "allowed" are based upon both the characters in the source material but the Setting as well.<br/><br/>I can see the standard arguments of why this can't happen but many of them can also be laid at the feet of dysfunctional G/N games.<br/><br/>DM deprotagonization of the players.<br/>How will the players know what to do?<br/>How will the players know what they can/can't do?<br/>The world/gameplay will be incoherent.<br/><br/>This can be the case, but it does not have to necessarily follow.  From what I've read on boards and seen played at conventions demonstrates that these problems arise no matter the game system or the CA.<br/><br/>So my question is can anyone see a way how this can work. (I know it can because I've spent the last 25 years playing in a game that's been running the past 40 years.)  I should note that in our particular iteration we do not have campaigns nor companies but we do have folios of characters and that the world and characters cultures do expand over time....as does the system.<br/><br/>I'd appreciate any thoughts on this from anyone but especially from designers.  Thank you in advance.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482193/#Comment_482193" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-20T22:32:14+00:00" title="April 20, 2019 10:32PM">April 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To the best of my understanding Nar facilitating game design employs various mechanics to steer...

Please ignore this if you don't actually care about the jargon; people sometimes couch simple questions in difficult language for no good reason, so I won't assume that this theory stuff is the point of your query.<br/><br/>The flaw in your formulation is that "System Does Matter" never meant what you say. If you'll read the original essay where Ron coined this pithy phrase, you'll see that it's a demagogic piece about the cult of the GM: an analysis of the idea that the GM's general GMing skills are what determines whether a roleplaying game is good or not. Ron's conclusion was that no, the GM is ultimately a functionary of the communal system of play, and therefore one should not ignore the game itself: the system you play with has major impact on the kind of game you get.<br/><br/>Later on the process of Forgite theory-crafting ended up messing a lot with the term "System", but the motto never quite became unglued, so it became a famous Forgite catchphrase. Still, it never meant anything even close to what you imply here: Forgite theory never concluded that System Matters because mechanical game rules are the One True Way to achieve creative priorities.<br/><br/>I'll try to distill a complex body of conclusions into a compact form: the reason for why System Matters is that "System" itself is the social infrastructure the players use to communicate and coordinate with each other; without it there is no game-play, and in fact no communication. The mechanical rules are merely the most superficial and explicit part of the whole system that the players engage when they play. The Lumpley Principle has pretty much become the accepted definition of "System" here: System is the means by which the group agrees upon what happens in the fiction.<br/><br/>This has direct implications for your question only in that while you phrase yourself as somehow overturning a theoretical understanding, I would rather say that you're merely exploring the possibilities. Yes, the System does not need to utilize a rulebook. It is well possible for the system to prioritize Setting over game mechanics, and in fact many games do exactly that.<br/><br/>But that's just abstract theory and jargon; let's look at the actual substantial question.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But what if, instead, Setting and thus Character and Situation were privileged and System was not?

Is it so in your part of the world? Around here there are many games that are played exactly like this. I would even say that most roleplaying games we play are like that.<br/><br/>There are of course many differences in how this creative ideal is achieved, exactly. Did you realize while formulating this question that the setting does not actually get a vote at the game table? Even if we pay lip-service to the idea that setting comes first, the game still needs to have some kind of a system for determining what the setting demands, case by case. The Game Master is often elevated as the primary judge and high priest in that regard.<br/><br/>The other common method is for the players to argue things over, perhaps voting in some way about their distinct understandings of the setting to find unity and move on. After all, this stuff is often far less than clear. Do houses in Safelster (a region of Glorantha) have glass windows? Who knows, and why?<br/><br/>If it seems surprising to you that I find this kind of creative priority to be common, consider this: our on-going D&amp;D campaign does not include the dragonborn race because it is not part of the campaign setting, despite the race existing in the rulebook. The GM (me) technically speaking decided on this while writing up the campaign prep, but it was sort of obvious: there aren't dragonborn or anything even remotely similar in the land of Prydain, so clip clip go the scissors on the Player's Handbook. Is this not an example of the Setting having primacy over whatever? Is this somehow uncommon, rather than the way people usually play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482247/#Comment_482247" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T14:40:03+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  2:40PM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But what if, instead, Setting and thus Character and Situation were privileged and System was not?

You may not like it, but this is what peak roleplay looks like.<br/><br/>In such a game, I think that primary resolution system would involve answer questions that prep work might not cover, otherwise you have questions like, "How much noise are the orcs in the next room making? Which way are they looking? Will they travel north or south in the next turn? What do they want to accomplish?" While prep work could answer that, it would quickly become cumbersome to try to do that for every scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482251/#Comment_482251" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T16:11:17+00:00" title="April 21, 2019  4:11PM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 12:54PM by lorenzogatti.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote"> What I mean by this is a game system where the mechanics do not steer or direct play.</blockquote>\nGame rules, by definition, "steer or direct" play; if they do not, they are not rules and they might as well not exist. <br/><br/>However, there are "soft" rules that suggest instead of prescribing and are hard to recognize as rules; examples of how the game is meant to be played are common, but sometimes there's something subtler and without explicit reference to game mechanics. <br/><br/>Is this special kind of rules that you are interested in? <br/><br/>For example, the essays about, respectively, Middle Eastern conflict and cold war espionage in <i>Shahida </i>and <i>Spione</i> by Ron Edwards, which are in both cases about ten times longer than the recognizable "rules", are an equally essential part of the game: they suggest spaces of characters, situations and events that players can draw from when they need to come up with something during play. <br/><br/>Another example: illustrations. <br/>Imagine an alternate history in which Matt Groening and John Kovalic illustrated the core AD&amp;D manuals, with the same scenes, page by page. And another alternate history in which, say, Keith Haring, Salvador Dal\xec and Francis Bacon took the job. <br/>Imagine all <i>Magic:the Gathering</i> cards with illustrations by Amy Weber, or all with illustrations by Phil and Kaja Foglio. They simply wouldn't be the same games.\n<blockquote class="Quote">But what if, instead, Setting and thus Character and Situation were privileged and System was not? </blockquote>\nI don't think this means what you think it means. Apart from the difference between dynamic situations that arise during play and static setting and characters, the "system" of the game (including proper "mechanics" and, as Eero recapitulated, the often more informal ways to participate and communicate) exists only to serve the situation, setting, characters, and other things that interest players and are part of a "creative agenda". <br/><br/>It's like asking if a restaurant should privilege food over furniture and kitchen tools: of course every restaurant privileges food, it's the whole point of a restaurant. <br/>Actual alternatives that allow discussion of what should be "privileged" in a restaurant are on one side about what food it should serve or how good it is, and on the other side about whether the knives are sharp and the lighting is comfortable or how I'm supposed to eat a lobster with a spoon.<br/><br/>Forgite discussion picked apart creative agendas (the food of the RPG restaurant) and secondarily paid a lot of attention to "system" and in particular to effective, purposeful rules, never questioning that systems and creative agendas are on different planes.<br/><br/>There's some place for genuine differences of ideology and taste, rather than mere lack of clarity and understanding, at the next level of the Forgite discussion: recognizing (and despising) the bad games that result from letting ill-considered systems (typically traditional or implicit ones) ruin the play experience, and advocating coherent design in which carefully designed (and carefully applied) rules hopefully determine good player social interactions and serve a specific range of creative agendas.<br/><br/>This attitude to design has produced a clear opposition between "small" and specialized games that result from coherent design efforts employing minimal and elegant rules and leaving as much as possible to improvisation during play to avoid burdening the GM with preparation, and big games that offer a large toolbox of options and preparation fodder to the players (enough to cause trouble with divergent creative agendas).<br/> <br/>It isn't the same as the difference between caring about some setting element (e.g. "a game about being a soldier attempting to survive winter and succession wars in George R.R. Martin's popular Westeros novels" or "a funny game about adorably weak goblins at the bottom of the social order") or caring about more abstract structures of story and events (e.g. "a game in which a player can make any character reliably survive, but not necessarily win, frequent combat against similarly powerful opponents thanks to prudence and good tactics" or "a game in which player characters die so easily that, somehow, it has to be fun and not a catastrophe").\n<ul>\n<li>Setting and structural elements influence each other, and no matter what's the starting point a game will probably have both. What setting is appropriate for a certain kind of story? What characters are going to appear in it? And conversely, what sort of things should happen to a certain type of characters in a certain setting, often enough to deserve rules?<br/>For example, the examples above form two obvious complementary pairs; the second one describes an existing game, <i>Goblin Quest</i>. Soldiers needs to survive war to allow a campaign with a span of many years, while goblins with any hope of durability wouldn't be sufficiently cute, downtrodden and expendable.</li>\n<li>It's hard to draw a line between a setting and more abstract themes and creative agendas. <br/>For example, traditional D&amp;D isn't simply a game with a high-fantasy setting and some peculiar traditional monsters, it's specifically about adventurers, and in particular adventurers who venture into dungeons, and more specifically about venturing into dungeons to kill monsters and steal their treasure, and more specifically about defeating monsters in combat, and more specifically about being successful at combat through mechanics like winning initiative, not getting hit, and dealing the maximum amount of hit points of damage in the shortest time. <br/>A ladder of design at different scales, from metaphysics that could apply to any kind of game to very specific rules.</li>\n<li>The same techniques of purposeful, coherent design apply equally to setting objectives and structural objectives and serving more purposes with the same rule is usually regarded as elegant and economical design.<br/>For example, character stats are both a foundation for further rules about conflict resolution etc. and a way to represent something that matters in the setting. <br/>In individual tough situations hit points offer a dial to make combat and injuries as lethal as considered appropriate, and on a broader level if characters have hit points they are going to have physical conflicts (not necessarily often).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482284/#Comment_482284" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T04:49:57+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  4:49AM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jay,<br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out how to engage with this topic, because I can tell you're not going to like the responses you've received so far. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Perhaps I can try to steer this in a different direction:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>But what if, instead [of System being "in charge" of creating fictional content], Setting and thus Character and Situation were privileged and System was not?

What criteria or techniques would help an observer to distinguish the playstyle you're describing from "heavily GM-led, freeform roleplaying"?<br/><br/>That might be a good start for getting at the topic you wish to discuss here.<br/><br/>And using some real examples might really help dig us out of the "Theory Swamp" and give some clarity to the discussion - otherwise, it's very hard to engage with what you're writing without starting to debate the details of the theory (like a couple of other posters, I don't agree with how you lay out those terms or use them).<br/><br/>As someone with now a fair bit of familiarity with your game, I think you have something really unusual to offer, and discussing it is quite fruitful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482289/#Comment_482289" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T07:23:09+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  7:23AM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2019 10:28AM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited April 22</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I'm being dense here, but isn't what the OP describes what Archipelago does?

This is your base chart, however.<br/></blockquote>\nNow, surrounding text and examples would give some advice about how to do that, but it really does come down to something that simple.<br/><br/><br/>More importantly, it's <b>not</b> based on dramatic need, or physics, or ( God help us) our presumed understanding of similar "real world" situations and how or setting/characters compare/contrast to those.<br/><br/>It's based on the likelihoods of the events occurring within the inspirational material ( <b>initially</b>), modified by our play precedents over time in our own particular session/campaign.<br/><br/>IOW, we started this game inspired by, say, my love of and understanding of 1980s Chris Claremont X-Men/ New Mutants comics. Early on, those comics provide the basis of what possible outcomes are paired with that chart. Over time, our collective interpretations, fiction, outcomes of earlier chart uses, and so on become the more predominant guide, although still influenced by the earlier inspirational material.<br/><br/>If we played for 30 years in that setting, starting from that basis, it is very possible that our outcomes don't actually match up with  current versions of those same characters+settings that initially inspired us.<br/><br/>To me, that would be privileging characters and setting over mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482299/#Comment_482299" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T13:43:55+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  1:43PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is pretty common in two different styles.<br/><br/>If players have authority to develop details about this setting, frame scenes, and drive play, then this sounds like a lot of freeform (a step away from Archipelago as others have noted).<br/><br/>If the GM has sole authority around setting details and scene framing (often from prep or published material) and the players are focused on exploring and surviving this setting, than this sounds like a lot of OSR play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482300/#Comment_482300" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T13:45:57+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  1:45PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen examples of the second evolving into the first over time, and unofficially.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482440/#Comment_482440" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T23:07:03+00:00" title="April 23, 2019 11:07PM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2019 7:58PM by Silmenume.">edited April 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a>, \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>This is the ideal RPG.

I think it veers very close to <i>One True Wayism</i>.  I do believe there is a specific CA where this is the case, one that I've been arguing for on and off for almost 15 years.  <br/><br/>Let me see if I can offer an example where a game that has been described as very fun to play and of <i>exceptional</i> design (the peak of roleplay?) but privileges mechanics over Setting.  This would be Dogs In The Vineyard and it is, of course, Narrativist facilitating.  I played it once and absolutely loved the Setting and Character concepts (in the general sense but not in the particulars) but the actual play process drove me bonkers.  Everytime I wanted to do something in the game following some event I wasn't either allowed to or I kept tripping over the conflict resolution system which to me felt very disconnected from the play I was seeking.  IOW it was terrible conflict of CA priorities.  My fault, not the game's. Anyway here's a quotes I lifted from the rules set as examples of my point.\n<blockquote> - a town welcomes you with celebration and honor, but what you\u2019re there to do is stir up its dirt and lay bare its sins.<br/><br/> - It\u2019s episodic. A town per session, a town per two sessions if it\u2019s a big deal town.<br/><br/> - In every town the characters visit, there\u2019s something wrong, and <i>their job is to figure out what it is and put it right. </i>Sometimes what\u2019s wrong is just a minor thing with the potential to become much, much worse; sometimes it\u2019s worse already. Either way <i>the characters <b>will</b> uproot it, judge it, and enact upon it the will of God.</i><br/><br/> - The game\u2019s rules\u2019 job is to help you, the GM, reveal the pride, sin and corruption in the towns you create, and <i>provoke the characters\u2019 judgment</i>. They work a) by helping you create congregations in turmoil, then b) <i>by seizing conflicts and relentlessly escalating them</i>, then c) by bringing the consequences back home to the players.</blockquote>\nThe game won some awards and mostly gets very good reviews.  IOW, generally speaking it is a very good game but system and mechanics (which I didn't list) are definitely privileged over Setting.  What if you wanted to run a scenario where the Dogs are between towns and are attacked by bandits or a bear?  What if they wanted/needed to go hunting?  What if the dogs ran into leading military forces of General Santa Anna heading west from Texas?  The conflict resolution mechanics are really drilled down to specific conflicts.  In the possible examples I listed above one would be extremely pressed to apply them to the Situation arising from the Setting elements I provided...<br/><br/>...and in all of this there is absolutely nothing explicitly "wrong" with the game design with its privileged mechanics.  In fact they are central to the real point of the game design - Addressing Premise with a vengeance!  Without the rules and mechanics being privileged over Setting it would be extraordinarily difficult to focus the game on Addressing the Premise Question.  Obviously the rules are not self enforcing but if one wants the excellent game experience that this game potentially offers then following the rules and employing the mechanics is rather necessary.  They are the tools provided for facilitating the Narrativist CA.<br/><br/>My point is that you can have excellent gameplay that does not prioritize Setting, but if you do want gameplay that prioritizes Setting then the G/N CA's are, by their very nature, not where one ought to be.  My point is that Setting prioritized play may not be the pinnacle of roleplay in general but I argue that there is another CA that does privilege Setting over mechanics/system.  This other CA is poorly understood and often dismissed out of hand but is of great interest to me and I'm fighting like hell for it.\n<blockquote>In such a game, I think that primary resolution system would involve answer questions that prep work might not cover, otherwise you have questions like, "How much noise are the orcs in the next room making? Which way are they looking? Will they travel north or south in the next turn? What do they want to accomplish?" While prep work could answer that, it would quickly become cumbersome to try to do that for every scenario.</blockquote>\nI could simply reply that highly granular detail is not required for such play.  For each of the questions you offered in the above all the GM would have to do is ask the player to roll a die (we usually use a D20) and make a determination based on the roll.  Higher is better, lower is worse and take into any extenuating circumstances.\n<blockquote> - How much noise are the orcs in the next room making?  If the group is trying to sneak by a higher number would indicate more noise to cover their movement or whatever action they are seeking to take.  Low would indicate little noise.  If the player is trying to make an estimate as to the number of Orc rolling vis sound High could be better if you are looking to engage because the number of Orc would be less.  If you are seeking a large war band then a High number result would result in lots of noise indicating that you've likely found the them.<br/><br/>- Which way are they looking? - Depends on what is advantageous to the party.  A high roll would mean mostly away while a low number means mostly at you.<br/><br/> - Will they travel north or south in the next turn? - In this case we'd roll to see if we could even determine such information.  If we rolled particularly well or particularly poor then we'd get information but good info on a high roll and bad info on a low roll.<br/><br/> - What do they want to accomplish? - That particular piece of information would be left to the player's actions to determine, if possible.  However if the gaggle is large and not just a small random encounter then this is something that the GM should give a little thought on prior to play.  In our game motivation of NPC is probably the most important piece of the NPC's profile (and this does include the motivation of a large sized group) that the GM considers this before play - unless the GM is really good at making this stuff up in the moment.  If a player comes up with a way that allows them the possibility to gain said intelligence then a roll might be called for.  Or if the idea is plain brilliant/clever enough then just give the info or call for a roll.</blockquote>\nNot so hard.  The best part is that each die roll can and usually increases the tension of the moment as a rolled '1' is usually pretty disastrous.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482441/#Comment_482441" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T23:42:36+00:00" title="April 23, 2019 11:42PM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2019 11:48PM by Jeph.">edited April 23</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I get what Jay means when he says "mechanics subordinate as opposed to directive," because I've spent a hell of a long time trying to grok how he and his group plays. For all that, I'm not great at describing it.<br/><br/>If anyone else is interested in taking the same journey, here's a rabbit-hole for you; just keep following the links at the tops of posts backwards...<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21103/the-spicy-dice-roll-salvaging-something-coherent/p1</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21862/when-the-die-roll-does-not-determine-what-happens/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21862/when-the-die-roll-does-not-determine-what-happens/p1</a><br/><br/>-<br/><br/>So. When I think of this sort of game, I think of a game that is indeed very much like structured freeform\u2014where much of the structure comes from a swiss-army knife of tools that the GM may apply, or ignore, or build upon, or re-interpret, at his leisure.<br/><br/>EDIT: And maybe a greater amount of structure comes from the group's shared conventions on "How we play RPGs," which, in this sort of group, are mostly taught by example and not explicitly discussed I think?<br/><br/>In the game Jay plays, the most common of these tools is:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Roll a d20:</b><small>The GM directs a player to roll a d20\u2014sometimes twice or thrice in a row\u2014often in the middle of a description of something, in the middle of a breath, even. The player announces the result, quickly. The GM keeps narrating, his narration maybe influenced by the roll, higher is better; and players will be very disappointed if this continued narration is not pointedly influenced by a natural 1 or natural 20.</small></li>\n</ul>\nIn my own games, when I run in this style, I have a few other similar tools in my swiss-army knife, most based loosely upon Jay's descriptions of how his GM does things:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Damage:</b><small> Players and NPCs have hit points. When I think a character should be injured, I tell a player to roll as little as 1 point or 1/2d6 or as many as 4d6 of damage, 6s exploding. Taking half your HP in a single blow is a major wound; total damage at least equal to HP is incapacitating, and more is (eventually) deadly. When I think a character should recover some, I tell a player how much damage is erased.</small></li>\n<li><b>Burden:</b><small> Players have Willpower, which is used for magic, which is language, authority, understanding, and perception. When they perform magical acts beyond communication, opening their senses, and mere requests, I might assign Burden, as little as 1 point or 1/2d6 or as many as 4d6, rolled open-ended like damage. The more audacious and unsubtle, the greater the exercise of will, the larger the scale, the more dice. When Burden from a single act exceeds half Willpower, a character is fatigued; burden accumulated over Willpower becomes magical backlash.</small></li>\n<li><b>Saving Throws:</b><small> I have players pre-calculate target numbers for saves against Trauma, Dread, Hesitation, and Fate. Whenever I like, I ask a player to roll a d20 against one of those target numbers. If they fail, I constrain what they can do; they're maybe rooted to the spot by fear, or too weak to do more than crawl, or too slow to react before their enemy acts. If they pass, I let them act mostly unhindered.</small></li>\n<li><b>Character Stats:</b><small> Players have a character sheet with 6 ability scores, proficiency levels in a bunch of skills, and a bunch of Wises and Trainings. Sometimes I'll ask things like, "What's your score in Might?" or "How's your Archery?" or "Do you have a relevant Wise?", and that will influence what I say next. Sometimes I'll reduce an ability score, from injury or magical backlash; or sometimes award a new skill at Proificient, or a new Training or Wise.</small></li>\n<li><b>Advancement Ticks:</b><small> We put little tick-marks next to abilities and skills. When you accumulate enough, your ability score or proficiency level goes up. Under some set circumstances, plus whenever I like, I award these ticks. When characters are putatively tied for some stat or skill, I might ask if a character has a half-rank, meaning, are you more than halfway to advancement?</small></li>\n</ul>\nNone of these are rules we have to use. But they're always an option, always something I can call upon to convey something about the world.<br/><br/>There's no rule like, "When a character sees something fearsome, they must Save versus Dread or be paralyzed by fear, or flee." Instead, when I think it's important to convey how fearsome something is, I might call for a Save versus Dread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482442/#Comment_482442" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-23T23:42:44+00:00" title="April 23, 2019 11:42PM">April 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> Hi Jay, I want to ask you directly this time.

(Jeph, I don't know if you've seen our most recent thread about Jay's game - I could dig it up if you missed it.)<br/><br/>That's why I asked, earlier, what differentiates it from GM-led freeform, or very very heavily Rule Zero-based play. Do you have an answer for me, Jay? (Or you, Jeph?)<br/><br/>It seems to me that most of those details (as so nicely described in Jeph's post) could be omitted or changed, without changing the core of gameplay at all. <br/><br/>If we rolled pools of d6s, and rolled them much less often, would it change the fundamental creative effort and reward of this game? I don't think so; at least not in any way I can manage.<br/><br/><i>It seems to me that the core System of play is basically unrelated to the details of the numbers, stats, and dice.</i><br/><br/>I'm always reminded of the "Six Word RPG", by Mark Hughes. Here's the entirety of the text (although I am typing from memory... so there could be errata):<br/><br/>"Describe character. Roll dice. GM decides."<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that <i>Archipelago</i> could provide a similar form of play in some ways, but it differs in a few important aspects:<br/><br/>* It's GMless (which may or may not be a really key factor here, given the primacy of the GM in this mode of play)<br/><br/>* The rules of the game *are* sacrosanct, not a tool in one player's toolkit, to be used or discarded as that player sees fit.<br/><br/>In this sense, it does not fulfill Jay's criteria of "mechanics subordinate to game play", although it easily could if we were a bit loose with them.<br/><br/>I'm kind of at a loss as to whether the "underlying System" of this style of freeform play is just as strict as any other game (the standard Forge answer), with things like dice mechanics used more or less as "spice", with no real formalism, at the whim of one player, or if the mechanical looseness is an actual feature which other games do not share (as Jay is suggesting).<br/><br/>My assumption is that it's the former, but I'm open to arguments otherwise.<br/><br/>So, Jeph and Jay: in what ways, if any, is this approach to play meaningfully distinct from any "Six Word RPG"-style GM-led freeform RPG activity?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482465/#Comment_482465" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-24T03:51:19+00:00" title="April 24, 2019  3:51AM">April 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2019 3:52AM by Jeph.">edited April 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, that's a good question Paul. And of course I can't really answer for Jay and his group, just from my own play that's been inspired by Jay's reports of his own group's play.<br/><br/>Tangent: The more I learn about Jay's group, the more I realize their actual play is fairly different from what I'd envisioned a year or two ago. I guess when you get right down to it we don't really 100% share priorities. And you could def have a group that shares the priority discussed in this thread\u2014system totally, entirely subservient to setting and the bricolage process, just another instrument in the semiotic jazz ensemble\u2014but completely lacks the powerful GM featured in Jay's play and (to a lesser extent) my own. For that group, Archipelago's mechanic might be just the thing.<br/><br/><b>In what ways is the "GM's Toolkit" I describe above different from "Describe character; Roll dice; GM decides"?</b><br/><br/>Bricolage!<br/><br/>It's a consistent core around which you can build up all kinds of cool cruft.<br/><br/>It's common ground that gets imbued with meaning through play.

I see the deor-wights tear through a party of characters with mostly Proficient and Advanced skill at arms, but my Swordsmanship, remember, is Surpassing! I know I'm a more skilled fighter and might have a chance.<br/><br/>It's a lens that helps us remember and interpret play. "And then I rolled two nat 20s in a row, and exploded three damage dice! He was dead in an instant!"<br/><br/>It's a material with which we can build, and a foundation that we can build upon. It lets me decide that, in the giant Nurwafir's presence, you save against Dread at half TN. It lets me decide that most blades shatter on a troll's skin, maybe dealing only a point or, on an exceptional result, 1/2d6 damage, but this magic blade deals a full die, and never chips.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482466/#Comment_482466" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-24T04:06:33+00:00" title="April 24, 2019  4:06AM">April 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2019 4:08AM by Paul_T.">edited April 24</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeph,<br/><br/>I share your fascination with the game and the process, and agree that the more I learn about it the more I am surprised by certain details.<br/><br/>However, I don\u2019t think that having a sort of \u201cinterlingua\u201d, as you describe it, is the defining feature here. You\u2019re right that it carries meaning in Jay\u2019s game, but the feature Jay is trying to talk about here is just as much about how non-binding it is.<br/><br/>I used to run Fudge this way, with abilities and scores and vague rules, but interpreting actual outcomes quite fluidly, as it best suited the story, simulation, or bricolage.*<br/><br/>The rules you\u2019re describing (e.g. about the sword chipping) would not be communicated to the group in that form, but left for the players to discover and learn over time. And the GM retains the option to break them at any time, as another important piece of the puzzle.<br/><br/>So I\u2019m not sure that it isn\u2019t just a specific technical application of free form GM-led roleplaying - but it could work through hand signals or ritual phrases or whatever else instead, you know, without changing the fundamental nature of play?<br/><br/><br/>* One of my points of confusion with this topic is that cannot seem to find any way understand the difference between \u201cbricolage\u201d and, well, \u201cplay\u201d - Exploration, the fundamental act of role playing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482467/#Comment_482467" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-24T04:38:47+00:00" title="April 24, 2019  4:38AM">April 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the difference between bricolage and just play?

(I haven't invited you to my party on Sunday unless it's obvious to everyone that I'm having a party on Sunday and want you to attend!) In THIS conversation, though, establishing and exploring the common ground IS the goal.<br/><br/>We establish that my vampire's territory abuts yours because we want our characters to come into conflict in the next arc.<br/><br/>We establish that my vampire's territory abuts yours because everything we know about the scenario so far demands it, and we're interested in the implications.<br/><br/>See the difference?<br/><br/>It's a necessary byproduct of play, but play isn't always, like, ABOUT it.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>I think rules as interlingua / shared context / building material are useful for facilitating that kind of play, semiotic jazz play, play where bricolage is privileged.<br/><br/>I think, also, that there's an unavoidable tension here between any such rules you choose to employ, and your ability to treat them as non-binding.

Forgive me as a good writer will post a synthesis of all of what has been posted, but that is a skill that is, unfortunately, beyond me.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a>,<br/><br/>I'd say your two most previous posts align with my thesis as I understand/developed it to date.  Your two points about Bricolage are spot on.  The first that Bricolage is a process that shows up in all forms of play was a point that Chris Lehrich made explicitly in his <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=14371.15" rel="nofollow">Bricolage Applied</a> thread long ago.  Your second point about Bricolage being <i>The Primary Process</i> of play in semiotic jazz (what this particular agenda is about) is also spot on.  I would also posit that Bricolage is an agnostic, generalized "problem solving technique" and that Setting is the primary source that determines <i>how</i> Bricolage is employed.  However while Setting is the primary/privileged source it is not the only source.  Character can and does enter the source material that influences how the Bricolage process is employed.  Finally, as you also indicated, there can be mechanics but they too ultimately function as grist for the Bricolage process.  Using your example of calling for a saving throw vs Dread not to determine what should happen next but rather as a <i>tool to communicate</i> to the players a <i>Very Important Piece of Information</i> quickly.\n<blockquote>I think, also, that there's an unavoidable tension here between any such rules you choose to employ, and your ability to treat them as non-binding. When you do that\u2014when you decide not to use a damage roll here, just to go straight to the dire wound\u2014you're flexing your muscles! Your trust and authority at the table better be able to back it up!</blockquote>\nAssuming that a group has a skilled DM who has earned the players' trust then the very act of not choosing to employ a mechanic is itself something that the players then mull over looking for something that might be being communicated to them.  Everything keeps feeding back into the Bricolage process.  If something doesn't happen that typically does, we don't go looking to fault the DM but rather we dig into the Setting and all the accumulated cruft to see if there is anything that can be deduced.  In diving in ever deeper into the Setting and bricoling a possible reason for the anomalous behavior we expand that Setting but the personal experience of the player makes if feel like an act of discovery.  Ala the elf singing an arrow out of tree where neither the Setting not play history had any such example of such an act but all the extant information about Elves, Middle Earth sources and previous play all suggest that this particular interpretation is not such a leap ultimately leads to an extension of Setting.  We "discovered" something new about ME, Elves in general and our character in particular.  Plus we've established precedent that said activity is plausible for at least some elves - we've created a new "rule" as it were.\n<blockquote>It's common ground that gets imbued with meaning through play. We get to discover, together, what it means to have your Swordsmanship skill at Surpassing. And who in the setting, PCs and NPCs, have that level of strength at arms. And what they can do.<br/><br/>It's an interlingua that helps us understand our own characters and the setting. I see the deor-wights tear through a party of characters with mostly Proficient and Advanced skill at arms, but my Swordsmanship, remember, is Surpassing! I know I'm a more skilled fighter and might have a chance.</blockquote>\nThis!  <br/><br/>We happen to use numbers in our particular game but these word based indicators of Swordsmanship skill beautifully illustrate the basic underpinnings of both Bricolage and the privilege of the Setting over mechanics.  We understand through play the various relationships of these skill levels and work to draw conclusions about them but they do not dictate for the player what he can or cannot accomplish.  Given Jeph's example I don't need any sort of privileged mechanic determining for me exactly what I can or can't successfully defeat but the idea of gauging one's possibilities against a foe we've only seen in action thus forcing us into making deductions, inductions, abductions, and not read about it in a Monster Manual is central to the whole process of play.  It makes us consider the Setting and the cruft of play before we state our intention that will be ground through the Bricolage Process that is informed by the Setting!<br/><br/>The nice thing about Bricolage is that it demands entailments.  Our actions or deductions or what not always have consequences.  The game constantly grows and expands in nearly boundless directions as we take actions in the game.  It just so happens that we place a very high value on our characters relationships and cultures so what makes combat really exciting are all the explicit, or really interestingly, the <i>implicit</i> stakes.  Because we are not bound by privileged mechanics but rather informed by Setting each players' experience of the game will not only be different but <i>should</i> be different.  One does not have to worry about parties of adventurers with everyone being nearly or equal level or there being some sort of "balance" to the various PC's.

Do you have an answer for me, Jay?</p></div></blockquote>\nSorry for the delay in responding to your question.  In short, Jeph had the right of it when he said, "Bricolage."<br/><br/>Right off the bat I have to hazard a guess what is actually meant by "freeform".  I hunted around the error free internet as to what "freeform" meant WRT creative art forms.  What I was able to roughly surmise was that "freeform" means just that - without form/structure.  Whatever the art form the artist is trying to communicate ideas or feelings (nearly) completely outside the normative sphere of communication methods.  Apply this understanding to RPG's I can only conclude we are talking about a mode of play that has no structured method for creating a meaningful experience.  Nor does it wish to have any meaningful <i>structure</i>.<br/><br/>(Mythic) Bricolage or Semiotic Jazz is extremely structured.  The exceedingly difficult part in understanding these modes is that means of conveying meaning are completely different from Western-Engineering thinking processes that we've grown up with.  Instead of using common Western abstracted systems - mechanics - to create the structures that convey/create meaning MB/SJ uses "concrete" objects and all their <i>structural</i> relationships to create or express meaning.  Bricolage feels sloppy and leads to all sorts of complications, which make it a mess for Western thought and engineering, but it is just the thing for ongoing, living, organically <i>growing</i> game (and Setting).  SJ with its playing with and using these meaning structures while being constrained by these selfsame structures is virtually diametrically opposed to "freeform" by definition.<br/><br/>To respond to the question to the second portion of the question of why SJ is different from "very very heavily Rule Zero-based play" I'd have to know more about the game in question.  Is this Rule Zero-based game some dysfunctional form of play like Illusionism or a form of Zilch-play Participationism?  Maybe it's a SJ game just out of the starting blocks and the GM is working to de-prioritize the mechanics and just hasn't yet fully migrated from a game designed to facilitate another CA.  Maybe its an abashed form of SJ. <br/> In the end, though, the real tell is - are the players engaged in the Bricolage Process <i>as a priority of play</i>?  Are the players emotionally invested in the "physical" Elements of Exploration (the Setting which includes the various personages) and their relationships/meanings (cultures, politics, etc.)?  Do they want to be involved in the Situation of the World for its own sake (IOW because the Setting resonates strongly with the players)?  I need to know because Rule Zero-Based play is just a Technique that says nothing about the <i>Priority</i> of play.<br/><br/>I know my communication skills aren't the best, but to me the difference between SJ and GM-led freeform, or very very heavily Rule Zero-based play is as stark as the G/N divide.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482556/#Comment_482556" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-25T13:20:50+00:00" title="April 25, 2019  1:20PM">April 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Right off the bat I have to hazard a guess what is actually meant by "freeform".

There's no gloss here and as I indicated in my post I had to synthesize a definition from other sources to then try and hazard a response.  I knew doing so was to run a risk of badly missing the mark but I allowed my eagerness to respond to a query get the best of me.<br/><br/>The problem is that moniker of "freeform", unfortunately, doesn't offer, in and of itself, any insight to the <i>priority</i> of play of the players.  And, unfortunately, "freeform" and "structure" as adjectives are nearly antonyms.  Hence the confusion to the unwashed like myself.  I look forward to your fuller explanation when you get the time.   <br/><br/>As an aside I find it notable the seeming contradiction of the name of the play style and your description of the style indicating that there exists much structure.

They're not written down in Jays' particular game, but if you were to write them down, you'd phrase them as "You may...", or "Often, you should..." rather than "You must...".<br/><br/>The fact that a given rule is not always applied exactly the same way in no way detracts from this!<br/><br/>Think about sarcasm:<br/><br/>When I ask if you want to go get ice cream and you pretend to throw up in your mouth and I say "Wow, you really love ice cream," can we conclude from this utterance that the phrase "really love" does not have consistent meaning in the English language?<br/><br/>Equivalently:<br/><br/>When I call for a Save versus Dread and the player rolls below their TN, but then instead of telling the player he cowers in fear I let him know that he freezes in a brief moment of panic but is able to overcome it quickly, can we conclude from this interaction that the rules for Save versus Dread do not have consistent meaning in my table's play?<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>If you can't tell, I tend to use linguistic metaphors a LOT when thinking about this kind of play\u2014especially from the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pragmatics</a>, which is pretty academically obscure but so, so so relevant to how we play.<br/><br/>So here's another metaphor:<br/><br/>In a lot of games, many rules play the role of grammar: they determine what is, or is not, valid play.

I was wrong.  I tried?  However, without trying to put words in anybody's mouth, using your proffered definition of "freeform" I get the sense that maybe we might be really talking about a system with few mechanics?  If that's not correct what does such a game have more freedom, by comparison, to what exactly?  What "restrictions" or what have you would such a game be bereft of?<br/><br/>However, in spending some time this morning re-reading and re-considering the question Paul_T had posed to me I came to realize something very important.  His question was ultimately about techniques and we know that techniques don't map one to one to CA's.  Certain techniques have a tendency to be better suited to supporting the expression of a CA and clever designers can go against the general grain of techniques in the effort to facilitate the expression of a CA to make a unique and fresh game.  (FREX - <i>Shadows In The Fog</i>, a game designed by Chris Lehrich, uses naked Bricolage and Tarot cards employed together as a deterministic/directive conflict resolution technique <i>in support of</i> Narrativist ends.)<br/><br/>Yet in neither of the two options of that Paul_T asked me about asked me about what the priority of play was and that was my fault for not seeing that.  I'm attempting to suss out how a particular CA works.  Jeph had the right of it when he mentioned Bricolage (or perhaps Setting inspired and constrained Bricolage) as the Priority of SJ play.  The interesting thing about Bricolage as the priority of play is that it ultimately creates everything else (Character growth,additional Setting, and even the "rules" of the world) but most centrally it is a <i>meaning creation process</i>.  Specifically I mean it creates meaningful experiences for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482573/#Comment_482573" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-25T21:56:00+00:00" title="April 25, 2019  9:56PM">April 25</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2019 11:14PM by Silmenume.">edited April 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The significant aspect here is that <b>there are no consistent rules</b>; instead, the judgement of the GM supersedes whatever rules might appear to be in place, case by case.</p></div></blockquote>\nNot true at all.  <i>The GM is just as constrained in his choices as the players</i> are by the Setting, Bricolage and all the cruft that has accumulated over the course of play.  This is a key element I keep trying to hammer home.  The does not make decisions arbitrarily simply because of the lack of or the de-prioritization of the Western Thinking derived abstract mechanics.  The Setting and the accumulation of player choices constrains the options the GM has available to him.  If you go back to Chris' post on Levi-Strauss on how Bricolage make a good analogy for myth an absolutely vital element of the analogy is the so called "shed" of pre-existing pieces that the bricoleur <i>must</i> use.  When faced with a problem in the structure the Bricoleur can't just engineer the perfect part but must use only what is readily available to him.  His is constrained.  So is the GM.  The earlier mentioned "shed" is the Setting and the accumulated cruft of the Bricolage Process that all the players including the GM have created during play.<br/><br/>Mechanics are the equivalent of the specifically engineered piece which is great for its one specific task but is nearly or completely useless for any other.  Bricolage is this creative solution process that is constrained by what is and the limited only by the imagination of the Bricoleur within those constraints.  The key here is that the "part" used is never a perfect solution and always leads to further problems/opportunities.  So on continues the Bricoleur.  In extending the analogy whatever the players do that ends up in the SIS ends up in the "shed" to be used later.<br/><br/>These two methods of problem solving; Western Engineering design that seeks perfection and Bricolage with its expected and desired entailments are mutually exclusive.  What this means that as a process of play the privileges Bricolage (SJ) will definitionally not place much emphasis on mechanics and certainly places Setting and the constrained player choices to the fore.  This means playing a published game with mechanics but constantly invoking Rule-Zero is not the same as a game the Prioritizes Bricolage in the first place.  Who knows why a GM is invoking Rule-Zero all the time?  We have to know what is actually happening.  Is the Rule-Zero GM attempting to Engineer the perfect implicit rules set or are his actions attempting to Prioritize Bricolage constrained by Setting?<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482575/#Comment_482575" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-25T23:14:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2019 11:14PM">April 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">@Paul_D_L</a>, \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" rel="nofollow">Paul_D_L</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Your and <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph%27s">@Jeph's</a> description of your personal approach includes a GM.

I can only parse the question and possibly bring up new questions as part of what I'm really trying to do is figure out what is absolutely core and what are techniques.<br/><br/>As was discussed a long while back it was agreed that "GM" is really a set of additional responsibilities that a player has.  This is "discovery" to the flowering of games that were "GM-less" because the responsibilities of the "GM" were distributed among the players at the table.  If your asking if the responsibilities of the "GM" can be distributed among the players at the table I'd can only answer, "I'm not sure.  I'm inclined to think no, but I'm not closed to being shown otherwise."  I only know from my game that it really sucks you into the first person POV.  I'm <i>not</i> saying one must play from the 1st person POV (I forget the name of that stance) but it's very hard not to fall into it.  Jumping out to handle some other non-character related task would be extremely disorienting as there is just so much information that must be kept in mind at all times.\n<blockquote>...your personal approach includes a GM. That's a rule/mechanic.</blockquote>\nThat's another interesting question.  It "feels" very meta.  A "rule" that a single person shoulders the responsibilities of the GM does not intersect in any way with the Setting.  IOW Setting has nothing to say about the very Idea of a GM.  I'm sorry.  I don't have the intellectual tools to parse this out properly but it "feels" like a divide by zero type issue or perhaps a category error - like asking Science which deals only with the tangible world to make a statement about something metaphysical.  It's like a category error type of question.  I don't know.  <br/><br/>Is there someone out there smarter than myself who could take a crack at this?<br/><br/>I will note that we do have some very hard and fast rules about player behavior.  No player may at any time criticize the play of another player.  Penalties are harsh and can eventually lead to ejection from the group.  If someone has a problem with a player's play then bring it up to the GM in private.  There is absolutely no contact permitted by a player in combat with another player at the table - even if its accidental.  Emotions run high and hot during combat and accidents can escalate.  Heavy penalties here as well.  No cheating on dice rolls.  This is a zero tolerance policy.  You get caught once and you are immediately ejected from the group - permanently.  These are stated at the beginning of every game.  I don't remember enough to recall if these are Social Contract level rules or not.<br/><br/>The idea behind all of these is that we are there to get into the emotional rush of the game and feel free to let it all "hang out".  We don't want anything to impinge upon feeling the freedom to do so.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>PS - Really neat questions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482577/#Comment_482577" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-26T00:13:44+00:00" title="April 26, 2019 12:13AM">April 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess what I'm hoping to get at is clarity about which rules you think should flow from and be subordinate to setting. Because it seems to me that many of the ones you use don't do that. I'm not trying to catch you contradicting yourself, on the contrary, I just sense you're coming in with assumptions about what rules "count," so to speak. Like, to you, a flexible mechanic is how to handle dumping boiling oil on an army of orcs, but the GM role or character ownership is simply a feature of the entire exercise.<br/><br/>So, I think the answers to pretty much all of your questions and thoughts here will necessarily begin with answering what rules you see as features, why you see them that way and see other rules differently, and so forth.<br/><br/>One potentially useful way to look at it is that each rule, feature or not, is an attempt to solve a problem: "How do we achieve X experience?" From that standpoint, could a rule that constrains/steers do so <i>towards</i> the discovery, consistency, and sovereignty of the setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482578/#Comment_482578" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-26T00:47:48+00:00" title="April 26, 2019 12:47AM">April 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Paul.

The problem is that the process/priority of play is extinct in the Western-literate culture.  There really are no <i>common</i> words to concisely describe/abstract what's going on.  The closest description I've encountered was Chris Lehrich's use of Claude Levi-Strauss' Mythic Bricolage.  The problems there are that the myth being references is not the Western literate myths but those of tribal cultures and Bricolage is a french term of an art process.

Another one that belongs to this group that is truly foundational is "pre-literate myth".  I'm am not formally educated in these subjects and what I have learned was from some critical posts I read on the Forge about 14 years ago.  If you truly are interesting in coming to some sort of understanding I'd recommend very strongly that you read the post's authored by Chris Lehrich in these following threads.  Be aware that while he does try to make the subject matter accessible it is by its very nature is dense.

You, as a participant, don\u2019t know ahead of time how something will be handled - you just have to play and see - and there is never a moment where you could say, \u201chang on, now!

So, yes, I am certain there are lots of unexamined assumptions plaguing my efforts.  That being said, as I am still working out just what the core of this Creative Agenda exactly and how it works in play and what the players are doing. I don't yet have a truly solid metric to say this is fundamental and these things are definitely open to design freedom.  FREX - Narrativism's core process of play is <i>Address of Premise</i> which to the player feels like <i>Story Now!</i>.  Same with Gamism's core process of play <i>Address of Challenge</i> which creates the <i>experience</i> of <i>Step On Up</i> for the player.  For these descriptions to work both Premise and Challenge needed to be thought about and debated before the further implications of design could be fully explored.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm not working on game design per se but on sussing out the core process of the Creative Agenda that for the nonce I'm calling Semiotic Jazz because the previous name carries way too much baggage.  However, even the descriptor name of Semiotic Jazz does not effectively encompass the idea I'm working towards.  FREX - Improv Jazz has standards but they don't change and grow by the Soloists' play.  So as a descriptor it SJ helps with some of concepts and as an idea can be discussed by those who study music and semiotics.  But the part where the act of playing the instrument does not change the Standard is a serious shortcoming of the analogy as useful as it is in many aspects.  So now we must step back to an older but even more arcane (yet much more accurate) descriptor of process called Mythic Bricolage.<br/><br/>The reason I brought up Mythic Bricolage is that in order to answer your questions one must first understand how preliterate-tribal Myth works.  Unfortunately my understanding is cursory at best and the person was the expert on this is not on these boards.  Here's a few things that I think I understand.  The "purpose" (if that is indeed the appropriate word) of Myth is to establish humanity's place in the world and to provide order and structure to the chaos that is life.  This is to give <b>stability and meaning</b> to life.  The process of myth is astoundingly alien to Western style abstraction based thought.  It's just plain non-existent so a matter of pop culture there no words to describe it and there is no understanding of it outside a very small group of anthropologists and lit-crit types. This makes talking about this particular CA process (Semiotic Jazz/mythic bricolage) extraordinarily difficult.<br/><br/>Going back to "how" myth works, myth starts with the "concrete" objects of the physical world.  Some sort of <i>relationship</i> is established between the person/humanity and the "concrete"/physical object.  FREX - an eagle is observed and rather "abstracting" the bird by giving a genus species name and generating a list of abstractions about the eagle as in an "objective" fashion.  Rather the tribal member living in a mythic culture establishes a "reason" for the eagle and then weaves that reason using the myth process into the greater tapestry of the entire myth culture.  This is not done using "abstractions" but by using other "concrete" objects in a structural fashion where the "relationship" of pieces generates the meaning.  But using these other "concrete" object is messy because they come with their whole bundle of structural relationship meanings.  These myths are absolutely not narrative stories that use abstracted words using the abstracted rules of grammar to convey an idea. Finally when something new must be addressed a new myth is created and added to the vast cultural corpus but it is done so in a way to show that the "problem" of something existing outside their understanding of the world (here's the stability part I mentioned earlier) was never really outside their understanding of the world in the first place.  IOW myth is a process of <i>working through</i> as well as a cultural framework.<br/><br/>This myth process is self-affirming.  FREX - while the West might become excited about a new discovery and revel in its newness to our world the mythic culture attempts to find a way to demonstrate that the "new" discovery was never really new because it always existed within the totality of the cultural myths and this new myth demonstrates how that was so.<br/><br/>The takeaways from this are that myth is supremely subjective and constantly evolving over time without drawing attention to this evolutionary process as they need their world view to be resilient and to cover absolutely everything.<br/><br/>I'm arguing that the CA I'm describing functions like myth in a process that Claude Levi-Strauss likened, by analogy to help make understanding of myth easier, as the French art movement of Bricolage.  This has important and fundamental implications when we map this process over to role-play.  I'll go into that in my follow up post.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482735/#Comment_482735" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-30T01:03:08+00:00" title="April 30, 2019  1:03AM">April 30</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2019 1:03AM by Paul_T.">edited April 30</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

I've laid a foundation.  Next I will build upon it.  I was motivated to spends lots of time researching and writing my post because some of the questions that keep cropping up don't make sense in light of the framework I've attempted to provide.  (I also provided the post as part of a generalized request to make accessible ideas or concepts that can be rather specific)  In other cases the answer I'll provide won't make sense for the same reasons.<br/><br/>Finally I will add this last little bit about Myth which is a direct quote from Chris Lehich from a thread of mine back in '05 called <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13909.msg148499#msg148499" rel="nofollow">Sim is Bricolage and makes myth - comments?</a>.\n<blockquote>The elements of myth are, at base, the elements of the natural world.  These have no meaning intrinsically; the meaning is imputed to them through human creative interpretation -- which is a part of what bricolage is about.  Once such meanings have been imputed, they can be further manipulated by connection to other mythic elements, and so on and so forth forever.</blockquote>\nI think the above gives a very good idea of where I will be going with my next post.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482764/#Comment_482764" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-30T16:50:30+00:00" title="April 30, 2019  4:50PM">April 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482779/#Comment_482779" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-30T19:14:54+00:00" title="April 30, 2019  7:14PM">April 30</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2019 6:39PM by Silmenume.">edited May 1</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (After completing this section and seeing just how many important ideas were needed to be included I realized that I'm going to have to move my actual intended writings to yet another post.  My <i>sincerest</i> apologies for a post of only definitions.  I know some have mentioned they feel such "jargon" heavy posts are off putting but I didn't see a way around this and still cover the ideas that I need to.  In this case I think it important but perhaps a more skilled writer could have written something in a more generally accessible manner.  For me I saw a post that constantly had to digress to offer definitions.  I hope this doesn't turn anyone away who has been following this thread so far.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Ok, here goes...<br/><br/>Earlier in this thread <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> had brought up an important idea - "establishing common ground is a fundamental part of any conversation.".  To that end I will attempt to define or reference a couple of definitions of terms that got blurred in usage in this thread.  My own writings probably some of the worst.  The below terms and definitions lifted directly from the <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">Provisional Glossary</a> from the Forge. The parts in parenthesis at the end of the definitions are my notations.<br/><br/>Creative Agenda (CA) - The aesthetic priorities and any matters of imaginative interest regarding role-playing. Three distinct Creative Agendas are currently recognized: Step On Up (Gamist), The Right to Dream (Simulationist), and Story Now (Narrativist)  ... Creative Agenda is expressed using all Components of Exploration, but most especially System.<br/><br/>Components of Exploration (Sometimes referred to as the Elements of Exploration) - <br/>In combination, the necessary parts of the imaginary content of a role-playing situation. Separately, they include Character, Setting, Situation, System, Color; see Exploration.  (This is the description of the "parts" necessary to define role-play as role-play and not some other activity like theater or chess or a game of basketball, etc.)<br/><br/>Exploration - The imagination of fictional events, established through communicating among one another. Exploration includes five Components: Character, Setting, Situation, System, and Color.  (This refers to the <i>process</i> where we are actually/actively engaged in the act of role-playing.  It is at this level where Creative Agenda finds actual expression).<br/><br/>Rules - Textual instruction about (a) anything and everything concerning role-playing this particular game, or <b>(b) specifically Techniques and Ephemera. Used in this sense, Rules are distinct from the System actually employed during play</b>, although it may be used as a reference or justification for it. (For the purposes of my upcoming discussion I am referencing meaning (b).  <i>This is very important</i>.)<br/><br/>System - The means by which imaginary events are established during play, including character creation, resolution of imaginary events, reward procedures, and more. It may be considered to introduce fictional time into the Shared Imagined Space. See also the Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>Resolution (This is where game design, specifically that part which is typically called Mechanics or sometimes Resolution Mechanics, are employed) - Establishing fictional events into the time-sequence of the Shared Imaginary Space. Includes Drama (the result is spoken without the use of the following two - Fortune (any randomizer) Karma (comparison of values) , IIEE, and narration, among other things. A necessary feature of System.  (IIEE is a rather difficult concept that tries to formalize that exact moment in play when a player attempting something in play that will call for some sort of resolution mechanics - useful virtually only to game designers)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482844/#Comment_482844" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-01T23:20:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2019 11:20PM">May 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, <i>finally</i>, onto <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">@Paul_D_L</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> questions. \n<blockquote>I guess what I'm hoping to get at is clarity about which rules you think should flow from and be subordinate to setting.</blockquote>\nPaul_D_L offered this specific question -\n<blockquote>Your and <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph%27s">@Jeph's</a> description of your personal approach includes a GM. That's a rule/mechanic. Is that rule subordinate to the setting? Is the very existence of a GM privileged?</blockquote>\nPart of what took me time to untangle was to realize that certain keywords were used in ways that not in accord to what I had learned.  I provided the definitions I had learned above so that we can both talk about your question effectively.<br/><br/>When I entitled this thread I was sloppy with the word "mechanics".  A more precise phrasing would have had me using the phrase "Resolution Mechanics."  To be precise "Resolution Mechanics" are those overt procedures of play where a players input is being put through the Validation Process.<br/><br/>FREX - Bob: "I kill the Orc with my sword"<br/>GM: "Roll a twenty sided..."<br/><br/>The GM has just called for the employment of a "Resolution Mechanic" to determine...well... its actually a little complicated.<br/><br/>Just what exact part of Bob's statement is the GM calling for the "Resolution Mechanic" into play for?  Do the "Resolution Mechanics" allow for a such an action (a direct kill) or do the "Resolution Mechanics" only allow for attempts to strike and if successful then determining damage (and whatever other things that the "Resolution Mechanics" deal with specifically)?  This example may seem an off topic but it is absolutely central to my main point.  See, in all cases, whether there is an overt out of the book specific "Resolution Mechanic" or the process is more implicit like Bricolage the person who's responsible for the Validating of player input must make a judgement.  Either on which "Resolution Mechanic" best lines up with the player's statement of action or to ask for clarification or to just make a ruling (Mythic Bricolage).  This all follows under System but the understanding that <i>every</i> System of Resolution is subject to a judgement call no matter how objective the "Resolution Mechanics" try to make the game is the Lumpley Principle in action.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the Lumpley Principle asserts the following - "System (including but not limited to 'the rules') is defined as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">means by which the group agrees to imagined events during play</span>."  Emphasis added.<br/><br/>The takeaway is that human beings are playing and are all involved (usually tacitly) in deciding (agreeing) what actions (imagined events) are allowed into the Shared Imagined Space (SIS).  The Shared Imagined Space is a descriptor for the sum total of all imagined events that all the players have in their minds that have been introduced during the process of play.  An example of this process in action could be - <br/><br/>Bob: "I drop my empty six gun and ignite my lightsaber."<br/>DM: "What?  No!  We're playing a western not a science fantasy game"<br/><br/>Note no overt "Resolution Mechanic" was called for, as none exists for this particular circumstance, but rather the DM made a fiat ruling based on his understanding of the Setting.  Yet, another player <i>might</i> contest this ruling by saying, "You know, I think it would make for an interesting addition to the game if a lightsaber was allowed."  Until the table all agrees on whatever consensus they eventually come to play effectively stops.<br/><br/>However both System (the Lumpley Principle) and its subcategory of "Resolution Mechanics" are all in service to the Creative Agenda at the table.  Whether or not a specific rules derived "Resolution Mechanic" is called for by the person wielding GM authority is <i>always</i> a matter of judgment.  The ultimate and distal criterion used to inform that judgment is the Creative Agenda that the players at the table are expressing and the proximal by the current circumstances of the Shared Imagined Space.<br/><br/>In this CA that I've been calling Semiotic Jazz the "Resolution Mechanic" (aka System/The Lumpley Principle) is Mythic Bricolage.  So when I posed the question in the title of my thread it was for the purpose to set the framework in the readers and posters minds of what Semiotic Jazz play might look like.  You see, that "Resolution Mechanics" derived from the printed "Rules" in the text of a book and Mythic Bricolage are fundamentally incompatible.  One category tries to be definitive and objective while the other is "sloppy" and supremely subjective respectively.<br/><br/>Having established (mythic) Bricolage as a "Resolution Mechanic" and a Creative Agenda priority/process changes the nature of certain roles.  Consider that Myth "wants" to expand and encompass the totality of all reality as means of giving stability and meaning to human existence.  That means if we wish to play this particular CA strong boundaries between our reality and that of the one established and played with in game need to be maintain.  The stronger these boundaries the deeper the players can dive into the Mythic Bricolage meaning creation process.  Who is to enforce these boundaries?  I would argue such a role is best suited to a single individual - the GM.<br/><br/>To answer your question - if "Mechanics" is subordinate to Setting what does that mean WRT to the role of the GM - First I would have to ask do you mean "Resolution Mechanics"?  Or are you asking a question about the textural "Rules" that help establish the form of play without reference to System/Lumpley Principle which deal directly with establishing facts in the Shared Imagined Space?  Upon reflection I think that these distinction miss the point of the deeper question about how Mythic Bricolage works.<br/><br/>To pursue your question I'll include the following quote regarding Myth(ic Bricolage) in this thread for a second time -\n<blockquote>The elements of myth are, at base, the elements of the natural world. These have no meaning intrinsically; the meaning is imputed to them through human creative interpretation -- which is a part of what bricolage is about. Once such meanings have been imputed, they can be further manipulated by connection to other mythic elements, and so on and so forth forever.</blockquote>\nThe natural world in role-play is the Setting, which would include PC's and NPC's.  A player who is playing the SJ (with its de-privileged "Resolution Mechanics") cannot add to "the elements of the natural world" ex nihilo.  But one person can if the act is constrained by and informed by the totality of the SIS - the GM.<br/><br/>So by Bricolage's very nature as mapped to role-play I would argue very strongly that the role of GM cannot be devolved out of the table nor distributed among the players because the act of creating ex-nihilo would be in breaking with the Bricolage process.  As would employing privileged/deterministic "Resolution Mechanics".  "Resolution Mechanics" can be employed as long as they are non-deterministic and are subject to Bricolage (not privileged)<br/><br/>Ugh...my summary was rushed, I ran out of gas thus I have a feeling I'll have to revisit it.  I hope this proved fruitful to someone.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483006/#Comment_483006" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T22:01:23+00:00" title="May  7, 2019 10:01PM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2019 4:57AM by Silmenume.">edited May 9</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking now for a few days about what the Mythic Bricolage (Semiotic Jazz) process of thinking might look like mapped onto roleplaying.<br/><br/>I think it best to consider the qualities of Myth and then see where there they can be applied.<br/><br/>First - mythic problem solving process, as opposed to the Western/Engineering problem solving process, is supremely <i>subjective</i>.  The only "objective" truths are on the player's sheet but even that information doesn't map back into the Shared Imagined Space as "Objective Truths".  FREX - I might have a strength of 17 (out of 18) but such a value doesn't map back into the SIS as something like a maximum deadlift of 250 lbs.  Just as in real life I don't have the ability to look at some object, instinctively know its weight then exert some sort of measurable and reliable maximum effort to lift it.  What I do know is that I'm relatively stronger than a 16 and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>I</b> have to deduce from the SIS</span> just what that means.  Given that Mythic Bricolage (SJ) is supremely subjective that means any information the GM gives out about Setting will also be delivered in a way that is subjective and open to interpretation...<br/><br/>...and that's an Extremely Important Process Of Play.<br/><br/>As a member of a myth based culture makes sense of the world as it <i>relates</i> to the individual/tribe so it is with Semiotic Jazz/Mythic Bricolage.  Contrast this with "Western" style thinking where the object is attempted to be understood as a thing unto itself without reference to the observer or his/her biases.  This process leads to an "abstraction" based method of problem solving.  By employing abstraction we can tailor create descriptions that work extremely well and cleanly for that particular object/phenomena but are pretty useless for other tasks.  Finally this thinking process says nothing about how the object relates to the human condition.  This is what is meant by "Western Engineering" thinking process.  Its efficient but very tight in scope and cares not for the human condition.  Myth is, by comparison, very sloppy but extremely versatile and is extremely concerned with how the world relates to people.<br/><br/>Going back to role-play (Exploration as defined above) this means that while there can be resolution mechanics (a typically objective and deterministic process) they are always subject to the (prioritized) Mythic Bricolage process which is definitionally rooted in the Setting (the physical world).<br/><br/>For example - There can be what looks like a typical combat resolution system but in practise this resolution mechanic process is really grist for Bricolage.  We as players don't have any information about the HP's, AC, armor effectiveness or any "special abilities" of the foes we're fighting.  This <i>does not mean</i> the DM is making uninformed/unguided/capricious judgment calls nor are the players completely without information about the monsters.  WRT the monsters that information is deduced from the information the DM gives <i>descriptively</i> in feedback to our actions of which the dice play their own varied roles.<br/><br/>Let's say I'm +5 to hit with my long sword which does D12 damage plus strength modifiers of +2 and I'm fighting an orc something that looks similar to a long sword as well.  On the surface a fairly standard combat set up.  However the player has no intelligence yet on the "level" of the orc (HPs) or AC or weapon skill (+'s to hit).<br/><br/>Player - "I swing."<br/>DM - "Roll."<br/>Player - "10...plus 5...15 total!"<br/>Not a bad roll.  That's what would traditionally be an AC 5 hit in a deterministic resolution system.  Rather in Mythic Bricolage this is a starting point for interpretation for DM and player.<br/>DM - "He knocks your sword aside.  Your sword is way out of position as he thrusts at you. Roll."<br/>Player - "Oh crap!  Avoid!  I spin away! ... uh...Natural 17!"<br/>DM - "The sword just skitters across your chest cutting a hole in your shirt!  That would have been your death."<br/>Player - "I try and trap his arm and break his elbow!"<br/>DM - "Dangerous. Dangerous. Add your hand to hand.  Don't roll poorly..."<br/>Player - "uh....12....plus 6....18!"<br/>DM - "You're in position...roll to hit."<br/>Player - "Weapon or hand to hand?"<br/>DM - "Hand to hand...Roll a natural 18, 19, or 20 and you break his arm outright"<br/>Player - "Oh man! 17 total!"<br/>DM - "Roll D4 for damage."<br/>Player - "2...add Str Damage?"<br/>DM - nods<br/>Player - "4 total!"<br/>DM - grunts, "The arm doesn't yield.  He spins to face you and you see his gauntleted fist coming straight at your face."<br/>Player - "I release my lock and avoid the blow."<br/>DM - "This is going to hit unless you roll something truly spectacular"<br/>Player - "NATURAL 20!<br/>DM - "He's surprised by your maneuver and stumbles past...You're in perfect position!"<br/>Player - "Full smote from behind!"<br/>DM - "Add +6 to your roll!"<br/>Player - "6 plus 5...uh...plus...17 total!<br/>DM - "Add the +1 for a full smote."<br/>Player - "18!"<br/>DM - "Roll percentile and double your damage roll."<br/>Player - "45 on the percentile and 8 plus 2...uh....doubled...20 points!"<br/>DM - "You crush him in the back.  He stumbles to a knee but gets back up.  Roll a 20."<br/>Player - "What do I add?"<br/>DM - "Just roll..."<br/>Player - "16!"<br/>DM - "Put a check down for sight.  You see that under his shirt you can now see broken chain links and blood.  Put a check down for perception.  You also note that you should have killed him but he's turning to face you with a snarl."<br/>Player - "Crap..."<br/><br/>I'll file another post to break down the combat and how it was handled demonstrates mythic style bricolage and not your standard deterministic resolution mechanics system.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483043/#Comment_483043" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-08T20:45:10+00:00" title="May  8, 2019  8:45PM">May 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jay,<br/><br/>I have a number of thoughts on this, but I have to brief! Please don't take my rather short answer as a lack of interest or enthusiasm. I'm really glad this discussion is ongoing, and loving the way you're digging into this playstyle in this public forum. I find it educational and inspiring!<br/><br/>1. The challenge with this playstyle I keep coming back to is that it's very difficult to determine which elements are supportive/fundamental to the playstyle, and which are a quirk of your group's "house rules" and Cary's personal preferences, as well as a history of being "based in D&amp;D" to whatever extent.<br/><br/>I struggled with the idea that ability scores, levels, and other "objective" scores were included in this at all. Earlier in one of these threads I mentioned that you could throw out Strength scores and such and still be playing the same game (perhaps even one that's all the more in line with the Semiotic Jazz idea), and you corrected me, saying I'd misunderstood.<br/><br/>I'm still unsure about that, though. You paint a great picture of how "mythic bricolage" is all about a subjective experience of the fictional Setting and its reality, rather than an objective one.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>First - mythic problem solving process, as opposed to the Western/Engineering problem solving process, is supremely <i>subjective</i>.

The example of combat is excellent! Based on what I know about your game, it looks so accurate as to make me wonder whether it's an actual transcript from a real game session. Would you be willing to discuss particular details in there, or are most of them a case of, "Well, I don't know - that's just how Cary does it"? (For instance, why in the world bring in skill checks/marks in the middle of a fight? That seems like odd timing, but it could be as simple as, "Cary just calls for these when they come to mind!")<br/><br/>3. I keep coming back to the issue of whether what you're discussing in this playstyle is a) thoroughly integrated to the techniques being used in the game (perhaps a form of Technical Agenda - "we're used to playing this way"), b) a fundamental question of the creative agenda ("why are we playing this; what are we trying to do?") at work, or c) a perfect cohesive unit of the two working together (which is how you are presenting this, if I understand you correctly).<br/><br/>At the moment, I see all three as entirely possible.<br/><br/>But the whole concept of Semiotic Jazz and "privileging the Setting" is an interesting one, and, it seems to me, at least potentially entirely orthogonal to that actual techniques being employed by your group.<br/><br/>As a very different and contrasting example, I've been reading <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen%27s">@Eero_Tuovinen's</a> threads about his Prydain campaign here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21762/d-d-4th-chronicles-of-prydain-campaign-notes/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21762/d-d-4th-chronicles-of-prydain-campaign-notes/p1</a><br/><br/>In terms of Technical Agenda, you couldn't get further apart: a structured "plot" with a branching structure, almost like a board game, heavy use of objective/highly structured mechanics, battlemats, miniatures, and so forth.<br/><br/>In terms of creative goals, though, there seems to be a lot of overlap. It's a game with a heavily GM-led structure that celebrates and builds on a beloved Setting and story, while allowing the players some leeway to put their own mark on it. For instance, see how Eero frames the class choices in D&amp;D in the context of the Prydain setting (towards the end of the thread). The focus is on learning about, experiencing, and deepening our understanding and depiction of this story and its setting.<br/><br/>There is heavy "bricolage" happening, where the rules and structures of the game are used in somewhat unconventional ways to contextualize the desired story and setting, rather than being followed as procedures to see what comes out. The mechanics are all being applied, in other words, in service of the desired story, setting, and themes, with those that don't apply being ignored or rejected (e.g. race and class choices). The mechanics are definitely "subordinate to game play as opposed to directive" (to quote the title of this thread), in other words.<br/><br/>What does this look like to you, Jay? Can you see the similarities, and enough so to be able to say that, yes, this is a very similar Creative Agenda at work, despite the nearly opposite/inverse relationship of the particular techniques being used? Or do you feel that the technical aspects of your gameplay are important enough that this style of play seems like total anathema to what your group gets out of the game? In either case, I think you'll find that thread (and the one linked to it, previously) quite an interesting read.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483054/#Comment_483054" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-09T05:08:21+00:00" title="May  9, 2019  5:08AM">May 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>If you are willing, I ask you to be patient with me.

We don't know who the PC is, where he is, why he's there, his cultural background and his personal history in the game.  This is critical as all the above informs the stakes and thus infuses the combat with  all its meanings beyond the tactical defeat of a monster/foe.  What does it mean to the Setting if I win?  Flee?  Perish?  Let the orc flee is he runs?  <i>Why</i> am I engaging in the first place?  Will the act of engaging this orc bring harm/benefit to my goals/the Setting?  ...and so on with as many ideas race through our minds in such a situation. <br/><br/>Without the above information and the understanding of just how primary they are to the game play process the combat looks superficially Gamist in general process.  Like myth everything is interconnected and derives its meanings from these interconnections.  Without the contextual information/the interconnections of Character to self and Setting and then how all that context relates to the event of the combat it becomes perilously easy to mistake it for something that it isn't.  The superficial crunchiness of the combat without the context makes it look like Address of Challenge.  All those matters of context makes it superficially appear to look like Premise might be lurking within but we are not dealing with a Single Issue nor are all the questions difficult problematic human issues.  Myth concerns itself with <i>everything</i> that relates to how the world relates to man/mankind in a <i>meaningful</i> way.  The upshot is that without the context this example of combat does miss the mark in a very profound, fundamental way.<br/><br/>Even the seemingly "object" numbers are really just more "concrete objects" (as opposed to "abstracted ideas") with their own entailments and cruft that are subjective in meaning and only have meaning WRT the SIS and its Setting.  Like I said in the example a final roll of '15' ONLY has meaning in so far as it affects the SIS.  Its not that we do the math and then call out to the DM, "I hit Armor Class 5!"  "Armor Class 5" is an "abstraction" that exists outside the SIS.  To us its a both a shortcut to communicate an idea (with lots of entailments) and just as importantly its "meaning" is derived from what happens in the SIS as the result of generating and reporting it.  IOW what does that '15' mean?  Outside the SIS it means nothing per se.  Because of what is reported back to the player though the SIS it accumulates a generalized <i>meaning</i>. I.e., It's a decent roll and <i>likely to mean</i> that something is going to take damage.  We don't know its <i>specific meaning</i> until we get information back from the SIS.  And here's the kicker - <i>we don't want to know the meaning objectively</i>.  We want to deduce for ourselves the meanings from the concrete events as they are presented from the SIS.\n<blockquote>DM - "He knocks your sword aside. Your sword is way out of position as he thrusts at you. Roll."<br/>Player - "Oh crap! Avoid! I spin away! ... uh...Natural 17!"<br/>DM - "The sword just skitters across your chest cutting a hole in your shirt! That would have been your death."</blockquote>\nAs a '15' attack roll typically means a hit the player above has deduced several things very quickly for the reported response.  First - this Orc is either far more skilled than he originally supposed or just got very lucky.  Second - Either way the PC is in serious trouble because at the moment he's way out of position and, metaphorically speaking, he's looking down the barrel of a gun.  Third - He deduces that because his weapon is so far out of position that the PC is better off trying to avoid the incoming sword rather than try and do something like parry.<br/><br/>Note - the DM didn't actually say just how badly the sword was out of position.  The DM just reported it as such and it was up to the player to make the determination based on long experience with the process of play (the accumulated SIS) and what he was willing to risk depending on all the contextual issues noted above.<br/><br/>The player rolls a natural (unmodified) '17' but again he doesn't know what that means objectively.  Long history of the SIS informs the player that higher numbers are better than lower numbers and that an unmodified 17 is pretty high.  The DM will take into <i>consideration</i> the subjective momentum of battle, who has initiative and who is reacting (in the military sense not as a matter of game mechanics), the PC's AC, his Agility, if he has any particular skills that might matter and how fast the player reacted.  If the player is slow responding then his character is slow in responding.  Speed kills.  The use of the term "Avoid" is shorthand method for communicating the idea that the character is putting a strong effort as moving his body out of the way and will to put any immediate follow up attack at a disadvantage.  An avoid gives the player a +4 to the roll he made.  In this instance he forgot to add the number to his roll because 17 is a pretty good number and the stress of the moment drove it out of his mind.  The DM however also takes this number into consideration with all the others that I indicated above.  However we still have no idea what that +4 "means" objectively.  We deduce through the SIS what the effects appear to be and we gain a generalized sense of its effectiveness along with the fact adding 4 is 20% of a D20.  A best we understand that it's a decent boost but we don't know its effect until we get feedback from the SIS.<br/><br/>The DM responds that the Orc's sword just barely misses the player.  Note the DM never announced his own die roll...because it doesn't matter.  <i>What matters is what happens in the SIS</i>.  It's up to player to deduce more pieces of information about his foe from the SIS.  First - that because of the relative value of his die rolls and actions that his for more likely to be pretty skilled and experienced and not just lucky.  Second - The DMs pronouncement about the PCs life buttresses the idea that the Orc is likely going to be both very hard to kill and very dangerous in return.<br/><br/>Supposing the Orc is really of a decent level and isn't just lucky the DM is constrained in his actions just as the player is.  For the sake of argument let's say the DM has classified the Orc as something around 8th level.  This "level" is not an objective value with specific mechanical meanings rather it informs the DM as to the generalized skill level of Orc, how difficult he'll be to hit, what his general morale level is and how crafty he'll be in combat.  The DM starts with the concrete object of "Orc" all the entailments that means.  Then he adds another structural glob of meanings with the object "level" and all the entailments that brings.  These objects <i>aid with consistency</i> but are not employed as objective things operated upon without regard to the SIS.<br/><br/>Ugh - this is going on and on.  I hope I've conveyed the idea that this whole process is supremely subjective concerned primarily with meaning creation rather than an objective process to adjudicate a result free of "bias."<br/><br/>I'll write a response to your post after I've had a bit to recharge.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483086/#Comment_483086" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-09T21:11:45+00:00" title="May  9, 2019  9:11PM">May 9</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds as though there are a host of mechanical processes that are mostly concealed from the players and known to the GM (a variety of dice roll results, where a 'success' on one roll looks entirely different from the same 'success' in another circumstance).

Some of us (myself potentially included; I'm still learning) see the strong-GM-author-control techniques and the opaque game procedures and see that familiar "90s roleplaying vibe". Jay (Silmenume), I believe, is trying to present what his group is doing as a very distinct kind of creative pursuit, with its own goals and principles and setting up as distinct from all of that. (If I am correct! Jay hasn't actually stated his position on whether what his group does is meaningfully distinct from "90s" or "middle school" roleplaying - they certainly share elements of Rule Zero, "Mother May I" GM techniques, a strong focus on "no metagaming" and similar details.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeph" rel="nofollow">Jeph</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I sort of think of 90s games as an abashed, self-hating version of the play style at Jay and Cary's table.

There were lots of people who were totally into it (and probably still are; I just haven't played with any in a long time, so I'm not entirely sure!). But, at least from Jay's accounts, there's a strong love and passion present for this style of play, and that's a really important detail.

The slightly longer version is that rather than rolling on the same granularity as the players he rolls less frequently for the larger time frame flow of events.  Only very rarely does he roll out in the open and that is usually for either for drama's sake as we all watch the dice bounce across the table waiting for them to stop or on a roll that could mean the death of a character.  Usually we players roll in lieu of the DM.  Is he is thinking of a possible random encounter - then the table rolls.  How does the NPC react to our impassioned plea - the player rolls.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If the dice rolls don't <i>really</i> matter and serve only as nudges to a mostly-predetermined plot, I'm not going to invest that heavily in a game.</p></div></blockquote>\nI don't know where you get the idea of a "mostly-predetermined plot."  Could someone please explain to me how improv creative judgment = prefabricated plot.  Until this idea that just because a person is making judgment calls means player deprotaganization is happening then no one's ever going to understand Mythic Bricolage.  Perhaps this is where the idea of Improv Jazz is the better metaphor.  The DM, while holding a privileged position, is still just as much on stage creatively riffing in the NOW as the other players are.  He's not playing from sheet music nor is he forcing the other players to do so as well.<br/><br/>It's understandable that some people still think that the "DM makes the story and players play along" is the generalized understanding of role-play, but that was debunked as a Creative Agenda long ago.  It was even referenced as Zilch-play or Z-play.  But why people are so terrified of the idea of using creative judgment a priori is frustrating to me.\n<blockquote>...without a charismatic and talented GM, I am guessing this style of play falls to bits very quickly.</blockquote>\nHere you're absolutely right within the one half of the game you're pointing to - the GM.  The quality and quantity of fun also falls precipitously when even a small percentage of the <i>players</i> are not talented/skilled.  <i>Everyone</i> has to be good just like in a jazz ensemble.  One bad soloist really diminishes the listening experience.  Two can ruin the whole event.  I should note that "Good" is entirely locally defined.<br/><br/>Now onto Paul's earlier questions.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483103/#Comment_483103" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-10T03:55:46+00:00" title="May 10, 2019  3:55AM">May 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Unfortunately, without a charismatic and talented GM, I am guessing this style of play falls to bits very quickly.

However, the counterpoint is that a group of skilled players (guided by a charismatic GM) may be capable of achieving great things with this kind of ruleset. If we can show that what they can achieve is greater than, or at least meaningfully different from other styles of gaming, there could be some real value in developing our understanding of what's going on here.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483109/#Comment_483109" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-10T07:29:48+00:00" title="May 10, 2019  7:29AM">May 10</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2019 7:34AM by DeReel.">edited May 10</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excuse me for interjecting, I just want to make a side note that I see the 15 and 17 rolls described above like this : <br/>1 - a frame of "starting situation - effect expectations" like Blades in the dark formalises<br/>2 - plus DM reading the table vibes to adjust dramatic effect<br/>3 - a form of Fortune (encounter) roll with enough granularity that it makes room for this kind of subjectivity. This room for subjectivity being vital.<br/><br/>The playstyle doesn't handle well "impartial refereeing" and doesn't equip the players with tools to leverage "situation - effect".

I think these costs are easily accepted because the 3 points above may well be worth it (Negotiating 1 can be a pain).

(AFAIK, the players can also say they're making a move, but in a Mythic Bricolage-style of game, the GM wields more control.) In Mouseguard, the GM determines the difficulty of a roll by the applicable factors. In Fate, Aspects can adjust the difficulty of the roll. In BitD, position/effect are metrics for determining success and danger.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in your examples of Mythic Bricolage, it seems as though an undue number of mechanics reside within the GM's jurisprudence <i>and</i> are withheld from the players <i>and</i> vary based on the GM's whim. Contrast the barest mechanics of Pathfinder 2e:<br/><br/>1. DM sets the DC for a task.<br/>2. Player rolls d20 + modifiers.<br/>3. Success by +10 or a natural 20 is a critical (boosted effect). Failure by -10 or a natural 1 is a critical failure (something bad happens).<br/><br/>These are visible to me as a player. They're barebones, but they're visible. In the Mythic Bricolage, almost everything is concealed from the players, and moreover, you said:\n<blockquote>DM - "The sword just skitters across your chest cutting a hole in your shirt! That would have been your death."</blockquote>\nThere's no indication that the roll's failure would have resulted in additional damage, and so if the player had failed the roll, the the orc's attack would bypass the wound/hit point system in place and slain him outright. From an outsider's perspective, it appears the characters really have no control over their fates, and since both the difficulty of a roll and the consequences of a failed roll are unknown and controlled by the GM, the GM lacks guidelines and structure, and it seems quite likely that all success is only allowed by his good grace.<br/><br/>In short, the players have only the power he grants them, and thus any capacity to affect the narrative is a matter of his benevolence. All of these things, taken together, lead me to draw my conclusion:\n<blockquote>without a charismatic and talented GM, I am guessing this style of play falls to bits very quickly</blockquote>\nThe comment about plot pre-determination is because the plot exists and it is the GM's generosity that allows players to alter its course. The GM may be more or less generous as the situation demands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483150/#Comment_483150" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-10T21:04:48+00:00" title="May 10, 2019  9:04PM">May 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talking to <a href="/forums/profile/Jeph">@Jeph</a> about Sil's game today on reddit and I found a way to explain why I find the style so familiar;<br/><br/>I ran Everway for 20 years!

There's a picture of a farmer in a field hitting a snake with a hammer but the snake is revealed to be the tail of a mighty dragon. The DM decides that this card means that she'll say, at first: "A rat comes close..." and then when the player says "I lunge!" the DM goes on "You hit it, and it squirms around, but you've opened yourself up. Two other rats charge in..."<br/><br/>Looking up this card in the rule book says "The card has links to all four elements: the hoe suggests earth, the moon suggests water, and the dragon's wings and red eyes suggest air and fire. This card represents a failure and a danger on all levels, physical, mental, and spiritual".<br/><br/>This is mythic bricolage in action, Jeph! I've gamemastered a ton of Everway!<br/><br/>The GM in Everway is instructed to choose completely freely between "drama" (do what makes sense for the story, present interesting choices, provide "bangs" [ideas for bangs are generated in character creation as well]) and "karma" (follow the flow of action as seems obvious to you; a weak fighter being defeated by a strong fighter; a key found in the box where it belongs) and "fortune" (interpret the abstract images and horoscope signs and elements and deities depicted on the cards in the fortune deck and turn that into adjucation). The DM can do 100% drama and that's within the rules, she can do 100% fortune and that's within the rules etc.<br/><br/>This was my gaming for twenty years!

I find it very hard to imagine that happening at all.<br/><br/>It's true that rolling that often and taking into account the 1s and 20s might make a very *subtle* difference, but it's complicated by a number of factors: first of all, the scope of any roll is entirely undefined, so the GM can still interpret the rolls as being inconsequential in the larger scheme of things (and does, in my experience), second, the 1s and 20s happen often enough that they can "cancel each other out" (a natural 20 might be counterbalanced by three following low rolls, for instance, even if there isn't a natural 1), and there doesn't seem to be any standard at all about what gets rolled for and what doesn't (including long stretches of play where no dice are rolled at all).<br/><br/>You can even see instances of this in the fight example, above. Reading that example, do you find that you can assume anything about the outcome of a rolled result before the GM announces it?<br/><br/>Jay, do speak up and let us know, though! *Do* you ever call Cary to task for failing to call for a roll, or the way he interprets it?

Maybe add your mod when checking vs that 7/8 border (in which case raise it, so that a typical character needs around 8 to make it. 12 or 13 is good if +4 or +5 bonuses are common).<br/><br/>You get the same sorta benefit that you can get in a really intense PbtA fight; you already know what the dice mean and you can read them instantly.

Interestingly, the style of the GM's response changes as well: through most of the exchange, the GM's responses are even more in-world than the player's, now we're suddenly talking pluses, to the precision of "don't forget the +1"!<br/><br/>So what do these special steps and calculations accomplish?<br/><br/>Player - "18!"<br/>DM - "Roll percentile and double your damage roll."<br/>Player - "45 on the percentile and 8 plus 2...uh....doubled...20 points!"<br/>DM - "You crush him in the back. He stumbles to a knee but gets back up.<br/><br/>Apparently, nothing? It still results in the GM saying what happens, led by his best judgment, faithfulness to the vision of the setting, and so on, exactly as usual.<br/><br/>If you wanted to design a game from scratch meant to be played like Silmenume's, wouldn't it be cleaner and more elegant to just use the usual d20 low is bad high is good roll in this place? Wouldn't it be more conducive to imagination and subjectivity to draw and interpret an Everway card after an impassioned description of how much you throw yourself into the blow, instead of talking about full smotes for +6, and don't forget the +1?<br/><br/>But I think the thing is, nobody sat down and with conscious intent designed Silmenume's game from scratch. It grew by accretion and historical accident and precedent specific to this group.<br/><br/>Including full smotes for numerical modifiers into this game might be bad engineering, but as bricolage it is what it is, and it's value and weight is in all those associations to previous times somebody declared "full smote!" and achieved something spectacular, or failed miserably. "Add the +1" might not make a difference in the sense that even if the GM is somewhat constrained by high or low numbers, he certainly doesn't appear to be constrained to the precision of a difference between 17 and 18: but as a ritual phrase, it's an acknowledgment of your full smote, lending it equal weight as all those full smotes the we remember that got to add the +1.<br/><br/>I'm not sure it's even possible to replicate that in design, or if going after it intentionally dispels the "magic".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483191/#Comment_483191" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-11T10:20:17+00:00" title="May 11, 2019 10:20AM">May 11</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2019 10:33AM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited May 11</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just scanning this thread because it is flying along too fast, but I have noticed one thing.

The challenge with this playstyle I keep coming back to is that it's very difficult to determine which elements are supportive/fundamental to the playstyle, and which are a quirk of your group's "house rules" and Cary's personal preferences, as well as a history of being "based in D&amp;D" to whatever extent.</p></div></blockquote>\nTo be perfectly honest, so am I...<br/><br/>EDIT - after writing this post and further consideration of your question I've come to a tentative conclusion that there is no distinction between the various items you've listed as far as Bricolage is concerned.  IOW <i>all</i> the above is available for bricolage.  Every gaming group is going to bricole its own unique system of play over time as a natural consequence of bricolage centered play.<br/><br/>However that our game has a history of of being "based in D&amp;D" is a great starting point to support my argument of the Mythic Bricolage process.  "D&amp;D" acts as the role of the "concrete" items (the physical things of the world) that the myth maker uses as a starting place.  He started his role-play career with D&amp;D and loved it immediately but quickly grew frustrated with the concepts of play.  He felt straight jacketed in his freedom to role-play by the mechanics and felt that many of them were outright silly.  So he bided his time watching the other players to see what they responded positively to and what they didn't like.  Then he set about creating a game experience that he felt the players would like and that he most certainly would like to play in if he wasn't the DM.  The process was one of using the familiar forms of the D&amp;D system but completely revamping through time and play.  IOW he bricoled as new system.  But most importantly he understood that he wanted to create a gaming experience that was intense and exciting.  This meant that the experience of play must triumph over mechanics.  He didn't come to this as a designer but through long play and hacking away some much system that he later finally realized what he had been doing instinctively.  And while the system was born out of the pieces of D&amp;D the form and meaning of the pieces was strongly influenced by LOTR.<br/><br/>Consider this - a game designer can Engineer a game system.  However once Exploration begins that System is now part of all the objects of Setting that can be subject to bricolage.  It is no longer objective truth but part of the meaning creation and information delivery process.  The game system is not treated as reified during play, it is a "thing" that can be used \n<blockquote>I struggled with the idea that ability scores, levels, and other "objective" scores were included in this at all. Earlier in one of these threads I mentioned that you could throw out Strength scores and such and still be playing the same game (perhaps even one that's all the more in line with the Semiotic Jazz idea), and you corrected me, saying I'd misunderstood.</blockquote>\nIf you could link back to that exchange or quote it if it's small enough I would be deeply appreciative.  I'm going to take a stab at this even though I can't remember the conversation itself.  Understand that my response to the aforementioned conversation is completely speculative.  <br/><br/>One definitely could play a SJ (Mythic Bricolage) game without scores, levels and what not specifically but there definitely needs to be some starting point.  Like myth some sort of "physical reality" (and I admit said "physical reality" can take <i>many</i> forms) must first be present so that the bricoleur has a prestocked tool shed to start with.  Such a game would have a different flavor and will result in a different experience but the process of play - Mythic Bricolage - would be identical.  Words (as opposed to numbers) are the medium of how preliterate tribal societies create myth.  We happen to use words that include the subset of words called "numbers."<br/><br/>Again - the key is Exploration.  Once we've started Exploration ability scores, levels and what not stop being treated as "Objective Values" and become "Bricoled Meaning Structures."  Outside of Exploration "level" might mean you've rolled up your character's Stamina/Weapon Skill/Defense Percentage so many times but once we've entered Exploration and shifted gears to Mythic Bricolage through some ritualised process those values are now meaning structures which can change and grow through play.  Level "10" means, among all sorts of meanings that have accrued as one has play, that said character is extremely accomplished, has seen a lot danger, travelled much of the world, has a presence about him, likely has some notoriety, etc.  A Character with "11th lvl Tracking" might be sought after by those in the know in times of need because of said PC's long history of finding whatever the character's been looking for.  Perhaps even some (in)famous NPC's.\n<blockquote>How, then, can you justify the inclusion of things like Strength scores (an extremely "Western Engineering" kind of tool and concept) as anything but a vestigial throwback to D&amp;D?<br/><br/>If "[...] Mythic Bricolage (SJ) is supremely subjective that means any information the GM gives out about Setting will also be delivered in a way that is subjective and open to interpretation...", why do we suddenly change that approach and attitude when it comes to game statistics?<br/><br/>Shouldn't my "Strength score" (or character level, or attack bonus) also be "delivered in a way that is subjective and open to interpretation"?</blockquote>\nLet me ask you a quick question in return.  Have I ever indicated what a given "Strength score" means?  Either the value or the phrase itself?  I know I haven't...that's because during Exploration in or out of the SIS it is <i>never</i> "objectively" defined.  Not does one say in game something like, "I have a STR of 17 so I can break down doors made of woods weaker than oak and less than 2 inches thick."  That's dragging an "Objective" meaning of the Strength of into the SIS and using it to direct by play by its own "Objective" defined mechanical value.  Rather a person with a "STR of 17" deduces through play that they can break through many light and some medium weight doors.  If that effort to break down a door fails the player then has to start using the abductive/inductive/deductive logic process to start figuring out why.  Limited to using <i>only</i> the clues provided by the SIS.  Such numbers are <i>constantly</i> open to interpretation as they are utterly subjective during Exploration.  Consider the reported cases of regular women lifting cars off of their children.  Granted it's a rather rare event but what might of been objectively quantified as a "13 Strength" for a few frantic moments exhibits the strength of an Ogre.  Does that mean her strength is truly/objectively as that matching an Ogre's?<br/><br/>(Continued in the next post...)<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483231/#Comment_483231" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T03:47:00+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  3:47AM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That is immensely subjective.

href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>\n<blockquote>...if I were designing this game from scratch, based on your description of play, I would never come up with this:<br/><br/>Beordan<br/>* Level 5 Fighter<br/>* XP Total 1,257<br/>* Strength 16<br/>* Attack Bonus +4</blockquote>\nAnd neither do we.  We start with a character concept which has its seed somewhere in Middle Earth or that part of the Setting which has been created through play.  Or maybe some new place that is plausible if we generate an interesting culture.  Then we roll up the character's Attributes and discuss his background (not in toto - that too is subject to growth in play).  Depending on what we decide upon about his culture and bg it may affect his Attributes and Skills and their values.<br/><br/>I have character in my folder that is a Dunedain.  Being of the race of the Dunedain earned me bonuses in to my raw numbers as they are a gifted people who have both Maia and Elven blood in their veins.  But then my back story includes a tale whereby I spent 70 years searching for my lost brother.  This bit of story influenced my skills in both types and values to <i>reflect</i> such a tremendous effort.  And while the Attribute numbers help me create a mental image of my character here are some events in my recent history that are far more important to me as a player.<br/><br/>Arwen was captured by some 300 Orcs as came seeking to bring Aid to a group of Dunedain who had nearly been overrun by Wights.  In the process of rescuing Arwen sole remaining scion of Elrond.  In the process I witnessed Meneltir, an Istari, engage in a fierce magical battle with a Nazgul.  At the near cost of my life I saved her from the grasping clutches of a Fell Beast.  During the battle I briefly engaged with some sort of shadowy "Black Spirit" whose barest touch slew without any "Hero's Saving Throw".  Touch = instant death.  Later I witnessed Arwen sing a song of such beauty and power that the local trees lit up as if by a Silver Flame.  As a measure of her gratitude she kissed me on the brow!!!  (As a player this will remain one of the most defining moments of my character).  I saw Great Eagles come to gather her and fly her to Imladris.  Later Meneltir gave me a purple stone (Purple is his color) so that at Great Need I could communicate with him telepathically.  Not long after I spotted 12 tall men all clad in black clothing running through Rohan.  I follow until the enter a copse of trees.  I try lighting a fire so I can try and burn them down but am spotted and am driven off by about 18 of these Black Numenoreans.  While near I telepathically hear a voice command these Black Numenoreans to find "it."  I also heard that they were hunting after Meneltir and had possession of this True Name.  This is <i>Very Bad</i>.  I use the stone to notify him as to my locution and he is greatly afeared and flees to Imladris seeking council.  I chose right to use the stone.  If I can find some time that isn't an emergency I would like to go to Imladris and seek a wife.<br/><br/>This is but a small measure of "who I am."  I am not my numbers on the sheet.  I am the sum total of my decisions and experiences.  Yes numbers help us remember our relative and subjective skill levels, especially in the heat of rapid battle, but they are not by any means "Who I Am" or "What I Can Do" in play.\n<blockquote>I would, rather, probably come up with something like:<br/><br/>Beordan<br/>* The greatest warrior of Bernholme, Rohan's northernmost outpost, a village with a garrison of 50 men-at-arms.<br/>* Fought for three years against overwhelming numbers of Uruk-hai, and once defeated an Uruk-hai chieftain in single combat despite having an arrow lodged in his thigh.<br/>* Known for feats of Strength; in his whole life only a couple of Men have been able to wrestle him to the ground, although he is significantly shorter than one of the Dunedain, and has never tested his strength against anyone of that lineage. <br/>* Of his companions, only Berenai is more skilled with a sword, but Beordan is a poor archer because he broke his right index finger as a child, making it hard to grip arrows.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the latter is more useful, appropriate, and in line with the stated goals of the game.<br/><br/>Why do you feel confident (if you do) that these particular elements are useful to your game, or in line with the playstyle and creative agenda you're describing?</blockquote>\nIn a slower paced game the descriptions you offered above would work just fine.  At the speed we play when our speed as players is the speed our characters' reactions then the shorthand that we use is really, really <i>helpful</i>.  Yet, in the end, it is <i>our choices and actions</i> that form the character's life experiences that matter most.  We love our characters not because of their numbers but because of what we've done with them and what we've accomplished and what we've survived.  This emotional investment bleeds into Setting and reverberates back into our emotional investment into our characters.  It's a feedback loop.  Numbers can speed the play process along.<br/><br/>Recall that any values or numbers that exist on the character sheet do not map directly into nor have a objective, directive effect on the SIS.  They are employed, ultimately, in the service of helping create an emotionally involving and white knuckle intense <i>experience</i>.\n<blockquote>2. The example of combat is excellent! Based on what I know about your game, it looks so accurate as to make me wonder whether it's an actual transcript from a real game session. Would you be willing to discuss particular details in there, or are most of them a case of, "Well, I don't know - that's just how Cary does it"? (For instance, why in the world bring in skill checks/marks in the middle of a fight? That seems like odd timing, but it could be as simple as, "Cary just calls for these when they come to mind!")</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.  Ask away.\n<blockquote>3. I keep coming back to the issue of whether what you're discussing in this playstyle is a) thoroughly integrated to the techniques being used in the game (perhaps a form of Technical Agenda - "we're used to playing this way"), b) a fundamental question of the creative agenda ("why are we playing this; what are we trying to do?") at work, or c) a perfect cohesive unit of the two working together (which is how you are presenting this, if I understand you correctly).</blockquote>\na)  Does not or can not an Improv Jazz soloist have a recognizable style?<br/><br/>b)  This is akin to asking why a musician has chosen to become an Improv Jazz player as opposed to playing in a symphony orchestra or a string quartet.<br/><br/>c)  I don't know if its a "perfect" cohesive whole but it definitely is a combination of 'a' and 'b'.<br/><br/>Every game group that prioritizes Mythic Bricolage as the mode of play will, in the fullness of time, end up with a unique and different method of play.

Forgive me for being sensitive on this particular word usage as it has already come in this thread as someone complaining about railroading.  There is no desired "story" but rather the desire to create an intense gaming "experience".  Very, very different.  A desired <i>story</i> is an abstract concept while a gaming <i>experience</i> is definitionally subjective.

Good stuff here. I'll note for myself that I used the term "story" to refer to Eero's game, which is heavily based on an existing story as well as a setting. So don't worry about that! (Although I'm still fairly skeptical about the idea that there is "no desired story" in your game, as well. That would be pretty hard to prove either way, however, because of the almost total control a single person has over all outcomes and developments.)<br/><br/>Your music analogies, as usually, have lost me. Probably best not to pursue it further, because I have no idea how the analogy of "joining a symphony orchestra" helps explain whether a certain game experience is unique because of its technical details or the underlying psychological motivation for playing in the first place.\\<br/><br/>Now:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>At the speed we play when our speed as players is the speed our characters' reactions then the shorthand that we use is really, really <i>helpful</i>.

Wouldn't that be better served by some non-random means of assigning attributes?

The idea that it's up to the players through their experience via the SIS to make sense of the world.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Player - "I swing."<br/>DM - "Roll."<br/>Player - "10...plus 5...15 total!"<br/>Not a bad roll.  That's what would traditionally be an AC 5 hit in a deterministic resolution system.  Rather in Mythic Bricolage this is a starting point for interpretation for DM and player.<br/>DM - "He knocks your sword aside.  Your sword is way out of position as he thrusts at you. Roll."</p></div></blockquote>\nHere's the first hint/clue about the Orc.  Not only does the player fail to hit the Orc with a reasonable roll total the Orc parried the players swing in such a way as to render the PC's weapon useless for a few moments.  Then the DM reports that the Orc also had skill enough to quickly turn his parry into an attack.  This Orc is no cannon fodder but something much more dangerous.\n<blockquote>Player - "Oh crap!  Avoid!  I spin away! ... uh...Natural 17!"<br/>DM - "The sword just skitters across your chest cutting a hole in your shirt!  That would have been your death."</blockquote>\nThat the DM commented about the potential lethality of the Orc attack is another hint that this Orc is bad news.  Why?  Typically a single orc blow isn't particularly lethal especially at the beginning of a combat especially if the PC has a couple of levels.  Again it's up to player to start putting the hints together if they are paying attention.\n<blockquote>Player - "I try and trap his arm and break his elbow!"<br/>DM - "Dangerous. Dangerous. Add your hand to hand.  Don't roll poorly..."</blockquote>\nThe "Dangerous. Dangerous." isn't just a dramatic flourish.  The DM is communicating to the Player again something about his Orcish foe.  The same is true for the "Don't roll poorly..." admonition.  Yes this adds drama and it is supposed to rattle the player but it carries real important information.\n<blockquote>Player - "uh....12....plus 6....18!"<br/>DM - "You're in position...roll to hit."<br/>Player - "Weapon or hand to hand?"<br/>DM - "Hand to hand...Roll a natural 18, 19, or 20 and you break his arm outright"<br/>Player - "Oh man! 17 total!"<br/>DM - "Roll D4 for damage."<br/>Player - "2...add Str Damage?"<br/>DM - nods<br/>Player - "4 total!"<br/>DM - grunts, "The arm doesn't yield.  He spins to face you and you see his gauntleted fist coming straight at your face."</blockquote>\nTwo hints in here.  First the Orc doesn't waste time trying to break the hold his arm even after the PC's failed attempt to break it.  Rather the Orc keeps his head and hoping the player continues to be wrapped up in the process of doing something to his arm the Orc maneuvers to attack the distracted PC.  Not a typical behavior for a basic Orc.  The second hint is that this Orc is wearing gauntlets.  Orc's don't wear gauntlets...usually.  Is this an Orc captain?  An Orc hero?\n<blockquote>DM - "Roll percentile and double your damage roll."<br/>Player - "45 on the percentile and 8 plus 2...uh....doubled...20 points!"<br/>DM - "You crush him in the back.  He stumbles to a knee but gets back up..."</blockquote>\nHere we see the Orc take a blow hard enough to drive him down to his knee.  The hint here is that the Orc gets up right away.  The wind isn't knocked out of him.  He isn't stunned or staggered beyond the moment he lost his balance and went to his knee for a moment.  Ok - this is one bad Orc - if the player has synthesized the available information into a reasonable abduction!\n<blockquote>DM - "...Roll a 20."<br/>Player - "What do I add?"<br/>DM - "Just roll..."<br/>Player - "16!"<br/>DM - "Put a check down for sight.  You see that under his shirt you can now see broken chain links and blood.  Put a check down for perception.  You also note that you should have killed him but he's turning to face you with a snarl."</blockquote>\nWe now have the data points that not only has the Orc taken a strong hit on his back but that his morale isn't broken in the least.  Definitely bad news.  To drive the point home the DM gives the player a check in Sight and Perception.  Why?  The player didn't roll a '1', '10', or '20'.  Its to drive home the point that what the PC is seeing and perceiving is <i>Important</i>!  Important enough that the PC learned something about the use of those skills in a fight.  Hint! Hint! Hint!<br/><br/>This whole process of using norms and hints to logic out what is going on in the SIS is central to the play process.  We "experience" things and from our "experiences" we synthesize a reality.  Just like in real life.  So employing the same "How does this work" logic process in game that we use in real life really functions to shift one's sense of the world to the fictional world.  The more frequently we have to do it the most vibrant that experiential shift.  And that's what we're after.<br/><br/>Now I'll get on with the rest of the questions...<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483287/#Comment_483287" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T00:20:38+00:00" title="May 13, 2019 12:20AM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" rel="nofollow">Silmenume</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>To drive the point home the DM gives the player a check in Sight and Perception.

Or is it a reward for rolling that final '16'?</blockquote>\nBecause the DM used those particular skills to convey information to the player as Important Now it buttresses the idea of skill growth.  IOW the PC's sight didn't get better (as in changing visual acuity) but rather his ability to pick details out of a noisy background improved.  Like the way Anti-Aircraft gunners were trained to discern enemy from friendly aircraft in WWII.  The resolving power of their eyes didn't improve but rather the speed at which their visual system's to discern friend from foe based on silhouettes got faster and more reliable.  That kind of process.<br/><br/>This is part of the growth process that makes higher level characters more formidable than lower level characters.  The events justified the growth opportunity that the DM employed.<br/><br/>Forgive me my responses.  I'm burnt out.  If you want more of an answer let me know.  Now we're beginning to delve into aesthetic issues of play.\n<blockquote>Forgive me from what is probably an old question, but why is rolling a '10' significant? That's new to me.</blockquote>\nWhile I've been focusing strongly on how the fortune mechanics are non-deterministic I never got around to explaining that "10's" can get you checks in skills even if the check fails on a "10".  Usually when a check is awarded another opportunity is afforded to pass the skill check.  So the saying goes at the table - Always let the DM know when you roll a natural 1, 10 or 20.  The whole thing is a lesser detail that wasn't particularly instructive regarding discussing the nature of the CA.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483297/#Comment_483297" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T04:15:54+00:00" title="May 13, 2019  4:15AM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good answers, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483330/#Comment_483330" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T19:20:46+00:00" title="May 13, 2019  7:20PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a>,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do sometimes the results interpreted by the DM create slight dissonances with your expectations (by 1 or 2 points), like a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23sharp&amp;Mode=like">#sharp</a> ?

We might have expectations but we don't have guarantees because we are playing a game of perceptions and we know just how flawed those can be.  But for the most post most of the machine works on "good enough" again because we are playing a game of perceptions.  There can be lots of reasons why expectations do meet perceptions so the game is a usually a bit fuzzy - just like life.<br/><br/>I'll give an example from real life.  My sister has been a law officer in a major metropolitan police for over 30 years.  Given the same calibre weapon and injury location a police officer is much more likely do die from the same gunshot wound than a gangbanger.  It's such a well known phenomena that there is a joke in the police circles that when an officer gets a paper cut to call 911.  My point is that in circumstances that are as identical as can reasonably be we can't predict with certitude what the outcome will be.  We just don't have objective surety that our efforts will work out exactly as desired.  Yes the general effects were the same but the specifics were different.  Life is a bit fuzzy.  Why should the game be any different?  Yes, on the whole, there should/must be "typical" behaviors but they should be "gaussian."  I find it jarring and artificial if they became "exact" behaviors.   \n<blockquote>Or something else : the resolution mechanic changes with the game play. In which case, it's an infinite game with an unnecesseraily high entry barrier.</blockquote>\nI think the real problem to understanding all this is that "resolution" mechanic is uncritically tied to the notion that said mechanics are deterministic.  If, as I've been proposing, that role of the GM is specifically <i>not</i> to be the impartial adjudicator who stands out and above the CA but whose role it is to facilitate Bricolage then we get a whole different understanding of what "resolution mechanics" means WRT to this CA.  In this instance we are much much closer to the Lumpley Principle in its rawest form.  This also means that the GM is very much intimately involved in the play process.  One cannot bricole at a remove (at least not very effectively) from the "pieces" rather one best Bricoles if one is intimately immeshed in the process.  The difference is that the GM has the addition responsibilities of making sure that the Setting operates appropriately and introducing new elements into the Setting (all the constituent parts of same).  But then what constrains the GM's input?  The Setting, of course.  That and the style in which the game is being played.  Epic heroic, reserved and contemplative, etc.<br/><br/>So yes the "resolution mechanic" which in this case is Bricolage does change depending on many factors but its not capricious.  It follows the logic of the Setting.  So there will be gaussian distribution of outputs which helps normalize the game but there can still be an "infinite" number of outcomes.  Those however should/ought to be something like 2 or three standard deviations out.  This "infinitude" of possibilities does not create a high entry barrier to play.  We've playing short sessions a game store recently looking for new players.  Typically the new player will be rolled up quickly given a back story that ties him/her into the scenario and given a quick run down of the basics.  No rules books.  Look at the situation - what do you do?<br/><br/>Yes play slows way down and for the rest of us the intensity falls but that is understood when we do this.  What typically happens for the new player is that their mind is blown while to the experienced players to game was very mild.  The point is that with no "rules books" and minimal instruction (about 10 minutes worth) a new player can and frequently does have an amazing gaming experience - bricoling.  Even though the players don't know what bricolage is they very quickly intuit the process.  Some are better than others but it comes very naturally because of primacy of the SIS (Setting) above deterministic mechanics.  Fuzzy outcomes are just fine most of the time.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483336/#Comment_483336" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-13T20:08:37+00:00" title="May 13, 2019  8:08PM">May 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2019 8:18PM by DeReel.">edited May 13</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand the fuzzy resolution and agree it's not unreasonable. <br/>The high barrier for entry I see lies in the code. Maybe most of the first time players have experienced D&amp;D and know Tolkien but if not, the bits of them in your table code must seem strange. But maybe being in a game store gets you just the right persons. For me, playing with children, I'd declare right from the start : this is an infinite game, we are making up a story as we go and coming up with the rules along the way. Then we'd build a common setting. I think you do that with D&amp;D &amp; Tolkien as a common. And maybe for those who don't know these references, the hospitality of your group and the creative freedom of an infinite game is all they need to get high. <br/>Thank you for your patience.

I agree with you fully that is "sounds" just as you described but that's from the hermeneutic assumption of Western thinking.  The game functions with the hermeneutic foundation of Myth Bricolage.  Thus to us players the call for a "full smote" carries much more than the Western mechanical meaning.  For us it means I (the character) am putting everything I've got into full bodied overhead swinging blow to try and kill this thing with extreme prejudice.  Also note that by this point we are bellowing our actions so we a fully emotionally committed to what we are attempting to do.  Finally our combat is almost always physically mimed so while we're bellowing out our actions we are acting them out as forcefully as we can demonstrate.  That small phrase is a direct, short and sharp communication to the DM that mirrors our mimed action to confirm he understands what we are showing him we are doing.  That the communication is short and quick helps keep us "immersed" as much as possible - as it were.\n<blockquote>Interestingly, the style of the GM's response changes as well: through most of the exchange, the GM's responses are even more in-world than the player's, now we're suddenly talking pluses, to the precision of "don't forget the +1"!</blockquote>\nThe DM saying "don't forget the +1" is both communicative and ritualistic.  Because the player didn't include it in his die roll the DM is saying "I'm watching out for you."  Also the DM is saying "I heard you and I understand what you're attempting."  Ritually the DM is capping off the proposed action ritually by calling to mind the "+1".  Mechanically the +1 is fairly trivial, meaning wise its extremely important.\n<blockquote>So what do these special steps and calculations accomplish?<br/><br/>Player - "18!"<br/>DM - "Roll percentile and double your damage roll."<br/>Player - "45 on the percentile and 8 plus 2...uh....doubled...20 points!"<br/>DM - "You crush him in the back. He stumbles to a knee but gets back up.<br/><br/>Apparently, nothing? It still results in the GM saying what happens, led by his best judgment, faithfulness to the vision of the setting, and so on, exactly as usual.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be more conducive to imagination and subjectivity to draw and interpret an Everway card after an impassioned description of how much you throw yourself into the blow, instead of talking about full smotes for +6, and don't forget the +1?</blockquote>\nAgain, you're missing the point.  This isn't a task resolution process nor or the words employed in the Western abstract sense but rather in the Mythic Bricolage sense with all the weight and freight they bring with them.  This is all a communication process.  It's also a dramatic moment and by calling for all these events we're ritualizing the moment.  All these "mechanical" words are not interpreted in the Western Abstract mode but are instead word based meaning structures that are dripping with meaning in the SIS.  It is immensely exciting as a player to put the smack down on an Orc...but lo a quick reversal as it isn't destroyed!  The emotional whiplash is powerful and that's part of the point of play.  To feel intense emotions.  To do mighty deeds.<br/><br/>Will Mythic Bricolage do this automatically?  No.  Is it a good tool for it?  Absolutely.  Bricolage is a neutral value problem solving technique.  We work hard and consistently to imbue the process with a style we enjoy as players.  Just so you get just how emotionally charged these combats get the moment the DM starts to play a piece of music commonly associate with combat we all stand up from the table immediately in combat poses.  Frequently good bump appear and I know that my heart starts racing.  I've been told the other players have similar physiological reactions.  If that isn't impassioned I don't know know what is.<br/><br/>Actually, just as in true preliterate myth, one can set out to try and accomplish some specific goal, it's just the process of putting the myth together though bricolage leads to all sorts of entailments.  ...and the result is intensely personal, supremely subjective and constantly open to revision or reused as part of another myth.  They do it make sense of their world and give it stability and meaning.  We use the same process to create subjective consistency, meaning and emotionally compelling events.  Same process two different goals.\n<blockquote>I'm not sure it's even possible to replicate that in design, or if going after it intentionally dispels the "magic".</blockquote>\nWith some provisos - I would agree.  See, one could <i>start</i> with an "Engineered" or "Designed" system but it must be treating not as a fixed "Objective" thing above the SIS but rather as just another piece of grist for the bricolage process.  The thing to remember in all of this is that whatever is employed as Setting which includes Mechanics which ought to be reflective of Setting and/or Color will flavor the game.  Any mechanics that are in game at bottom are a reflection of Setting and in turn as the game progresses and Setting changes then so will the mechanics.

Just because the GM is not <i>impartial</i> does not equate to player deprotagonization.  Let's look at another game that without having to read a single word of its system is expected to be extremely limited in player protagonization.  D&amp;D5e's Adventure League's books of linked adventures.  In order for the linking to work the PCs are required to have succeeded (or failed) in the previous module so that the <i>necessary</i> conditions that are required for the beginning of the next adventure are fulfilled.  Illusionism or Participationism you still end up in the same place WRT protagonization - null value player choices.  In Narrativist play such deprotagonized play was labeled "Typhoid Mary."<br/><br/>The point being is that Resolution Mechanics have no ontological existence - they cannot enforce themselves or muscle their way in the SIS of their own will.  Players are always making judgments calls as to whether or not a mechanic applies and how to state its effect on the SIS.  All role-play is a judgment call and that idea is encapsulated in the Lumpley Principle.  There can never be an absolutely unbiased employment of System - even in RAW games.  By definition People are involved in role-playing games so they will always be involved in System.<br/><br/>Players enforce System, not the other way around.  <br/><br/>So the question becomes is the primary role of Resolution Mechanics to remove the human judgment from System?  If that is the case then one is then left with the question, "Why role-play at all" and play a choose-your-own-adventure-book, a MMORPG, et.al., instead?  Let us continue and assume that for the sake of argument we want to play an RPG as defined by the definition of Exploration and that is what we're discussing.  But the question still needs be addressed - is the primary role of system to prevent protagonization?  I would argue, no.  I would posit in Gamist play the mechanics are the equivalent of rules of chess - they define what is and isn't <i>relevant/allowable</i> play.  This informs what form Address of Challenge will take in the broadest sense.  The same holds true for Address of Premise.  The thing I see as getting everyone's underwear all bunched up about the idea of using Mythic Bricolage as System is that they believe, falsely in my opinion, that the primary role of Resolution Mechanics is to drive the human judgement factor completely out of System - especially combat mechanics.  Which, to my way of thinking, is kinda strange given the boundless potential of the human imagination combined with the fact that we are indeed playing an RPG with everything that entails.<br/><br/>Ok.  Player deprotagonziation happens and unless the players are playing in a Participationist mode it sux.  Furthermore I will agree that people think Mythic Bricolage is "opaque" given the misperception of the role of Resolution Mechanics.  I will go one step further by agreeing that because most people don't even know <i>how</i> Mythic Bricolage works it is frequently misused leaving the GM to fall back on the oldest paradigm in RPG - the GM created and told "Story".  But that's now how Mythic Bricolage works.  As I indicated above about how resolution mechanics shapes how the game is played it also shapes player <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">expectations</span></i> about how said game is "supposed to be played." <br/><br/>People look at Resolution Mechanics and believe their role is to enforce impartiality.  Not only is that not so but it is an impossibility.  Mythic Bricolage as System cannot be impartial as the creative human element is not only baked in but it is prioritized.  (<i>This is not meant to imply</i> that the G/N CA's are not creative endeavours).  Bricolage solves problems while creating entailments.  Myth creates subjective human meaning through <i>structure</i>.<br/><br/>Tribal cultures use Myth to make sense/meaning to deal with the opaqueness of life.  To create order out of chaos.  To show that what was thought to be previously unknown was already actually very knowable within the culture's meaning structure - Myth.  So when this process is mapped to RPG's (Exploration) we get some very, very different roles for the Elements of Exploration.  The Player's themselves are in an important sense thrust into the position of the tribesman but within the framework of RPG's.  Everything in the game is like unto the physical world subject to interpretation and Myth.  The players are just as blind to the future as a tribesman.  The world is just as opaque until it gains <i>meaning</i> when the humans account for some event through Mythic Bricolage.  In an RPG setting it is the GM who stands in for the mysterious physical world.  Yet for that mystery the tribesman see (or desire to see) structure, however hazily, and create a method of understanding to regularize the underlying structure and imbue it with purpose/meaning.  In Mythic Bricolage the GM must straddle the line between the (as yet) unaccountable and that which is regular and understood of the world.<br/><br/>To key to making this work in a Mythic Bricolage prioritized CA is that the GM must understand these two important elements.  The players are not privy to information that is not part of the SIS/universe and it is up to the players to create that order while  the GM is bound in his <i>representation</i> of the world - both in its predictability and unpredictability.  What is different from what the tribesman are trying to do as opposed to the GM in an RPG is that the GM is employing Mythic Bricolage to a stylistic end.  The tribesman is trying to create a (subjective) understanding of <i>everything</i> about the physical world.  The GM through the Elements of Exploration is trying to create a universe that can potentially be understood subjectively - but with a stylistic POV.  Is the experiential moment exciting, terrifying, sad, joyous, frustrating, hopeless, triumphant?<br/><br/><b>End part 1 of 2 - </b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483511/#Comment_483511" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T05:12:30+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  5:12AM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2019 5:30AM by Silmenume.">edited May 18</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Begin part 2 of 2 -</b><br/><br/>Yes there can be player deprotagonization but that has very little to do with how <i>explicit/transparent</i> the Resolution Mechanics are.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In the Mythic Bricolage, almost everything is concealed from the players, and moreover, you said:<br/><br/></p><blockquote>DM - "The sword just skitters across your chest cutting a hole in your shirt!

(And who cares what an outsider "thinks" as they are not part of the game experience?  Only the players' <i>experience</i> is what is relevant.)  The idea of an "outsider's perspective" (which I'm reading as an "Objective POV" - which given the human condition does not stand as that which is run through the senses is most emphatically <i>not objective</i>) stands in direct opposition to the Mythic Bricolage headspace.  Once play has begun and entered its ritual space we attempt to dismiss the idea of "Objective Truth" as that framework is utterly orthogonal to the "Subjectivity" of Myth.\n<blockquote>...the consequences of a failed roll are unknown...  </blockquote>\nNor should they.  Pull the trigger on a gun.  Will you know ahead of time if you're going to hit your target in real life?  Do you know beforehand that the round will misfire?  Will the round explode in the receiver?

Not having absolute knowledge or foreknowledge is a huge part of that danger and the attendant emotional subjective experience.\n<blockquote>...the GM lacks guidelines and structure...</blockquote>\nWhat?  I am completely at sea by this assertion.  Mythic Bricolage is <i><b>all about structure</b></i> and meaning.  I must have said this at least 30 - 40 times in my posts.  I get that understanding Mythic Bricolage is difficult to grok, but if there's anything that I've mentioned many times is that it is meaning creation process via structure.  Definitionally one cannot have myth(ic Bricolage) without normative structure.  Not narrative structure but the structure of bricoled meaning structures.  Perhaps I haven't stated this as such but it is implied in the statement that as myth creates stability of life it follows that <i>myth is normative</i>.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483514/#Comment_483514" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T05:45:51+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  5:45AM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2019 5:11AM by Silmenume.">edited May 18</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,\n<blockquote>Jay, do speak up and let us know, though! *Do* you ever call Cary to task for failing to call for a roll, or the way he interprets it?

He has a cowl pulled over head obscuring most of his face from view.  His clothing is travel stained and worn, but in appear in good repair.  You can't see his eyes but you can almost feel his regard upon you as a physical weight."<br/>Player - "...uh...do I sense any danger coming from him?"<br/><br/>We have a pair of skills that might apply to this situation.  Intuition and Perception.  Using a "ritualized form of game speak" the player is asking for roll against either or both skills.  Which can be influence by the player by saying - <br/><br/>GM - "You see a man sitting in a shadowy corner of the pub.  He has a cowl pulled over head obscuring most of his face from view.  His clothing is travel stained and worn, but in appear in good repair.

The "see if I can pick up anything about the cloaked man" is coded talk directed at the GM asking for a roll against Intuition or Perception.  The act of positioning the PC in such a way in the SIS is a way of attempting to learn more than a quick glance might get.<br/><br/>WRT - "...[questioning] the way [the GM] interprets [a roll]."<br/><br/>I'll have to think on that.  I'm so close to the game that I can't think of anything at the moment.

There are occasions where there are misunderstandings about the nature of the question we're asking about which really boils down to a clarification of intent on the player's part to the GM.<br/><br/>On rare occasions there are matters of factual error that needs to addressed and possibly retconned which can lead to a roll.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483516/#Comment_483516" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T05:59:26+00:00" title="May 16, 2019  5:59AM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jay,<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure, from that lost post, that the answer to my question is "no".

Actually we have a considerable over what our character can <i>attempt to do</i> (just like in real life) and this is part of the "infinite" of the game lies.  It's not constrained by mechanics but it is constrained by the normative nature of the SIS plus how clever a bricoleur one is.  Where we have much less control over is how the world responds to our actions (just like in real life.)<br/><br/>This requires us to be deeply invested at all times for both reasons.  Our choice of actions is dependent on our skills of bricoleurs which is not easy while we must be ready to react on a instant's notice to contend with whatever the world in its great infinitude might respond (also constrained by the normative nature/role of the SIS).<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483559/#Comment_483559" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-16T22:38:23+00:00" title="May 16, 2019 10:38PM">May 16</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that the description above is ignoring the role of the DM, and from the all the descriptions of your group's play style together, that role is massive.<br/><br/>You talk about the SIS, and "the world", and how they respond, but those aren't things in themselves, they are shared creations of all the players, including the DM, and the DM's input has a lot more weight than any given player's.

It might even help in understanding if the group itself ( or members) couldn't articulate it.<br/><br/>Forget the GNS categories in this btw. Whatever words you're using, look for the group, collective, consistent fun, regardless of what you label that fun.<br/><br/>In the case of these games, while Silmenume has talked extensively about their fun, labelling it Mythic Bricolage, several people have been noting that it is a game with very heavy and constant GM involvement.<br/><br/>I would suggest that examining Cary's ( the GM, right?) personal reward cycle separated out might tell you a ton about this game. What I expect you'll find is that there are two compatible but separate reward cycles going on here.<br/><br/>I also suspect that you'd find something similar going on in similarly long-running campaigns in this pretty traditional, post gamist game style.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483630/#Comment_483630" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-17T18:04:24+00:00" title="May 17, 2019  6:04PM">May 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My sincerest apologies to <a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">@ValyrianSteelKatana</a> if I came off rude or dismissive.

What I expect you'll find is that there are two compatible but separate reward cycles going on here.</p></div></blockquote>\nWe have a bunch of reward systems that the GM employs.<br/><br/>First we have "Wisdom Checks."  These are award for "good/clever/interesting" roleplay of character.  These are applied to our Experience total and are a requirement to go up levels.  IOW its not enough to be a murder hobo and rack up XP's.  To go up a level one needs 10x the level your character is going up to satisfy the requirement.  Going to 5th level requires "Wisdom Checks."<br/><br/>Player rating are given our at the end of evening.  For the same reasons listed above but this accounts for the whole evening's play.  This is takes the form of a number between 1 and 100 written in a circle.  This represents a discount of the total XP to go up a level.  So if at the end of the night you get a 30 in a circle that represents 30% of the XP needed to go up to the next level.<br/><br/>Excellent or creative use of a "secondary skill" can get checks awarded to that skill.  The skill goes up if you have the number of checks as the level you're going to.  FREX - it takes 6 checks to go from a 5th level skill rank to 6th.<br/><br/>Roleplaying something so exceptionally can earn you a new Secondary Skill and a ranking in the said skill.<br/><br/>At the end of the night the "Best Roleplayer" is awarded a physical small star.   Accumulation of amounts of 25, 50, 75, 100 result in certain in game resources becoming available for 10 of one's characters in a their folder.  I'd don't recall what they are at the moment.<br/><br/>Those are the more "Mechanical" rewards that I can recall off the top of the head.  Some of  the non mechanical rewards include such things as consideration for a special character - A Great Eagle, a Tree Ent, an Istari, a First Age Elf.<br/><br/>Getting a Dunedain is considered very special in that it is an indication that the player has is both a good roleplayer and has a very solid understanding of what the themes of the game are.  They are the iconic character of the struggle of ME in our game.<br/><br/>Designing proposing and having introduced a "new" character type into play is very rewarding as a player.  I championed the idea of playing a Tower Guard which no one had done in 40+ years of play.  I thought it would be neat and came up with a whole grouping of skills and history of how one became one, etc.  Yes they were in the books but only in as bg characters.  Another character type another player came up with were Knight's Palantar who seek out the relics of Numenor and hold them in trust until the coming of the king.  That's always personally rewarding.<br/><br/>I know there's more in this second category put they are specialized or uniques so are hard to quantify.  I'll post more if I can recall them to mind.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483705/#Comment_483705" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T04:05:22+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  4:05AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I mean Cary's reward cycle, not the players' reward cycle.<br/><br/><br/>IOW, examine the GM's fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483707/#Comment_483707" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T05:20:30+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  5:20AM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doh!

Maybe Jay just really wants to steel doll the arguments against the game? I.e. instead of saying "no, our mechanics are not subordinate", he's saying "yes, they are subordinate but that's part of what makes it awesome" and that keeps tripping me up. And or it's some kinda misunderstanding and the mechanics are still directive <i>once they are engaged</i> but they follow from the fiction ["are subordinate to the fiction"]. Again, like PbtA.<br/><br/>There's been some moments (the axe throwing at druid bbeg goal post moving) that I have a hard time squaring with this take though, so it's always interesting to see more details emerge.<br/><br/>Those moments aside, according to my "take" here, the reward cycle for Cary would be just as play-to-find-out:y as any AW or bang-based game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483737/#Comment_483737" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T13:53:53+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  1:53PM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I was thinking something a bit different.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that Cary's <b>primary</b> goal here (NOT the only goal. Other goals still seem very important!) is <i>to be an entertainer</i>.<br/><br/>That seems to fit with the inconsistent mechanics usage more than anything else.<br/><br/>I would note that he seems to do this consistently successfully, and that the play group as a whole certainly seems to feel that way from what Jay reports, and that's rather important to the whole thing.<br/><br/>This isn't some degenerate cult of personality Viking Hat GM situation with gamer Stockholm syndrome or whatever.<br/><br/>So, my big take away from all of these discussions, analysis and so on: If you want this sort of play, and want it successful, openly allow and accept the GM's major role is to be entertainer and create a reward cycle for it mechanically.*<br/><br/>And, to me, ultimately that was what The Forge discussions were about. How do we take this thing that has evolved, is successful, but also remove vestigial mechanical and procedural cruft to make the thing both lean and easily explained? That way the next generation of users don't have to effectively re-create the wheel on their own to get our play group's playstyle, as it is right there in the manual.<br/><br/>* Yes, I know, GM-as-entertainer tends to be either glossed over to get to other bits of conversation or actively poo-pooed around these parts, but it sure looks like the heart of the matter here to me. In this case, I think <i>celebrate, teach, and encourage, but also identify it honestly</i> is a better path.<br/><br/><br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483752/#Comment_483752" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-19T19:45:56+00:00" title="May 19, 2019  7:45PM">May 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=12933.msg138539#msg138539" rel="nofollow">Yeah, this is the post that has the first mention of Cary's style &amp; aesthetics</a>.

You're absolutely right and I've never thought about it anymore than a fish "thinks" about water.  I just assumed it was absolutely foundational that at bottom all role-play was an entertainment process.  It never occured to me a person would choose to take on the mantle of GM unless they were looking to entertain or facilitate in their players entertainment.  I'm not saying that there aren't other reasons for GMing but that at the moment I'm at a loss.

Yet I'm at a loss why saying that a person, a GM, working hard to "entertain" his players could be construed in some way as a "bad thing".  I'm not trying to find a way to be troublesome it's just that I am shocked that people might think otherwise.  IOW - This is me trying to broaden my own perspective, if you will.\n<blockquote>It also opens up the possibility that two different agendas are at play in the group, with their own cross-interacting reward cycles, one for the players and one for the GM.</blockquote>\nAs I'm reading this statement I don't see anything particularly controversial.  Making a movie is lots of very dull hard work.  Watching the movie is, hopefully, an emotionally satisfying experience.  I understand that we player's aren't passively watching a preconstructed event but the general idea holds that the reasons that each respective side is doing what they are doing very different even if they both "love" movies.<br/><br/>In short I agree the players and the DM are motivated (have their own agendas) by different reasons.  In our case we all love Middle Earth in its style and messages.  We all wish we could "be there."<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483771/#Comment_483771" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T02:24:08+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  2:24AM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2019 2:26AM by Paul_T.">edited May 20</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jay,<br/><br/>I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t take that as some kind of insult. In a lot of roleplaying traditions/cultures, the idea of \u201cGM as entertainer\u201d is something that is strongly derided, or at least something that people try to avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>For instance, the OSR play culture tends to move towards \u201cGM as impartial referee\u201d, which often has to take precedence over the role of the entertainer (and the intention to entertain could be seen as undercutting some of the values of play). <br/><br/>In the Forge-derived culture (and probably in LARP or forum roleplay culture), there is an effort to present the GM as an equal player, simply with slightly different responsibilities. <br/><br/>This can become an important point and something to argue about - the caricature of the GM as a \u201cmonkey, dancing for the entertainment of the players\u201d is sometimes referenced, to give you an idea of how some people might see their role.<br/><br/>If you read Emma\u2019s posts about her group\u2019s play style, you\u2019ll see that there the GM is seen as a supporting figure who must always follow the player\u2019s lead and be careful not to step on the player\u2019s toes in any way.<br/><br/>The idea of GM as entertainer is most at home in that \u201c90s\u201d style, the concept of the \u201cGM as storyteller\u201d. It seems to me that your game falls pretty squarely in that camp! And loose mechanics that are interpreted at the GM\u2019s beck and call are also pretty classic characteristics of that style, I\u2019d say. It\u2019s much easier to be an entertainer, after all, if the mechanics are \u201csubordinate to game play as opposed to directive\u201d, as you suggest in this thread. Seems like a natural match!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483773/#Comment_483773" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T02:37:12+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  2:37AM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2019 2:41AM by EmmatheExcrucian.">edited May 20</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group and I don't have a GM in our play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483776/#Comment_483776" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T03:21:49+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  3:21AM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, sorry!

We all play NPCs at times. The HG is just always on-hand to play them when everyone else is occupied. The HG also sometimes plays her own PC, but that depends on what the particular story needs. In Part 1 of our big story cycle, for instance, she's not playing a PC, but she will be in Parts 2 and 3, because there's a character who started out as a side character who then we decided to make more important, and eventually we decided that she needs to have her own scenes. <br/>The HG doesn't do the typical GM stuff though, other than that she's often playing NPCs. She doesn't have any more control of the rules and the story than anyone else, she's not portraying an objective world because there's no concept of objective reality in our play, and generally she has less power than everyone else, because we all have veto power through our PCs, and she lacks veto power (well, when she's not playing a PC). Also, she doesn't run the game at all.<br/>The HG role at a distance looks GM-esque, but then when you really get into the specifics of how Chuubo's works, it doesn't resemble anything like a GM at all, if that makes sense. It's an asymmetric non-GM role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483778/#Comment_483778" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T03:41:27+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  3:41AM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it could be very informative to look at the concept of GM as Entertainer with new eyes.<br/><br/>So often only degenerate cases are noted, that it might be worth looking at a de-mystified functional case more thoroughly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483780/#Comment_483780" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-20T04:07:48+00:00" title="May 20, 2019  4:07AM">May 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emma,<br/><br/>Ok, cool!

But once again I have to take strenuous and vigorous exception to the use of the word "storyteller."  The DM does not have a prepared "story" that we are walking through.  Ontologically the individual scenarios find their genesis with the question of "what if?"  His self-stated guiding principle for generating the idea of possible events for a night's play are "Simple scenario, complex characters."  By scenario we're mostly talking about beginning of game scene framing stuff.  He might have some beats on standby but if the scenario flows into a different direction then so be it.  I can't tell you how many times he's told me about his scenario prep where he was certain that we'd turn right where we'd gone left instead (by analogy)<br/><br/>I have an example story but it's getting late but I'll leave notes in this post to remind what I was going to write.

For instance, in many OSR circles, the GM will just sit there and <i>not say a word</i> until the players have chosen a course of action (which could take a long time!), and then respond tersely with the outcome, and it's back to players deliberating. In this style of play, sometimes the GM hardly speaks at all, except to call out for the outcomes of rolls and questions from the players (not always; there are many different ways to run an OSR game - but I've seen that a few times, and it's fun and effective).<br/><br/>Cary definitely seems to be really important/involved in the "telling" part of that, at least, even if "story" is more open-ended. (I think it's almost impossible to tell how open-ended your play really is, though, given how much of the control is in Cary's hands and how there is no way to verify how outcomes are eventually settled, with rare exceptions where he might say what rolled result is needed before the dice hit the table.) <br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that in the actual play I analyzed there was a stretch of about 40 minutes where <i>no other player even spoke</i> (except to call out roll results), which would be nearly unthinkable in many/most other play styles. (And, yes, I know that's not typical of the game in general, but it's still something that I think "GM as storyteller" describes quite well. Compare that to Emma's Chuubo's game, or <i>Sorcerer</i>, where a player comes to the table and gets to declare what their character's story is before the GM even gets to say a word; likewise compare to any of dozens/hundreds of "indie games" where the player always frames the scenes for their own character, saying where the action takes place, who's there, what's happening, and what we are going to find out while we play through the scene.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483860/#Comment_483860" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T05:41:11+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  5:41AM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Look at behavior surrounding examples of major character death or near death, whether PCs or NPCs, and try to figure out the ( who what why where when) thinking behind those events at the real people level.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding that stuff will help a ton at understanding GM as entertainer.<br/><br/><br/>( BTW, I can totally see GM as Entertainer having a high relation to fidelity to setting, but not pre-determined plotlines, much as you describe Cary talking about when you went right instead of left.

So what is the beginning/middle/end of a reward cycle for him?<br/><br/><br/>I have some guesses of my own ( and, from the sounds of it, have GMed more than a bit like Cary myself at times, although not quite to the same extent/evolved state that this game has reached), but I'm curious what other people think, especially those that have GMed in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>Yeah, time for a bit of introspection, y'all.

I couldn't be too sure; the nature of the GM's role in this game is very deliberately opaque, which makes it difficult. In my experience, GMs running games in this style, even if asked directly, can't or won't explain how and why they run things they do, either because they lie, because they don't understand it themselves, or because they're just so used to "maintaining the illusion" that it's become a habit for them (for instance, they might fear that even a conversation with someone not in their game could somehow make it back to their group and thereby ruin everything).<br/><br/>Take a look at the link Sandra posted above: the second page has some really good and insightful thoughts and observations on this front from Jay (Silmenume).

Or are you asking how often we generate brand new characters in general and how do they end up getting play time?<br/><br/>To the first interpretation I would again answer that we almost always only play a single character from our folder in a given session of play.  Sometimes if our night's character is sidelined for whatever reason (walked out of scenario, injured to the point of ineffectiveness/unconsciousness) we'll petition for another existing character to find their way to the group if we have one that is in the area.  Otherwise we pick up one of the NPC's for the night.  Or we might get a blank sheet and start with a quick thumbnail description and encounter the group - which can be quite fun.  We can walk our character out of a scenario at any point situation allowing.  Leaving a group is usually very dangerous as travelling alone in the wilderness <i>is not safe</i>.  If one is confined by geography, like a dungeon, then walking away means walking out of dungeon by oneself which is pretty much a death sentence.  Then there is the problem of who you're going to play with the on going scenario.  Again you have the problem of geography and the problem of finding someone who you can play.  On the rare occasion that this happens the GM may just split the game between your solo character and the group but that means long down times.<br/><br/>In short, circumstances permitting, we players can choose if we want to leave the scenario.  The DM has <i>final</i> authority over which character actually plays in the scenario.  This decision is informed by player input but final authority sits with the GM.<br/><br/>To the second interpretation I would say that is a very complex topic.  When we used to play more frequently in our youths getting brand new characters happened far more frequently.  As we have playing far less frequently these last 10 years or so the generation of new characters has slowed way down.  The most common method of new character generation comes when a scenario is being put together and we don't have an existing character that fits.  Frequently he'll give us lots of options and we'll discuss the character concept before rolling up.  Sometimes he'll say that he has a really cool character idea and we'll roll up but the character isn't fully unveiled to the player in all its glory until it is introduced in the night's play.  Sometimes we'll have an interesting idea and again talk it over with the GM and then roll it up for an upcoming game.  <br/><br/>Sometimes we'll gain a character by jumping in playing some sort of NPC is such a way we are asked if we'd like to keep the character.  FREX - the scenario was the armies of Gondor preparing to assault and retake Osgiliath.  The character I had was relatively minor so at some point when there was quiet moment I just started playing a siege engineer giving orders and responding to an emergency.  This went on for a minute or two and the DM looked at me somewhat bemusedly and said, "That's pretty cool.  You want to keep the character?"  I said, "Sure!"  I got a blank character sheet and there you go.<br/><br/>I should note that almost every scenario is a one off as far as the PC's are concerned.  The standard MO is that various PC's end up in a certain locale for different reasons but are bound to something that is happening in the area which when resolved releases us to our various individual directions as per our character's wants, desires, goals, needs, history, etc.<br/><br/>I don't know if I answered your question at all or not.

However, this does not mean the process is completely unilateral and players can petition for a character if it makes sense geographically and the desired character is not currently involved in some other event.  From what I understand scenario creation will typically start with one or more anchor characters so they <i>tend</i> to be fixed.  The "secondary" characters are then woven in and these are the ones that the players have much more input into what character they'd like to play.<br/><br/>Regarding your two example questions the second one is typically framed more as, "I haven't played Astaldo (a tower guard in my case) in while, I'd really like to play him soon."  So most of the time it's the DM saying, "I've got a scenario for next time about the siege of Gondor" and then he would anchor the scenario around a few key PC's.  Then he would go through player folders casting about for potential characters that would fit asking us who we'd like to play.  If we don't have any characters that <i>could</i> be there or <i>make sense</i> being there then a new character would be rolled up.<br/><br/>This - "I'd like to see what's happening with my character in Gondor--we should try to retake Osgiliath" would never fly.  It's not a matter of GM control but rather a matter of scope.  Taking Osgiliath is a major war effort and would require the mobilizing of a very large military force.  This would be a decision that only a head of state such as the Steward of Gondor could make.  Now if someone had a character who had, over many many years of play, managed to become a counselor to the Steward then such a character could advocate for the war but that would be a multiyear/multi scenario effort.<br/><br/>We can always advocate for a scenario or a character but he's got to find a way to make a workable scenario out of the requests.  Being lazy, we usually advocate for a character rather than present a scenario hook.  One of the issues the GM has to wrestle with is HOW to get as many existing characters into a given scenario as possible in as plausible manner as possible.  Its not enough that a PC be physically present they need a reason or motive for being involved as most scenarios tend to extremely dangerous.  Nobody goes out to risk their lives to be eaten by alive by Orcs just because they are looking for something to do.<br/><br/>I know nobody is implying this but I want to say this just to get it out in the open, we don't play murder hobos.  Not out of snobbery but because of how we play no one wants to die and trying to kill things that don't want to die either makes for some potentially very lethal situations.  Thus the PC in any scenario has to be well motivated to be in the scenario or the player would walk his character out.  It's not just enough for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> PC to be motivated for the scenario but all the PCs need to motivated, <i>each in their own way</i>, and in such a way as to hold them together geographically.  The PC's may be at cross purposes but a way needs to be created to hold them together.<br/><br/>I don't know if this sheds any light on the process.  It is open and complicated just like the game play process itself.  In fact much of scenario creation could be thought of as an extension of the game play process itself.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484043/#Comment_484043" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-23T00:26:23+00:00" title="May 23, 2019 12:26AM">May 23</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2019 12:46AM by Silmenume.">edited May 23</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think the "GM as storyteller" can range pretty strongly from fully-plotted-railroaded to a more free frame, where the actors within it retain the freedom to act as they wish.</p></div></blockquote>\nHere's the deal with using "storyteller".  Its a terrible word because is both ill defined and absolutely loaded with freighted meanings and emotions.  Given what most of those meanings point to it is as poisonous a term to use regarding this discussion as you've mentioned many times to me as using the word "Simulationism".  The very word is so encrusted with acrimony and definitions that it is functionally useless to honest conversation.<br/><br/>I have no problems with the saying the GM spent a looooooong time scene framing but it appears to me (and I'm likely wrong) that you're reading this some sort of relative of "reading from prepared materials."  The GM is not exercising his narration rights to entertain the players with his creative narrative skills.  That would be an ex-SIS process (extra-diegetic).  Our game functions as much as humanly possible in the SIS and that includes scene framing.  This can make scene framing take a long time and can appear to curtail player agency for a period of time.  That is not the case.  The GM is creating the Setting, mood, motivations, direct and indirect conflicts, PC's, NPC's, clues, bangs and what not all from within the SIS.  IOW he's painting the "physical world" while stocking the closet of the Bricoleur chock full of goodies.  Again this is all shown "concretely" within the SIS as opposed to talked about "abstractly" outside the SIS.  This means the most difficult task of all, establishing motives/goals has to be shown/demonstrated rather than stated.\n<blockquote>Cary definitely seems to be really important/involved in the "telling" part of that, at least, even if "story" is more open-ended.</blockquote>\nI don't disagree that at portion of the game Cary is very important.  I like I mentioned above, he's aggressively scene framing using Mythic Bricolage which can appear to be unwieldy and overly long to point of dominating the play by the GM.  The question is to what end and that I've already covered above.  The various pieces are being put into place by demonstration, given a direction (motivation) by demonstration and then play  transitions to the players.  All of this via a subjective meaning creation process.<br/><br/>I suppose it's the difference between saying to a character, "You're angry", and describing a series of events that ought to elicit the emotion of anger in the player.  "Anger" as a word is an abstraction of the actual emotion.  Showing scenes or events is using the "concrete" of "real events" to make someone feel the real emotion of "Anger".  It's also akin to describing someone sitting down in a ragged but comfortable seat than just saying there is a chair in the room.<br/><br/>Hopefully I've made some headway in reframing the process away of "storyteller."  If we really want to stretch the metaphor to the breaking point one could possibly say he's giving motivation to the actors before the improv starts.  Please don't take this analogy too far, it was a spur of the moment thought and not well thought through.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484044/#Comment_484044" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-23T00:44:04+00:00" title="May 23, 2019 12:44AM">May 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tl;dr (sorry, you all are on a roll)<br/><br/>Has anyone looked at Fantaji with this thread topic in mind?

I sort of get the impression that the GM's job is to help uplift the players, to foster in them an understanding that allows them to experience things the "right way."

Makes me want to try this kind of troupe play (with character folders).  It sounds like a good way to let the GM introduce scenarios he is interested in, without railroading characters who wouldn't logically be involved.<br/><br/>I see what you mean about my Osgiliath example being too large in scope to be initiated by the player characters.  What about something of an appropriate scope?  Suppose you said, "My ranger character wants to sneak into Orc-held Osgiliath to retrieve the sword he lost there."  (Maybe he feels dishonoured because he left his sword while fleeing in cowardice, and wants to retrieve it to prove his courage.)<br/><br/>What I mean to say with this example is: suppose there is something you think that one of your characters would want to do, that is plausible given the character's position in the fiction, and would likely lead to an adventure.  But you haven't played that character recently.  Do you ever petition the GM for a scenario by saying what you actively want your character to do in the world like this?  Or are the scenarios mainly reactive to some outside event that the GM introduces?  Or would it be the role of the GM to say, "Jay, I know your character wants to retrieve his lost sword.

But the notion of experiencing things the "right way" is a stumbling block.  That may be how the beginning of game scene framing works but after that it's much more of a give and take.  The GM's ultimate goal might to be said to be to facilitate the highest level of "experience" in each player, <i>whatever</i> that "experience" might be.  That "experience" is a product of both player and GM action so there is no way to know ahead of time what that "experience" is going to be.<br/><br/>Maybe I need to work that through with more thought and time.  Despite my reservations (which I'm <b>not</b> claiming as solid arguments against) we've come back to the idea of tribal societies and preliterate mythic cultures.  Which I do find interesting/validating.\n<blockquote>The best example of a "90s GM" I ever played with was also a stage magician.

As a magician you have to create a reality for them specifically so you can defy it, but maybe the important thing for this style of play is that <i>there's no reason you can't also do the same thing for the sake of reinforcing that reality.</i></blockquote>\nI'm not sure what a "90s GM" means.  I know this much of my own GMs roleplay history.  He was introduced to D&amp;D via the boxed set.  Maybe they got to AD&amp;D but he never sought out another gaming system after that.  When he grew frustrated with the limitations of the system (for a whole host of reasons) he spent several years "creating" his own game system and by the very early 80's was running and futzing with it ever since.  He never went on boards or to conventions but he did on occasion run in game stores.  IOW his entire DMing career was run in complete isolation from what the rest of the world was doing.<br/><br/>Addressing the analogy of the magician as you described it I agree with your assertion that "there's no reason you can't also do the same thing for the sake of reinforcing that reality."  The difference between role-play games and the audience members to a magic show is that the "audience" of the RPG exercises agency.  The way I'm reading your example is an excellent example of CA specific player deprotagonization.  It's not enough that the "reality" be reinforced by the GM because said reinforcement while a necessary process of play is not sufficient to allow player agency.  The players are an active part of not only reinforcing but creating and expanding that "reality".<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484077/#Comment_484077" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-23T19:22:37+00:00" title="May 23, 2019  7:22PM">May 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reluctant to the shaman as a guide image, because it's very glamour, a tad too much.

As a quick aside I should note that our GM does grouse a bit that we players don't do this more often!<br/><br/>The key is that in proposing such a scenario he has to build the session so that all the other players at the table also have characters and reasons to be involved either in your quest or have an interest in what's going on in Osgiliath.  That's the really difficult part of getting something like that off the ground.  You've got your goal mapped out and why which is cool.  Now we've got to do the same for all the other players.  To make the dynamics interesting rarely does the night's group of PC have the same goals or reasons for doing something. So the GM needs to create reasons for everyone going with you (that align with the other PCs goals and motivations) and then set up tensions within and without all at the same time.  Then to spice things up maybe your character is specifically forbidden by your officer to go into Osgiliath because of the upcoming major military action.  Now we've got stakes that are playing against each other.\n<blockquote>Or are the scenarios mainly reactive to some outside event that the GM introduces?</blockquote>\nThis is common.\n<blockquote>Or would it be the role of the GM to say, "Jay, I know your character wants to retrieve his lost sword.  Let's do a scenario about that!"</blockquote>\nThis does happen as well but as shown above its a big sticky cluster for all the reasons noted above.  A night's game has to encompass all the players so the idea behind a scenario is never so cut and dried but it certainly can be used as fodder in the creation process of a scenario. FREX - the idea of getting the Ranger's sword might end up just being one piece of the entirety of the scenario.<br/><br/>His general guiding principle in generating scenarios is give the players what the want, just not in the form they expect it.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484080/#Comment_484080" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-23T20:03:22+00:00" title="May 23, 2019  8:03PM">May 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I was reluctant to the shaman as a guide image, because it's very glamour, a tad too much.

How does the group handle this kind of thing?</p></div></blockquote>\nThis all happened back in 2004.  My memories are pretty hazy but if I recall those Dunedain that we're going marched up to the Dimril Stair towards the gate.  The last Dunadan through (an NPC) looked back to the player Dunadan who refused to go.  The NPC waited a few moments giving the PC Dunadan a chance to change his mind then turned and entered the Dimril Gate.  And I <i>think</i> that was the last we visited that particular PC for the night.<br/><br/>This was another night of two stories working at once.  The major one was the Dragon attack on Rivendale whereby a number of important personages fled south toward the Gates of Moria to pull the Dragon away from Imladris.  Elrond was present as was Arwen, Glorfindel, Frodo, Turindir (who was to die this day), lots of PC's (whose names all escape me as my folder was stolen out of my car about 2 years ago costing me about 20 years of accumulated notes on all my characters).  The other concurrent scenario was the speed run through Moria of the entire fighting force (less one) of the above mentioned Dunedain.  So the player who dropped out of the Dunedain run through Moria was out of that part of the scenario as there was no possible way to get another character in (existing or new) who could and would fit.  Said player still had a character on the other side of Moria (just inside the gates of Moria) with Elrond and his crew.<br/><br/>The momentum of the night was such that splitting the scenario 3 ways was not going to work.  The two scenarios were rushing at each other like freight trains so the player just had to sit out the Dunedain sections of the night.  The only other people who could keep up with the Dunedain would have been the Elves and the player did not have one in the immediate area.  On the other hand the player could have been given a new elf but -<br/><br/>A.  The Dunedain would have refused such an innocent on the run.<br/>B.  The Dunedain would have foreseen that such a young elf (read 1st level) would have been more hindrance than help should there be combat and would not want to have squandered such a life.  As it was some 450+ levels of Dunedain were accounted for and for myself I was the lowest accounted at 10th level.<br/><br/>I'll touch more on this topic as per Paul's questions soon but it is late for me here on my end.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484158/#Comment_484158" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T19:27:25+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  7:27PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2019 1:19AM by Silmenume.">edited May 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi <a href="/forums/profile/shimrod">@shimrod</a> ,\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For that game, did the player keep playing this character, and did the GM keep describing what was happening to and around this character?

Yes, your formulation is correct that typically the player will have to detach his POV from that particular character (first, reluctant Dunadan).  He's where things can get interesting and possibly difficult to articulate.  After a character is removed from a scenario it may take a while to work a new one back in.  One of the methods typically used to prevent the problem of a player not having anyone to play is that very frequently the DM has NPCs involved in the scenario with the PCs.  They are used for many reasons not least of which is to stir the pot within the group.  However if a player is left without a character then the player is often offered one of the NPC's.  If the player is not interested then it may take more than an hour to allow for the opportunity for the introduction of a new PC from outside the group.  This can be an existing character from the player's folder if a character is in the geographic area, not tied up in some other event and doesn't destroy the party dynamic.  If no such character exists then a brand new character is offered.  This is usually quickly done as we don't want to lose the momentum and mood of the scenario.  A blank character sheet is handed out and when the character does eventually meet the group a quick sketch of what he looks like is provided and the player a few salient skills are noted to provided as a starting place as well as a simple motivation or goal.  Once the new character is released the player has a lot of latitude to play him as he wishes - though Bricolage demands that the player <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></i> completely ignore the very raw character sketch provided.<br/><br/>I don't know if that addresses your questions or not.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484165/#Comment_484165" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T20:15:32+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  8:15PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you explain that last sentence?

Is this what you are looking for and whose perspective are you looking for exactly</div></blockquote>\nI waited but I didn't hear back on my request for clarification so I'll forge ahead and hope that what I post is relevant.<br/><br/>Instead of using the example from about 2 months ago I'll borrow from a game a played 2 nights ago.  I believe context is necessary as it will help shed light on possible motivations or internal states of the involved players and the GM.<br/><br/>Silitare - a "Grey" Numenorean.  He was bit several months ago (in game time) by an ancient Numenorean "Queen".  She had been imprisoned on an island inside a Numenorean built tower her goaler was an Istari who over the course of spending 3000 years alone slipped his mooring a bit.  Silitare was pushing towards being "good" in that he occasionally saw and spoke with his putative Guardian Angel.  He had the burgeoning ability of "True Sight" which among other things allowed him to see the "True" nature of a person or a monsters essence/soul.  He had on several occasions banished ghosts/spirits/spectres.  One time he "created" ad nihilo a sword and crown of light that was devastating against incorporeal "Evil" creatures.  Back in the scenario where he was eventually bit he had been in mental communication with this Numenorean Queen and establishing the precursors to a relationship.  The play had decided that his Character was lonely and so player this as a possible relationship.  The player did not know she was a vampire and was beyond visual range in the tower.  At the climax of the night he called her knowing that she was "dark" but with the hopes that there was still some "light" left in her - whatever she was.  When she came before him, they spoke some and he "gifted her with Light".   She immediately burst into flames but in an instant she bit him and said, "You give me Light, I give you Darkness!".  She was blown back hundreds of feet into air and eventually fell into the ocean and that was the last we saw of her.  The tower exploded, rockslides fell, general apocalyptic stuff happened.  Silitare was played in another scenario as fighting and slowly losing against his vampiric infection.  Which as player was exactly where he wanted to be - a character at war between his two conflicting persons.  I should also note this is one of his first characters he got in our game when he joined 10 years ago and is one of his favorite characters.  This is important.<br/><br/>Eriador - was played by MS, the DM's son aged 14.  The PC was a boy on a nearby island who had managed to escape slavery by living off the land with a couple of other boy and by some light raiding.  When my PC, a fellow "Grey Numenorean" and a long time friend of Silitare went to the site of recent heavy battle Eriador followed at some distance behind us.  He saw Silitare come upon a sentry, battle him with his bare hands, bite his throat out and finally rip the sentry's heart still beating heart of the man's chest and consume it.  Eriador cried out when he witnessed this and was set upon by Silitare.  Silitare paroled the boy when he "<i>Oathswore </i>" himself to Silitare.  In our game a solemn "Oath" has real binding affects the breaking of which has devastating large scale consequences.  So this was <i>Big</i>.<br/><br/>In the above scenario my character Noldamo was pulled to the island when he had the same dream three night running of myself dipping my hand into a pool of water and saying, "I have found the cure."  At the time I didn't know what that meant but I had interior knowledge of where the island was and so I convinced another character whom I was travelling with to sail to the Island.  Apparently Silitare had a similar "Vision" and was pulled back to the island as he was looking for me (we had been separated some time ago in the past and Silitare knew that he was in some sort of trouble and was seeking help as well as the succor of friendship).  That scenario ended with myself (Noldamo), Silitare, Eriador and another boy ascending the mountain.<br/><br/>We begin this last game with us ascending up the mountain.  For myself, as a player, I was extremely on edge as long history has shown me that a PC in Silitare's condition, should he roll as little a single '1' (if the PC is under particularly high stress) or more likely, multiple "1's" will cave into his hunger and there wouldn't be a whole lot I could do to survive it short of absolutely amazing dice rolling and I'm a rather poor roller overall.  Already, under the influence of the "Dark", his speed, strength and endurance were well beyond human normal.  I'd also seen a wound close over in under a minute.  Silitare was acting strange and attention would seem to drift in and out of focus with the world - like he was looking or seeing things that weren't there.  So this was stressful for me as a player.  My Character was confused and having a hard time understanding what was going on with his childhood friend and probably one of the last few surviving Numenorean's alive in the world.<br/><br/>Twice, when Silitare had outpaced me up the mountain and was out of sight, a man dressed in <i>immaculate</i> clothing that looked very close to mine and our people's when we had a home stepped out of the jungle <i>right</i> in front of me.  Didn't hear him moving through the bush.  In fluent Adunaic(!) he counselled me that if I wished to save my friend I would have to destroy him.  The first time I called out to Silitare and just as he came into view the man strode back into the jungle.  The man appeared a second time with the same message but this time I took some time to try and find out his bona fides and his interest in the matter.  How did he know?  Silitare had some me stories about the weirdness of the island and earlier adventures we had encountered some Numenorean ghosts so while this was highly irregular it wasn't my first brush with the <i>weird</i>.  I didn't act on this but was deep in thought.  We finally arrived at a suitable camping place for the night.<br/><br/>During the night while Silitare and Noldamo spoke the GM had the same man appear to Eriador which neither of us saw or felt.  The man told Eriador that he needed to destroy the one that was Silitare.  Said he was great evil and the world would suffer much if he wasn't destroyed.  The man gave Eriador a dagger of white and silver instructing him that not only would he have to stab Silitare in the heart but that the knife would have to stay in the heart and the dagger tip would have to be embedded into the earth.  IOW Silitare would have to be staked to the earth.  Eriador asked when he should do this and the man said, "You will know."<br/><br/>Part 1 of 2                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume" title="Silmenume"><img alt="Silmenume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">Silmenume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484480/#Comment_484480" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T21:45:47+00:00" title="May 27, 2019  9:45PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2019 2:52AM by Silmenume.">edited May 28</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 of 2<br/><br/>This was all played out in the open so all players knew what went down.  So poor MS was in a terrible position of being tasked with the killing of another player's favorite character.  Dax, the player of Silitare, went out of his way not to play on the knowledge that he was privy to.  Lots of tension now at the table.  Not negative player to player tension, but real emotional tension.  MS struggling with the difficulty of having to decide whether or not to kill a favorite PC of another player and Dax knowing that MS had both the means to kill his favorite character and had in character motivation to do so while purposefully not acting on this information was very tense for both.<br/><br/>During the night we hear shrieks and weird laughter coming from the tower above us.  Clouds are swirling above us with lightning dancing around us.  We had also found a couple of bodies that looked like they had fallen a great distance.  The spook factor was pretty high and climbing.<br/><br/>Next day we begin our ascent and Dax starts to try and form his crown of light when MS strikes.  Sure enough he bangs a natural "20".  The DM has Dax roll and he too bangs a natural "20".  Ugh.  One of the "rules" of the game is that in PvP combat a defensive natural "20" always beats the attacker's natural "20".  Faster than sight can follow Silitare catches Eriador's wrist and manages to just slightly redirect the blow away from his heart.  With main strength Silitare lifts Eriador by the neck, mimes a twisting motion with his wrist saying "snap" breaking Eriador's neck.  Silitare removes the knife then walks Eriador's body to the cliff calls him an "Oath breaker" and tosses the body over.<br/><br/>That was it for the die rolling on that event.  However the DM did make it known that the knife was burning Silitare's hand.  So it was it was either Elven or Holy.  I mention this as the GM had given a powerful tool to the younger player so that he could present a credible threat and have a real chance at pulling off his charge.<br/><br/>Did this mean the DM meant for Silitare to die?  No.<br/>Did this mean the DM meant for Eriador to die?  No.<br/>For my own part, as much as it broke my own heart as a player, I started miming pulling my sword (Noldamo) and striking down at Eriador (MS - my Godson) but the event was over before I got there.<br/><br/>This was all part of the big, "What if?"  The idea not being that we are just playing our characters but that we as players are emotionally involved.<br/><br/>I'll try and get in the specifics of your five questions of the real people in my follow up post.  Sorry if this post seemed like a dodge of your questions but I felt it was necessary to establish the pressures cooking the players directly via the SIS before I got into speculating on the motives of the real players.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484481/#Comment_484481" name="Item_183" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-27T22:20:38+00:00" title="May 27, 2019 10:20PM">May 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a fantastic example!
