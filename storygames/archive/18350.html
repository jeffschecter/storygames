Basically, it's part of the Mythic GM Emulator built into a notepad.  You ask yes/no questions and then roll on them.<br/><br/>I want to use it to create a small squad/force/party/group of characters with interesting relationships.<br/><br/>So, I might ask:<br/><br/>Is the leader a male?  <br/>Then I roll "50/50" (or "Somewhat Likely"...whatever makes sense)<br/>If the answer is "no", then the leader is a female.<br/>Is she an alien?<br/>Is she pilot of the ship?<br/><br/>And I use this method to get to a team of people for a starship crew or a dungeon adventuring party or a skirmish squad.  It can have really interesting results in terms of teams that I would not have put together if I had chosen them.<br/><br/>What I would love is some yes/no questions that would really make the relationships interesting.  Crews of people that squabble, fall in love, backstabbing...jealousy.<br/><br/>Does X get along with Y?<br/>What other yes/no questions can you think of that I could employ to get interesting relationships?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413674/#Comment_413674" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-07T09:24:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2013  9:24AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2013 9:27AM by Dreamer.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Did X and Y grow up together?"<br/>"Did X and Y date the same person at one point?"<br/>"Did X break Y's heart in the past?"<br/><br/>I personally like mythic complex questions a bit better, though.

I think what you should look for is questions that give something no matter what you ask. Asking about if X or Y is brothers would be uninteresting if it said "no", so what you could do is always implying things. Here follows some example.<br/><br/>AGENDAS<br/>- Have I betrayed you yet?<br/>- Did I manage to kill someone you cared about?<br/><br/>ESTABLISHING FACTS ABOUT ANOTHER<br/>- Do I know about your secret?<br/>- Are your enemy also mine?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413743/#Comment_413743" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T09:06:42+00:00" title="May  8, 2013  9:06AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see this working with character creation but for actual game play it might be a little lacking. Given that this is a solo game maybe you could write out two events - one from the point of view of "screw the character" and another from the point of view of "the character succeeds" and do a 50/50 roll to see what happens next. The story could grow incrementally from there. It would keep with you yes/no dichotomy. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413822/#Comment_413822" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-09T09:23:47+00:00" title="May  9, 2013  9:23AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard - Those are good questions.  I guess I naturally think of my questions in terms of a "no" answer means something important anyway.  Thanks for the suggestions.<br/><br/>Chris - It might not work for everyone, but it just seems to shine for me.  For some reason it hits that sweet spot.  I have a tendency to word my questions during play such that I really care about the answer and am invested in the result.  I ran through a playing of a Minecraft-like game the other day and this character was just barely surviving the whole time and rolling terribly.  Loved every brutal minute of it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413823/#Comment_413823" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-09T10:03:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2013 10:03AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We all like cartoons.
