If you need something that looks good in a short amount of time you will need to bring in help. If you can take a while and would rather have the experience of doing it yourself and are OK if your first thing only comes out average-looking in the end, do that.

If you want this to be a beautiful, well-designed book that will sell, you should probably rely on a designer's expertise.  If you simply want to publish your own book for fun and as a learning exercise, by all means do some research and dig into it yourself.    It's not terribly difficult to lay out and publish your own book, but it is a very different thing to do it well.<br/><br/>Also, you asked us to assume the text has been done, but I would stress that having someone else (i.e. someone who is not the writer) edit the content is essential to producing a decent publication of any sort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250506/#Comment_250506" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T12:59:08+00:00" title="January 12, 2010 12:59PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that it's not easy (speaking as someone who can't do it).

For a while I thought the tool was the harder part (InDesign, for which I believe a student license actually allows for-profit work), but that's not the case.

Do not expect to be a designer--rather, just try to make some existing template (even if "Normal" or "Default" or whatever) work for your content. Then iterate: if you use Styles (as you SHOULD!) then you can play around with global type and paragraph tweaks; try different simple graphics in your page templates; mess around with generated content (table of contents, subTOCs, indices, glossary, table of tables/figures, etc, etc).<br/><br/>You will not become a "good designer." You *might* learn a few Best Practices for doing desktop publishing for print. It will take you (probably) ten to twenty times as long to achieve a given "look" as it would a pro (regardless of tools); and so you have to ask yourself if your time is worth 5% of a professional's. (Hint: I charge total strangers $60 - $75 an hour to do layout; so do you earn less than $3 - $4 an hour? If so, you are ahead of the game. If not, then you are violating the Givens Principle (I am assuming you don't want to get into book design as a recreation or for relaxation). You're better off going to work for those hours you would try to layout your book, and then hiring someone who can achieve your vision in a fraction of the time it would take you.<br/><br/>Just being honest, man: I don't try to rebuild my motorcycle engine because I don't earn three times what a mechanic earns, and it seems to take me around 3x the book hours for major jobs, PLUS I don't often have specialty tools that make it faster to do a given job.

Typically the government relies on whistleblowers to catch commercial piracy. However, Adobe or whoever may have a tiny code implanted in any design you make and they might privately track you. As a small RPG developer, this is unlikely since you don't have any money and a lawsuit would be expensive and yield no profits.  <br/><br/>Basically, if you don't have a commercial copy, you're taking a risk.

Trained layout people will make your text look much, much better than you can.</li></ul>\nSo there are different routes you can take. For the first, you don't need to learn <i>anything</i>. Just write your game in Word, make it look vaguely nice and upload the result to Lulu. Then, your game will be published, and people can buy it. Don't knock this route. It gets your game out there.<br/><br/>For the second route, you learn <i>just enough</i> to lay out your game in a barely adequate fashion. Get a copy of Scribus or Serif Page Plus. Read some online tutorials. Find a book you like, which is simply laid out, and emulate it. Keep putting your layout away for a few days and looking back at it, changing the things that bother you. This is a very rewarding thing to do and you'll learn a lot. You'll end up with something you'll be proud of, although some people will spot it's not a professional layout.<br/><br/>For the third route, you work with a designer. Find someone you like and drop them a line. People are friendly and will talk you through various options.<br/><br/>As a personal opinion, I think we put too many barriers in the way of people who want to publish RPGs. We tell people to hire layout artists, editors, proofreaders and artists. But you can do most of this yourself: not as well, but adequately. For your first RPG, doing it yourself is a good option, since you probably don't want to spend too much money. Once you've done it yourself, you'll see <i>exactly</i> how much better professional layouts look, and you'll consider hiring a professional next time.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250595/#Comment_250595" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T04:54:45+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  4:54AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keith, the answers to your questions:<br/><br/>1.

Ben: no hassles on the pith, I expected it from my vague and fuzzy opening.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo elaborate I had taken Graphic Communications to Highers (A-level equivalent for Scotland, 17yrs old), but then closed that path of learning - so while I can remember the basics and can even identify books with good layout, my actual skills for production started out basic and have rusted somewhat. Thankfully my partner-in-crime is a very talented arts student who has a Student copy of the full adobe package and so I'm relying on them for all art/layout decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have another friend who had contacts with publishers so I may forego Lulu's and take the (initially more expensive) route of self-funding the first print run, and I think that I can break even down that route if I can find a distribution method (I'll prob look towards IPR, Un-Store and the like). As for using this to get a small pot of cash for future projects, I am assuming that I'll only have one idea worth publishing and trying my best with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250663/#Comment_250663" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T13:34:33+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  1:34PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have a talented art student helping w/ layout, you're basically well ahead of the game, as far as indie book design goes.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250697/#Comment_250697" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T16:55:36+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  4:55PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Fyans</cite>I also have another friend who had contacts with publishers so I may forego Lulu's and take the (initially more expensive) route of self-funding the first print run, and I think that I can break even down that route if I can find a distribution method (I'll prob look towards IPR, Un-Store and the like).</blockquote>\nThat sounds good. If you can fund a print run, and are prepared to put a bit of work into selling them, it'll probably give you a better rate of return than Lulu.<br><br/>If you're using the Unstore, consider sending the books out yourself, if the books are light. Airmail postage to the States is surprisingly cheap: when sending a book to someone in the States, IPR's shipping costs more than if I posted it myself. It depends whether you want the hassle of fulfilling orders yourself, of course, but it's surprisingly feasible. (I'm assuming you're in the UK, for that last paragraph.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
