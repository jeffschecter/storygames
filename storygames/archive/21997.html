                    I wanted to address this post, I'm not sure why, I mean people can use a thing however they like, but I thought I'd just write out my preference.<br/><br/>So, if you approach attempting to answer this question thru system, you abandon story, which is fine, but realize what's taking place.  You can make a system that addresses each creatures natural enemy, or trigger to violence.  For example trolls hate fire, and will attack the closest thing giving off flame or heat.  Orcs hate the smell of dwarf, and will attack them purely on scent.  But none of these things are making it any more of a story.  They're adding detail, but detail is just one very small part of something, and it can distract from a premise, if you even bother to have something approaching it.  <br/><br/>If your desire is to empower your friends, connect them to this thing that's going on, story is a good way to do that.  <br/><br/>Maybe this monster lost it's mother to one of the magical weapons, now in the hands of the current adventuring party?  Isn't that a juicier motivation?  You could even flashback to when the monster was just small, seeing it's mother killed.   <br/><br/>If you're just making a system to resolve questions, that has no attempt to show story, it's gonna fall flat.  <br/><br/>It's why Pandemic is a shitty rpg.  It's the opposite of story.  It removes the human drama, through distance and distillation.                     </div>

                            Good post, Nathan.<br/><br/>I believe that, in the original discussion, I posted some examples of an algorithmic process of monster motivation, but it's hard to do.<br/><br/>It all depends on what kind of game you're playing. If story is the goal, then the who and the why are intertwined (e.g. Frodo gets attacked just because he is carrying the Ring, perhaps).                        </div>

<p>Nathan darling if you do call out threads to me please put <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> in so I can see them faster♥</p><p>I’m not gonna go into how our group has had some amazing RPG sessions with Pandemic (we have! and it revived our group after a slump) but instead address the core question raised here. This is partially on me because I didn’t explicitly address your <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/481264/#Comment_481264" rel="nofollow">March 23 post</a>.</p><p>But I’m glad it’s in a separate thread now. Let’s dig in.</p><p>It sometimes happens that only one hero is fighting a monster, or is being fought by a monster. That happened last session. The monster had a very clear diegetic reason to focus on that hero and it was obvious to everyone at the table. And so that’s what happened. (It feels weird to write “monster” on here since my name for them at our table is “pretty”, as in “fly my pretties”.)</p><p>We do have a human DM in order to adjudicate special situations like that.</p><p>Such special situations happen less than 1 out of 30 fights. Or less than 1 out of 100. It’s happened maybe three times over these last 50 sessions.</p><ol><li>The monsters were after a book that one PC had</li><li>The monsters were after those who had entered a particular dwelling and only two PCs had</li><li>The monsters were attacked by one PC to the shock &amp; surprise of the other PCs</li></ol><p>What are the more common reasons the monster attack?</p><ul><li>Most common reason: Because they want to protect themselves or their dwelling or their master’s dwelling from the murderous hobos</li><li>Second most common reason: Because they eat people and the hobos are, for the most part, people.</li></ul><p>Both of these common reasons usually lead to more than one hero qualifying for attack. Then we need a disambiguation protocol for who they attack.</p><p>Stories…</p><p>It’s not my job at the table to write stories. For a while we were using Microscope Chronicle to explore the previous history of magical weapons and such which would then tie back into the main game. That was awesome and, again, would lead to these rare special situations where it’s clear to everyone why a monster has a particular target as their first priority. But even then it affected a very small percentage of fights.</p><p>Now, in the first two versions of my monster-target-selection protocol this wasn’t explicitly addressed. Any rule can get overridden by the SIS. If so, I do it in consultation with the table.</p><p>The third (and currently most recent) version that I did last monday does have a “special” column where these kinds of special exceptions can be explicitly and openly addressed.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you’re just making a system to resolve questions, that has no attempt to show story, it’s gonna fall flat</p></div></blockquote><p>That’s what the system is. A consequence engine. It’s there to resolve questions. That’s why I call it “the guns on the table”. We are creating story and if none of us are reaching for the guns, <em>that’s fine</em>. That happens often. But when we <em>do</em> reach for them, they better be well-oiled, functional, and not dependent on me making up new facts. It is a rule in our group that the DM shall strive to not introduce new facts to the game world once it is set in motion. C.f. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">mirror story</a>.</p><p>“Hey, that Flame Tongue Sword you have… this skeleton’s mom was killed by it!” ← <strong>awesome</strong> if true and will ofc influence the battle. In v1 and v2 as obvious exceptions, in v3 as a checkmark in the special column. But introducing such facts <strong>post-hoc</strong> is not part of our process. . We run “full myth”.</p><p>So the reason I didn’t give your original post its full due response was that the question I was asking was this:</p><p><strong>When there is a lack of clarity</strong> over who the monsters attack, who do they attack?</p><p>And your response was pretty much “Sometimes there is clarity”.</p><p>Or, “Introduce a clarity by writing story”. Which, by design, isn’t part of our process. The table action is the story. All week I’ve been telling people I meet in my daily life about what happened in our game last friday because it was so awesome. And that’s almost every week because the game… <em>creates</em> story.</p><p>It just so happens that two of the heroes’ young son was killed during the game. Not as a pre-story or pre-planned or railroaded thing. He just died in a fight. (He got tossed into a volcano by dancing fungi.) And now that’s a big part of their motivation, trying to find a way to resurrect him. Monkey’s paw style. ♫I don’t wanna be buried…♫</p><p>Rather than the game being a collection of stories that I came up with, our game is a world where stories <em>happen</em> and the mechanics are there to support it being a world of physics and consequence and weight.</p><p><small>I also do write novels and comics and put on my web page. That’s my outlet for my story ideas instead of taking it out on the group. But those novels and comics suck compared to our game!</small></p><p>Any questions?</p> </div>

Guy♥♥♥♥<br/>That's a great &amp; much appreciated summary: if there is a story reason then that's what they go with. If there isn't, then protocol to resolve.<br/><br/>But one nitpick: the procedure isn't making them smarter, it's limiting them. Before the protocol the monsters were devilishly smart in a suicidal, living-bullet way. They focus-fired AF, and they weren't switching targets as often (which triggers opportunity attacks i.e. bad action econ for them). The protocol was put in place to <i>limit</i> them rather than to enhance them. That's why a large part of the protocol is limiting targets (via TOR-inspired "they primarily go for one front-rank hero each" <small>[because they'd reasonably <b>have</b> to, that's how battles are formed, lest they'd leave their backs open]</small>) and only part of the protocol is prioritizing targets (via DU-inspired "they punish backstabbers" and similar). With that in mind, the protocol isn't them being stupid either. It's more a way to add some texture to the battlefield. Since we were doing TotM we had a "anyone can target anyone" problem but with these protocols there are ranks and lines forming. Which is great, paints a way vidider picture.                        </div>

                            So, the monsters that I like, that have moved me, made me "lean into" a role-playing game, or into a story, have been monsters that had obvious contradictions.  I mean, if you don't feel somewhat bad for a monster, it's not doing it's job.  Or at least, not all of it's job.  <br/><br/>I'm of the school, using your gun analogy, that if a guns on a table, people are gonna use it.  <br/>People, generally speaking, are lazy.  <br/><br/>It takes work, maybe playful work, and certainly time,  to make up a  good enough lie to explain a new development.   <br/><br/>I could make a whole post about monsters and what makes a meaningful monster and what makes a meaningless monster.  <br/>I don't think a system is gonna change a meaningless monster, into a meaningful monster.  <br/>Unless you call cause and effect a system?  <br/><br/>If a monster's just there so that players have something to do, it's being poorly used.  I would imagine you would have to ask yourself why, and that answer will most often be because I was lazy, or in a hurry.  Which is understandable.  But if it's got no purpose, a system isn't gonna give it much of one.  In my opinion.  I mean, this is all my opinion.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">@Nathan_H</a>  Maybe in darwinian sandboxes, monsters are part of the eco-system. You know how they are convenient to grind resources away from adventurers. Also, sometimes, they are resources themselves. They are not characters hired by the local rangers to warn you about wildlife and its dangers, they are real. I guess that's the intent.<br/>But I agree, for me valid NPC have their own goals. That is, once they have their goals, they're no longer a burden to animate.                        </div>

                            This is a basic question of "what's our creative goal here?", isn't it? Like, why are we playing this game, and why do we have a fight with a monster?<br/><br/>If it's fable about the creation of the world, "who does the monster attack?" could mean EVERYTHING ("...and then the beast turned on Adam, for he represented the Creator, whom the beast envied..."), or it could be completely unimportant (just colour, in other words, because the monster represents raw chaos in our story).<br/><br/>If it's a tactical battlegrid combat, it could be really key (because the game's design is supposed to pit the GM's wits against the players) or better left to some algorithm (because the GM is supposed to be as impartial as possible).<br/><br/>And so on.                        </div>

True. When I started Dracula Dossier, at the end of one session, the 4 PCs decided to split up and go in four different directions. I had each of them get attacked because I knew I would never get this chance again. It wasn't any deeper than that, to begin with.<br/><br/>After the session, I looked at who had been attacked by whom / what, and then found reasons that it all made sense (to my surprise, I could actually do that). This worked because of the kind of sandbox that is Dracula Dossier. I don't claim it's my best gming, but it sometimes works surprisingly well. I suspect this is because the PCs and players don't spend a lot of time during the attack stopping to wonder why. I mean, afterwards? Sure, they discuss it, and then it occurs to me that a reason other than "the players gave me an opening" would be a Really Good Idea, but no one seems to mind their PC the focus of an action scene.<br/><br/>I don't run every game that way -- usually, I try to overthink and overplot on the grounds that this is how I keep up with players. And even here, the attackers didn't come out of the void or a random encounter table (not that I mind those, you understand). I had the stats on hand and a very vague idea that these existed. I just didn't think about the why or how of it all (well, not beyond "Public bathhouse? Okay, mentally ensorcelled man with a knife. In his home? Carmilla's latest "mother".")                        </div>

Whereas I journeyed in the other direction, being late to the party on D&amp;D but finding it really clicked.

In my experience D&amp;D scratches that itch better. We used to play Magic &amp; Netrunner but now it's D&amp;D all the time.<br/><br/>1. It's open source meaning we can keep on building on it &amp; improving it. Really fun &amp; also makes the game an increasingly good fit for us / me. Not that I don't have house rules for Magic. I guess I'm just a rules B.<br/>2. M I R R O R   S T O R Y<br/>I was in tears of joy, I called my mom, I felt like I finally "got it". This was what I had been searching for since I first saw an RPG back in 1992.<br/><br/>Phase 1. Did not understand the games (a Runequest clone) — to complicated &amp; no instructions on how to prep. Me, my sister and our girlfriends making characters but then never could actually start the game. My mom ran one game for us, that was fun.<br/>Phase 2. Discovered Everway, Fudge and SLUG. And Usenet. Finally got some games in! At first pretty bad since I was running for guys and they wanted me to play sexy NPCs giving them sponge baths…?!?! Goodbye to those guys pretty quick. Then found some players I liked more. Made some great games, at this point I was playing super rules light or w a very stripped down Fudge. Player retention/interest wasn't great, getting a game together was a rare occasion, 2, 3 times per year maybe. The problem was it was all DM fiat, DM making things up on the fly or a preconceived idea, since we were playing in a very identifying-stance way everything they said or did was what the character said or did, leaving not much room for story idea contributions. The stories were all mine and we had some players loving them but… it was pretty much smoke &amp; mirrors.<br/>Phase 3. Trying to find good rules! Having fun with story games, kinda struggling a bit with Fate (since I was into Fudge I discovered Fate pretty much day 1 but it never clicked for us)<br/>Phase 4. Discovered D&amp;D!!! &amp; the joy of precommitted world facts.<br/><br/>Bitter over wasting two decades before "getting it" but… it's great now!<br/>Last session yesterday was another mirror-story-esque situation with lots of "physics" and weird magic items and traps to interact with and explore.

Yeah, that's interesting! I have learned that everyone — <i>everyone</i> needs stats because I never know how they're gonna attack. They threw an ice storm spell at a little princess girl the other day for crying out loud! Whereas some of their best friends as NPCs were people I put in there as bad guys &amp; antagonists but they were like "OK we like this guy! We're gonna hire him!"<br/><br/> </div>

Paul, I don't buy into that.  There are better carriers.  I'll use a deviled eggs analogy.  I could just place deviled eggs, all loose-like, tossing them into the trunk of my car, and transport them to where ever I'm going with this analogy, or I can put them in a container, that's made to transport food from your house, to another house without damage. <br/><br/>Sure, you can use it, but it might be easier to use something made for what you're doing.  <br/><br/>If it doesn't matter(random), then why does it matter?  It matters because something has clicked.  You've gotten a bit of inspiration from this somewhat random, somewhat predetermined thing.<br/><br/>I don't buy into the "ends justifies the means", not that I think this is what this is exactly, but if you follow a similar train of thought, it could be.   Can we agree that people create without needing to roll dice or consult pre-written tables?   <br/><br/>"A simple example might be a system where you roll who the monster attacks randomly, and you roll the same PC three times in a row.

                            Kevin Crawford's Godbound has a nice semi-random element in his monster encounters (I know I've seen it elsewhere, too), in that different monsters have different strategy tables. <br/><br/>This is a simple d6 table with different actions for each result, like so: <br/>1-attack the weakest looking opponent in the front row<br/>2-try to attack whoever looks like a spell caster<br/>3-fall back and lead the enemy into a trap or ambush<br/>4-try to bring a more powerful ally into the fight, etc.<br/><br/>For the more powerful and magical creatures, the 5's and 6's are usually cues for the monster to use an area attack or buff itself with a magical effect.  <br/><br/>I have found this to be a nice compromise between making sense of encounters and being unpredictable.  Honestly, my brainpower is limited when running games and I'm very happy to delegate questions like this to a randomizer.  <br/><br/>Sure, if it's a goblin hit squad trying to avenge the insult the Thief character made to their Queen during the last session, then it requires more thought.  But I almost always elevate NPC's after the fact.  If the heroes kill five goblins and one of them gets away, that's the one that gets a name and becomes a recurring figure in the game.  If I choose the significant figure ahead of time, the PC's are guaranteed to kill them, every time.                        </div>

Some people like it more. It has a different feel than coming up with everything yourself. wildbow, author of Worm, arguably the best web serial on the internet (arguably <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>), has literally rolled dice to determine who lives and who dies.<br/><br/>You don't like authoring stories that way, that's very clear. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> But it's not some kind of intrinsically worse method, it's just that you don't like it and for you it's always worse than the alternative. Which is fine. For you.                        </div>

                            And that's why I cooked up the "who does the monsters attack" system (with the help of the sources I copied from).

                            Nathan,<br/><br/>There are lots of reasons to prefer random procedures to non-random procedures. For instance, take this procedure:<br/><br/>* Sit down together, and brainstorm a genre you'd like to play in. Try to come up with some examples of stuff that works well in this genre, until you're all on the same page.<br/>* For the player on your left and on your right, come up with an interesting relationship between your characters.<br/>* Next, think of an interesting item or location for this genre, and place it between two players.<br/>* Also come up with an interesting "need" for this genre, something that could motivate someone, and put that between two different players.<br/><br/>Or, you could pick a Fiasco playset, and roll dice, and you have everything ready.<br/><br/>Can you see why someone might prefer the latter over the former?<br/><br/>Some obvious features are:<br/><br/>* It's easier and more convenient.<br/>* It prevents creative block and helps resolve disagreements between players about genre.<br/>* It's much faster.<br/>* It may have content that's better than what your group could come up with on their own.<br/>* It will create unexpected combinations, which can break you out of a creative rut and force you to come up with something you normally would never think of...<br/>* Etc.<br/><br/>I think there's plenty of value at all points along this spectrum, personally. Just need the right tool for the right game and the right group and the right circumstances!                        </div>

I have never played Fiasco without some creative editing.  It's never been that easy sounding.  Look, I'm thanked in the book, twice, but Set-up hasn't always gone smoothly, and I err on the side of story.  Sometimes it takes a couple turns 'til relationship pairings flesh out, sometimes they flip-flop.  <br/><br/>Fiasco isn't the end all be all, nor does it magically arrive at fun, for everyone, always.  Sometimes the Tilts feel wrong.  Sometimes the game doesn't reflect what happened in the story.  <br/><br/>Yes, having something to reference can be helpful, but it isn't always.  You guys act like having rules means having fun, and those two things are usually very separate.  <br/><br/> </div>

The points you list as positives, could also be seen as negatives.  And I'm not sure that having rules helps you get there and "faster" or "better".<br/><br/>When I would play music improvisationally, it can be sometimes best to not come with anything beforehand.  Sometimes relying on a structure, previously made, without any connection to what's going on, the relationships currently between the people playing music, has just felt like a bump.  It'd usually the first thing to go, those expectations that had nothing to do with the current thing.  <br/><br/>It's just a different perspective.   I do like games, but only so much.  Rules can focus and blind.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            Oh, absolutely. There are also many downsides to rule-based constraints. It's always a balancing act, and sometimes you want to explore one end of the spectrum and sometimes the other.<br/><br/>We're in total agreement there. <br/><br/>An easy example of that:<br/><br/>When a famous writer sits down to write their next novel, they don't (generally) reach for dice and a fiasco playset.<br/><br/>But for a group of strangers playing on a strict three-hour timeline, it can be very handy. <br/><br/>I'm not making an argument that any particular way is better.<br/><br/>To bring it back to the original topic:<br/><br/>My personal preference is to know a strong "why" for each monster, so they have a purpose, both tactically and thematically. Careful chosen ad crafted for maximum impact. That tends to be far more interesting and satisfying than any alternative.<br/><br/>However, there are many games and gaming contexts where a random table or a simple algorithm might suit what we're doing better.<br/> </div>

I don't let the math get in the way of the heart.  Passion should come first, then technique, and finally theory.  It's like love and bravery - love isn't shit without it.  If you don't first feel something, it's pointless.  <br/><br/>I like instruments with less going on, so that more of me can get in there.  <br/><br/>I get it, forms have preconceptions.  Guitar music sounds a lot like guitar music.<br/><br/>I do like some continuous pitch instruments, but even they have their own rules.  <br/><br/>I've been known to play a duck call, with my finger, pulling the end off, and pressing the little metal tine with my finger.  It sounds like a little weird saxophone.  <br/>You have to turn it around, and draw breath(suck) into the typically-end-now-mouthpiece.                        </div>

                            I guess I shouldn't have gone too deep in the analogy like that. I appreciate your patience with that, thank you.♥<br/><br/>What I should've said is that my role as GM is to be the world, not the author.<br/>Stories happen through the PCs actions &amp; experiences rather than their, or my, narration.<br/>It's very much a story game but… the story… this isn't ouijaboarding, it does work. It does just emerge. It's not authored, not at the table.<br/><br/>That's the fundamental rule that makes everything else tick in what I'm doing.

I don't think we're even doing the same thing in different ways. The activities we are doing are fundamentally and incompatibly different. It's like comparing a car ride to a cake-eating contest.. All fun things to do, but completely different things.<br/><br/>You're right in that the conversation is also kinda pointless. There is no minor change that can turn what I'm doing into what you're doing or vice versa.<br/><br/>I think we're trapped in some sorta "want to have the last word" loop, or maybe it's just me that kinda am. Because I did feel like you sorta jumped into my "here I'm gonna design some mechanics that fits in right with the other ones I've got"  thread and were like "duh, why don't you just create more of a story for each monster" and it'd be like I'm tryna bake a cake and you're like "OK I drive cars that's similar and here's some gasoline, add that to your dough and it'll really go".<br/><br/>Your game sounds really cool but it's so far from what I'm doing.<br/><br/>The entire rules, structure, music notes analogy was a dead end and I fucked up leaning into it. It's more like… a holodeck or a theme park or or just a big ol forest on the one hand, or a movie or a song or a novel or a play on the other.<br/><br/>I have a hard time letting the topic go because it's something that I wish I understood a long time ago and I wish I knew how to explain it. Maybe you already understand the type of gameplay I'm talking about and you've moved on from it; it's just that we're not finding the words to communicate or verify that that's the case.<br/><br/>When the mirror story happened I was like…<br/>"Oh, so <b>this</b> is a roleplaying game!" That was after having been active running and playing and writing about it for 2 decades. You probably have even more experience, not trying to appeal to my own "authority" or whatever. Just trying to say that… the uh… the whatever the mirror story was / is, was something that I had not understood before it happened. Rereading other texts about roleplaying, I can see that some of them hint to the same sort of gameplay, it's just that I misunderstood them and couldn't get what they were about until I had had my own satōri kick.<br/><br/>As a player of games like Zork, Choose Your Own Adventure, Fighting Fantasy or whatever, even reading fucking Robin's Laws <small>[as much as I love Hillfolk and HHP, Robin's Laws is garbage. Sorry Robin if you're reading this but it's prob one of the worst books I've read]</small> I thought "OK, A GM presents a sequence of scenes, this happens then this happens than this happens. The more generous&amp;ambitious the GM, the more branches off that trunk there are. But instead I'll just learn to improvise."<br/>I still had a "events happen" mindset. I'd see a module with dungeons &amp; rooms and I'd still be like "OK, first they come to this room, then they come to this room, then they can choose between room A and room B..."<br/>When the mirror story happened and I realized that… we were in a tangible, consistent, solid <i>world</i> that was more than the story created in the moment, that was a place we had visited for real, through our words and through the DM's words…<br/><br/>Guh, I'm not tryna convince you to change your ways. Just… it's like if you were to ask about <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21992/sit-down-pretend-without-scene-action-resolution#latest" rel="nofollow">Sit-Down Pretend Without Scene/Action Resolution</a> and I'd answer "Oh, just use GURPS and do a Quick Contest using the rules on page B348". That's not what your question was about.<br/><br/>And you fundamentally did not understand what my question was about.<br/>It was about "who <b>does</b> the monster attack". On their <i>own</i>. Once I've wound up the little spring inside and let them loose. Not "who can I come up with a fake reason why they attack someone and then have them attack that person."<br/>Because the reason would be fake and cheating given the premise of the activity I'm doing. It's not fake nor cheating in a story narration yarn spinning exercise. In fact, it's super cool there. That goes back to the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21073/four-mirror-scenarios-and-two-groups/p1" rel="nofollow">four mirror scenarios and two groups</a> thing. What's bad in one is great in the other. And vice versa. And both activities are super fun. I dearly love both. There can even be mixes of them. Like, this part of the game is this kind of game, that part of the game is that kinda game. "On the ship we get to tell improvised tales of space adventure but once combat starts it's no more improvisation." Or vice versa or w/e.                        </div>

Ooo ooo ooo, I can answer this.  <br/>I mean, it all depends on what I'm doing but I will assume you're asking about me playing role-playing games with old friends.   I verbalize more of these things with people I've not played pretend with, than with people I have.  I think that's probably common, but I brought it up anyway.   <br/><br/>I might address theme in a round-about sort of way, before worrying about characters.  I don't do this with any level of professionalism.  What kind of almost-story do we want to tell?  Where?  What does it feel like?  Sometimes I'll just ask what game they want to play, but I don't stop asking questions after that.  I mean, at some point I stop asking questions, but not yet.<br/><br/>Well, I do like characters that contrast one another.  Ones with opposing lives and perspectives.  So, I like player characters to contrast, compliment one another.  I mean, the easiest way to show who a character is, is to contrast it by it's opposite.  I'm using the term opposite loosely here, but I assume you get the point.  <br/><br/>The dance of contrasts.  <br/><br/>I think dice are used as deciders because of their innocuousness.  I mean, who can argue with a simple oracle.   I think they're relied upon a it too much for creating mystery and surprise.  I guess what I'm saying is I don't find dice to be that constructive of a constraint.  They're a fuzzy petition to an authority.   Fuzzy might not be the right word, but they're a petition with varying, somewhat chaotic weight.  <br/><br/>There are constraints in life.  You don't need a rules to have them.  Creating an idea-thing has it's own boundaries too.<br/><br/>Well, games can be magical.  I think Hide and Go Seek is strangely perfect.  I'm not sure if you could create that sort of mood, that real-feeling-fake-fear, without rules?   But you don't use Hide and Go Seek to tell something that sort of resembles a story.  I'm sure you could, but it might not have the hallmarks of one without some editing.  <br/><br/>I think human intuition might be better at consistency than you're maybe willing to give it?  People are creatures of habit.  We tend to fall into patterns.  If patterns aren't consistency, than I don't know what is?<br/><br/>I like constraints, but I tend to make enough for myself.  The idea has it's own boundaries.  There's an honesty to just following cause and effect.<br/><br/> </div>

Oh, it's fine.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're allowed to have an opinion.<br/>You can play games however you like, as long as no ones breaking any laws.                        </div>

                            Good answers (although you didn't afraid my precise question - basically, whether you use any rulesets at all, and, if so, what value they bring you)!<br/><br/>I'll happily disagree with you about consistency - humans are biased creatures and it's very hard to ignore those biases. Most of our rules and laws and structures are about enforcing consistency (without law being upheld, an authority figure would almost never punish transgressors consistently, for example - family members might get preferential treatment, better looking people might as well, and so might certain ethnic groups, etc).<br/><br/>Same goes for "will this activity be the same when a different group plays?", and others potential concerns.<br/><br/>I do think that playing with the same group of friends allows us to treat many of these structures and constraints as known - unspoken rules and traditions. <br/><br/>If you're happy playing by the unwritten rules in your head, and you have the authority to enforce those (or at least have them addressed) in your group, then you arguably don't need a ruleset at all. <br/><br/>Making procedures becomes much more important when communicating those to other humans is a priority - for instance, when you play with strangers often or want to teach someone else to GM in your style.                         </div>

Remember that time we played Hide and Seek in the city and I crawled under a gate to hide in some stranger's yard? I was more afraid that <i>they</i> would catch me than you.<br/><br/>With games of this nature, games with rules... we *live* the story.<br/><br/>This is why I speak of "buy-in" where others might speak of immersion.

And I've outlined some of the rules that pretend has made for me to be able to run a game that don't make the pretend all fall apart. For me. "Let's pretend the floor is lava." "Oh cool! But why are you standing there?" "Oh this exact part of the floor (points to exactly the same kind of floor no different floor tile color or carpet or anything) isn't lava."<br/><br/>This is also why pre-committed world facts are such a key ingredient in what I find awesome. If there was a note in your pocket, signed&amp;sealed yesterday, saying "the floor under me, whereever I go, isn't lava", then cool. If you're changing the rules on me on the fly, then not cool.<br/><br/>If you select rock after seeing me select scissors, that's not cool.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

Sure, that's close enough.</div></blockquote>
None.  Does anyone play a role-playing game as it's actually written, maybe other than the person or people who wrote it?  They're not like checkers or chess.  <br/><br/>When I play Fiasco, I often ignore the Aftermath, maybe because it feels unnecessary by that point?  Sometimes it's nice to have that "where are they now" montage, but oftentimes it doesn't gel with what was going on at the table.  <br/>Even after Set-up, Relationship parings might flip-flop, depending on those first couple scenes.<br/> </div>

In your example, you have something that makes story - that status play of maker of rules - bender of rules.  That's story, and you wanna get rid of it for egalitarian reasons(the McDonalds of reasons - consistency). You have drama.  Two people want something different(everything is lava because I say it is/this part isn't lava because I say it is).  <br/> </div>

                            Nathan,<br/><br/>I don't much care if you play any game as written (I deliberately omitted that part from my quote, in fact). I'm just curious what value you see in using a ruleset at all, given then stance you've been promoting here. Why bother with rules and procedures at all?                        </div>

Story obv means different things in different kinds of games &amp; we are in semantics land.<br/>I feel you are staring at the finger right now and missing the heavily glory of an adventurous world where there floor actually is lava.<br/><br/><b>I feel that you aren't getting me or my point at all.</b> And that's on me for not being able to explain it well enough. Maybe I'm not getting you either. I'll try to do my best effort to try to understand you or try to express my current understanding of what your saying. The underlying <i>signifié</i> you are using the NP "story" to represent is something that I associate with "things that sound cool", "it would be awesome if", "once upon a time a kid changed the rules in a lava game and that was a cool story", "once upon a time a skeleton was killed by the Blackblade and it wanted to take vengeance on the sword's new owner". Narrative, a sort of oral literature. Myth structures, dramatic irony or drama or comedy or tragedy or…<br/>things that make sense as story units.<br/><br/>What I have on offer is something different. You don't have to take the apple, you don't have to change your ways. You're not even obligated to keep hearing me out or keep up this conversation or keep reading this post. I get that.<br/>I just keep writing because I'm frustrated that I can't express what I mean in an understable way, or, if you have already understood it, that <b>I</b> in my ignorance (if that's the case) is unable to understand or see that you have.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is the difference between a cool story and a <b>true</b> story.<br/><br/>In the mirror story we went into a cold room. Hitting every tile with our ten-foots. Carefully checking the ceiling for spiders. We went up to a vertical plane covered in thick moldy yellow curtains. Some sorta board, or painting? We touched under it. It was glass. Maybe a mirror… but why the covering? Just dust? In this dungeon we have lost so many lives from reading cursed books and tablets. We dare not look into this mirror. But… we'll fasten it to our wagon, with the curtain still on… it can be a fantastic weapon, we thought. And then later we fought The Toad Beasts. And we yoinked off the cloth and one of the beings looked at the glass surface underneath and  p o p p e d  out of existence. For it was indeed a mirror trap. This wasn't a story we heard. This wasn't a story we told around the camp fire. This was our story — not a story we created, it was a story we lived, a deed we perfomed.<br/><br/>If this had been a DM who was willing to "create stories" at the table, this is how it might've gone. "OK, they've made their way through the portcullis, what's cool to put in here… uh… some sorta… [looks around RPG playing room] yellow curtain is cool. yeah. yellow curtain. Ok, now they said they're touching behind it. It's... curtain, window… 'you feel glass you guys!!!'. OK now they seem to believe it's a magic mirror, the imagination on them smh smh. But ok that might actually be pretty cool, wonder what the effect should be… nothing too dangerous. What, they fastened it to their wagon? That's unexpected but ok. [2 hours later] They pulled off the curtain and exposed the mirror to the giant toads? It's, uh, let's say that they can kill one toad with it, that sounds about fair. I can always add more HP to the remaining toads if the rest of the fight becomes too easy. Besides, rule of cool says I should give them this one. 'One toad disappear with a pop'. OK, maybe they'll just turn it to the next one, I better add 'and then the mirror cracks!'" <big><b><i>← that would've sucked!!</i></b></big> Completely invalidating what we were doing, which was... we believed in the world. We believed in the portcullis, the curtain, the mirror, the wagon, the toads.<br/><br/>Instead, what happened was <b>awesome</b>. The room <i>had</i> curtains and a magic mirror — that's in writing, and our DM just had to refer back to it — and we <i>did</i> fasten it to our wagon. Your rock <i>did</i> beat my scissors. The floor <i>was</i> lava.<br/><br/><br/>Btw, to Paul. I believe you are trying to be like "so do you see any value in any rules" to catch Nathan saying something like "ok one time we kinda did use this one rule" so you cango "aha! so you <b>do</b> admit rules can be good" or something and that's just… Nathan please don't think I'm arguing in that way as well. I mean I accidentally with the music analogy but I regretted it. This sorta Phoenix Wright, Mark Anthony trying to "catch people out" rhetoric isn't my jam♥

                            (Oh, I'm not trying to "catch anyone out", not at all. Honestly curious what Nathan sees as the purpose and rules in collaborative story creation; his posts so far seem to suggest that breaking rules is always better. I don't know if that's what he actually thinks, or not! For myself, I believe there is always a fruitful tension between proceduralism and instinctual play - I see benefits on both sides, just in different ways.)                        </div>

                            I thought I explained this well enough, but I guess I didn't?  <br/>Did you read everything I wrote in this discussion?  <br/>You have to have <b>rules</b> first, in order to break them.  So, I'm a fan of both, in the right situation.  <br/><br/>I'm sure I've written this in the discussion, but I'll write it again, the main purpose of rules, in role-playing games is for everyone to be in somewhat agreement... hopefully.  That's a big hopefully.  I don't know where in 5th Edition D&amp;D, it tells players to put away their fucking phones, and pay attention?  I imagine it does, or at least hints at it.<br/><br/>Procedure is just someone else's way of doing things.  When I cook dinner, using a new recipe, I'll follow it as best I can, if I have all the ingredients, fairly literally.  As I get to know the recipe, the more times I make it, I change things up.   Maybe I won't have everything that the recipe calls for one night?  Do you cook the same thing every night? <br/><br/>Were did I write that breaking rules is always better?  Can you quote me please?<br/><br/>I don't think role-playing games are that great for "collaborative story creation".  I can't be the only one who thinks that they make pretty shitty stories?   The experience can be enjoyable(even great), but they ain't Moby Dick.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>

I think that if you started this thread because you're genuinely interested in understanding why a "who does the monster attack" algorithm is a good thing, the best way to get there is by answering the questions I quoted, and then finding our way to how they improve play.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you're not looking for a discussion but stating a preference, that's cool too. I prefer monsters with a clear "why", as well, when possible. With you on that one!                        </div>

Well, me to obv. <b>When possible.</b> Given that the party is a bunch of horrible murder hobos that's not always possible. They start throwing rocks a bunch of skeletons; the skeletons fight back; does Drooma, Samu, Ashinell or Ran get the first arrow, mechanically?
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you're just making a system to resolve questions, that has no attempt to show story, it's gonna fall flat.</p></div></blockquote>
But the system I did cook up to resolve the questions have [thin as they may be] ties to the SIS. The heuristics that I put in place would give out these results: they'd see this one-armed, bearded dwarve travelling with a bunch of hin and their first instinct would be to shoot at the dwarve. These puny hin can't be that dangerous. But once Samu uses his dread ambusher training to dish out some extra damage, the skellies would want to put him down. That is, until Ran pops off some of their magic missiles, making them the skeleton's number 1 enemy; but by now the groups have closed in on each other in a mêlée and Ran is in the back rank and hard to reach. It's still between Samu, Drooma and Ashinell — the latter hasn't done anything yet, but there are three skeletons so they go for the three front rank PCs, not wanting to leave their backs open. Swords clash until a skeleton gets in a clean hit on Drooma, and the pain from his broken ribs causes him to pass out. Now, Samu and Ashinell could shift their guard over to protect him, but maybe they don't want to lose out on Ran's firepower so instead they continue to guard them. Ran followed by Samu are still the most attractive targets because of their high damage output, but Drooma's unconscious body presents a golden opportunity as well, leaving him still a higher priority than Ashinell; however, Ashinell is still in the front rank so a skeleton keeps fighting her and another fighting Samu. However, the last skeleton keeps stabbing at Drooma who is now at death's door.<br/><br/>The system I cooked up [and yes, Wizardry, via The One Ring, deserves most of the credit, and then Dragon Union] isn't just "roll 1d4 labeled D, S, A, R." You referred to this detail as detracting from the premise and falling flat. I don't think it falls flat at all. It's awesome. I have to solve a freaking sudoku-style puzzle every fight in order to untangle all the priorities and sometimes I make mistakes but that's fun too.<br/><br/>At our table, player characters can die. I don't decide who lives or dies. I don't decide the premise and I don't set the pace. In fact, my job is to <i>not</i> do that. Among all the participants at the table, my role as referee makes me the one who is <i>least</i> allowed to do that.                        </div>

                            From a Theme driven perspective, the Algorithm of Combat Sorting is what we don't want in a game, because survival of the fittest is the poorest sort of stories and death by mere bad luck is not very dramatic.<br/>I understand it is a responsibility buffer for a strict murdering game. But what about hybrid forms of games ?

                            The way to make a hybrid game work, even across opposite corners of <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/riss/" rel="nofollow">RISS official, canonical theory</a>, is to clearly delineate which aspects of the game are run under which corner.<br/><br/>Either PC life&amp;death is under the auspices of The Algorithm or it isn't. If it is, it is wholly so.<br/>Here follows some jolly good examples of hybrid experiences.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard.</b> Yes, I know that the game has been deleted (and I applaud <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> for doing so♥) but it's the example that came to mind. PCs can die because of fallout; fallout appears through addressing of theme.<br/><br/><b>Hillfolk</b> recommends you graft another system on to it in order to handle procedural scenes (it suggest WaRP — we ofc use D&amp;D), but it does come with its own sorta crappy playing cards &amp; beads system where NPCs and monsters can be pointlessly murdered for some excitement &amp; risk but PCs can't really die, they can only suffer dramatic consequences that make them even more cool &amp; brooding. (Until the last session.)<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> a PC can die during the shenanigans (such as killed by other PCs) and the intent is that it's always in a way that addresses the theme of the game. And they can live on in Flashbacks or through other means of lingering on in the story via memories or schemes, as their players become scene-setters.<br/><br/><b>Microscope</b> [explicitly isn't an adventure game, but also] has shared ownership of characters so they aren't really PCs in that way. It's fine if it's a bit fuzzy and "let's just vote via pointing fingers" (or via playing cards in the case of <b>Final Girl</b>, a game similar to Microscope).<br/><br/><b>Cthulhu Dark</b>, while it is an adventure game, is set up mechanically so that actions such as "I try to run away from the shoggoths before they eat me" or "I try to kill the cultists in a life-or-death struggle" is A. conflict-level resolution, B. player-initiated, C. clear stakes&amp;intent, D. mechanically set up so that you can roll &amp; re-roll trying to survive and if you choose to do try to that but still ultimately fail, your character's fate is in away that's in harmony with the dramatic&amp;literate theme of the game, which is to say gaining ultimate insight into the workings of cosmos&amp;chaos.<br/><br/>Notably absent from this list are <b>Apocalypse World</b>, <b>Dungeon World</b> and <b>Blades in the Dark</b>, neotrad games that have enough of an adventure game vibe that I'd want an algorithm similar to the one I have set up for D&amp;D before I'd feel comfortable running them again. But wait! There <i>is</i> already an algorithm for that family of games! Look through crosshairs, announce future badness, split them up etc etc. The algorithm has more gaps-for-subjectivity than mine, but mine also has a non-zero amount (what if there are TWO dwarven fighters in the front rank who both have the "restrained condition" and who both have cast the exact same spells (as each other) this fight).<br/>So obv I'm in good company wanting to cook up an algo for these things♥                        </div>

                            Thank you : I was thinking of this latter category and you answered for much more. What I can take away is that these "neotrad" games work with vaguer broader terms, and you came up with terms more adjusted to your experience  (party, encounter, mobility, etc.) This speaks for the number of "survivalist" combat encounters in your game.                        </div>

                            I guess one of the snafus in the convo is that… of <i>course</i> there's always a <b>why</b>. It's just that since the PCs are in a party they often act as, and fight as, one, and the amount of detail of where specific attacks are directed, and in what order, is often important given the resolution level of the ruleset we're using.<br/><br/>The party got attacked by snakes because they walked in the jungle. The party attacked a princess because they thought she was in leage with their boss' enemy. The party attacked some snake people because they wanted to steal a Maguffin from them. The party hunted down and attacked a boar because they wanted to eat boar meat. There's always a because and the because is almost never enough to answer the question to the degree of detail that we use.                        </div>

                            Interesting, Sandra!<br/><br/>How do you handle trying to protect an ally from missile fire? Impossible? By declaration only if the fiction permits?<br/><br/>Also, if your monsters use character classes to determine targets, does this ever affect party composition? (Like, “oh, man! Can you join our party and make a paladin? Otherwise my archer will get clobbered first every time?” Or even, “My character concept is a cleric, but I just remembered that means I’d be first in the line of fire in our group, so I’d better make sure I have high Con and good armour...”?)<br/><br/>I’m very confused by your comments about AW. You seem to be saying that the game(s) often struggle with this problem (which implies you think they would be improved by an algorithm), but then seem to be saying that the game does have an algorithm in its own way.<br/><br/>So maybe I’ll just ask this: what kind of problem have you seen? Can you give an example I what this looks like in play? (Ideally I’d love to see a link to it happening in an online, streamed game, but that might be too hard to find, I realize!)                        </div>

                            What I've seen happen in trad and neo games are fights with goons and a few hitters, attacking the party, and distributing in a balanced way. Like, very often they are not here to be efficient, but to bring meat to the grinder. That happens more often when the party is identified as one entity, and it doesn't make it a better strategy. It's not so frequent in games like AW where there may be no party to speak of.                         </div>

In hindsight it's great, I can use their insights to make it better.<br/><br/>But yeah, it was difficult. It had been fun with them knowing that the monsters had a mind of their own but not knowing exactly how that mind ticked. But I had promised to make v1 public as soon as I made a version 2. Then when I did make a version 2 I thought "hey, I might as well talk to them about the new version too". We're just in super early playtesting for v3.

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I hear you on making procedures public - getting the input of your players can be the best part. Allows you to make it better! I definitely think you should write about the "switch", and about how players are adjusting their strategy/tactics to the monsters' algorithm in your thread about that. I think that would be really interesting to hear as the game evolves!

Well, on one hand I agree with you. In an ideal world, there should be principles and guidelines and agreements. On the other hand, it's strange to criticize certain games for this when, as far as I know, pretty much no RPG does this (I've only heard of your house rules and, according to your comments, Dragon Union, perhaps?), so it's a pretty universal thing to face.<br/><br/>Having said that, while I can imagine it happening in AW, I feel like a game where that's an actual issue is one where the group isn't quite on board with the playstyle AW is built for. In my experience, some combination of "make their lives interesting", "look through crosshairs", the structure of threats and soft/hard moves, and, perhaps most importantly, "be a fan of the players' characters" handles this pretty well. On top of that, you get the way the rules are basically designed to guarantee a lot of agency to the players (I mean, even your character dying can be a good thing in AW), and it's pretty hard to run into trouble.<br/><br/>In combination with all that, of course, when I play AW I'm also always drawing on basic "story game principles" of protagonism and theme and moral conflict, which means that "who gets shot in gunfight" is generally a non-question: like Nathan suggests in this thread, what the fight is *about* in the first place is far more interesting and far more front-and-center.<br/><br/>I can imagine that if someone tries to play AW without an awareness of those elements, however, they could go awry. But then I'd imagine they would go awry even more easily in just about any other game.<br/><br/>In my experience, pretty much everyone runs the game way too "soft". When I run it I don't even use the armor rules as-written, because I find them entirely too forgiving (and same goes for some of the moves in 2nd Ed). The PCs are so strong in AW that you can push them pretty hard; it seems to me the game is best when that's what you do.                        </div>

Let me recap.</p><p>I was talking about how in my “world”-based (as in location-based rather than event-based, no relation to the old “* World” moniker for PbtA) games I’ve found this as an issue that we had to address. The notion that I’m some sorta neutral judge or referee and yet I have the power of life &amp; death in my hands? “Incoherent!” ← (Lemongrab voice) So we’re working to fix this. The lack of The One Ring style limits on what attack types and targets the pretties could choose really exacerbated the problem. “Hi you get mauled by 1000 wolves”, an encounter that might be easy if we were stuck with the artificial limits that miniatures would’ve imposed. I am committed to making TotM work.</p><p>I acknowledged that in a pure theme-addressing game this wouldn’t be an issue. DeReel asked how “hybrid” games that have both story <em>and</em> danger elements to them would handle it. Opposite RISS corners, Impronitfol and Skillfrotz.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/RISS official, canonical theory v 1.4.1" rel="nofollow">RISS official, canonical theory v 1.4.1</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Impronitfol and Skillfrotz are strange bedfellows but they snuck away at the prom, leaving their boyfriends by the punchbowl. Losing in style is winning. “Playing to lose” and “playing to win” come together in a game of portraying your character truly, completely and to the hilt, taking the consequences both mechanical and diegetic, but taking the challenge seriously. My friend said, and I’ll never forget this: “I do want to win. But I want to win <em>as Joanne</em>.”<br/>[…]<br/>The key to getting the corners to work together is to identify their conflicts and making a choice in favor of one of the two for that particular problem area. For example, when Skillfrotz, which is all about player’s choices in challenges, and Impronitfol, which is all about character’s choices in challenges, get together, a common conflict is when a player makes a choice for the sake of being true to their character, but the choice endangers the rest of the characters, whose players would rather make choices to try to succeed that particular mission. Adressing the issue with a choice in favor of one or the other corner, through rules (“You should do your best to succeed. This is a challenge based game.”) or conveyance (“When you stay true to your character and that puts the character in risk, you get an Inspiration token”) is key to making the corners work together.</p></div></blockquote><p>I brought up some examples of hybrid games that I think do it well because they have mechanisms in place to ensure that theme trumps danger (ditv, hf, cd) or danger is less consequential (fiasco, microscope, final girl) [less consequential on the social layer – it’s plenty consequential intradiegetically].</p><p>In AW, DW and BitD it’s less clear cut. But they do have algorithms in place that <em>attempt</em> to address this and that’s admirable; it’s to the extent that <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">@skinnyghost</a> (according to his post-game commentary) imported the move system into SWN for that episode. Where I’m trying to solve the problem via mashing up TOR and DU, he reached for AW. Making soft moves (announcing badness) before letting AW-style windows (such as flubs on the PC’s behalf) lead to more harmful moves such as direct attack rolls. From an audience perspective it came across as super incoherent. Just as my algorithm sometimes have struggled with weird bugs. My algo used to really break down vs the spell “Conjure animals” which it now addresses directly &amp; inelegantly.</p><p>So I’m walking a rhetorical tightrope here; on the one hand addressing my admiration for AW’s algorithm (compared to vanilla D&amp;D/SWN or compared to 90’s games) and on the other hand explaining why I want to make a more explicit &amp; gloracular algorithm for my own game.</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li>If theme says you’re gonna die, that’s cool</li><li>If GM/DM whim says you’re gonna die, that sucks</li><li>If gloracle says you’re gonna die, that’s glorious</li></ul><p>The move list and principles are part of AW’s gloracle. My game isn’t a copy of AW, I had some different design influences when cooking up my own gloracle structure.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I can imagine that if someone tries to play AW without an awareness of those elements, however, they could go awry.

Not saying AW or <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> aren’t great, they are.

<p>PS speaking of the importance of algorithms like these:</p><p>S-G’s own <a href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">@Ben_Robbins</a>  wrote <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/705/west-marches-secrets-answers-part-1/" rel="nofollow">Every Square Is 5 Feet</a> a few years ago that was one of the inspirations for me to improve this stuff. When I first read it I was nodding along self-congratulatorily “Hohoho I’m so clever I can run TotM fights just as ‘objectively’ as he could run his minis fights” but I kept it in the back of my mind and as the months passed by, I realized that I definitely had a lot of room for improvement in this area. But rather than going to minis, I was gonna raise the bar on TotM fights (and don’t bring up 13A – at the time I was self-congratulating, I was on about the same level as AW or 13A. I want <em>even better</em>). Which is still a WIP but we’ve come a long way since then thanks to TOR &amp; DU &amp; our own extensive changes to those systems. Gonna try to work in some zone / aspect stuff too before putting a bow on it, but, first, playtesting v3 of monster target prio list. Testing is slow going b/c even though we played four times last week there’s not always a lot of fighting going on in our sessions.</p> </div>

I kind of wish I'd had it on hand when we had a very lengthy discussion about this about 5-6 years ago:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18672/is-aw-suited-to-gamist-challenge-based-play</a><br/><br/>I didn't do a very good job of explaining my position (judging from most of the replies), but AW is also a bit of a "darling" (and was even more so at the time).<br/><br/>Still, it's more or less the same topic. <br/><br/>I think our disagreement here is basically about what AW is, fundamentally, as a game. I see it very much as a "theme-addressing game", even though it's encoded into the rules and procedures in a subtle and coy way. Trying to treat its procedures as a "gloracle", in my opinion, is not ideal (though they can work in limited situations).<br/><br/>Consider, for instance, what good it does to know "who the monsters attack?" when, first of all, they are no monsters ("name everyone, make everyone human"), and, second, there are no turns (so, even if you the rules get to tell you WHO the enemy attacks, you still have to decide <i>how many times</i>!)<br/><br/>So, in my opinion, focusing on theme is what actually makes the game work (and SING!), since the procedures by themselves do not produce the magic you like to describe as the gloracle (what a lovely term!). As Deliverator describes in that thread, there are all kinds of subtle ways that the moves push play towards that dynamic, as well.<br/><br/>I'll try to take a look at Swan Song, but if it's longer than 10 mins or so I won't have time. <br/><br/><img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> It might be simply out of my reach, logistically.<br/><br/>You referred to another video where Adam talks about adapting AW moves to the game... how might I search for that one?                        </div>

Which is it – am I proposing PbtA as the perfect challenge based game or am I saying it doesn’t work as a challenge based game?</p><p>Which is it – AW doesn’t need to address the consequences of dangerous actions, or it addresses them perfectly?</p><p>All I tried to say was that AW, BitD and DW had enough of trappings of adventure games to make this an issue that the games need to address, and, arguably, do attempt to address in a way unlike any game that preceded them except perhaps minis based games (c.f. Ben’s text) but I want to go a <strong>lot</strong> further (again, c.f. Ben’s text).</p><p>GURPS doesn’t have anything like “Make soft moves unless you’re in this or that situation, then you may make hard moves”. So AW is more “advanced” than GURPS in this regard <em>simply by having procedures for the MC to follow</em>. And AW in turn doesn’t have anything that can produce crisp/discrete results like “one of the skeletons will attack Drooma with a sword. Then the wight will attack Samu with a life drain ability. The three remaining skeletons will shoot at Samu with shotbows.” So 2097e is more advanced than AW in this regard. <small>It could be an “advancement” that in the end is ultimately completely misguided, a dead end, the 2019 equiv of ten thousand pages of tables a la Rolemaster Claw Law. People might switch over to apps for running fights or they’ll go back to fudging &amp; illusionism or they’ll stop playing challenged based games altogether. Or whatever. But I mean, 2097e is further along this particular vector – explicit rules for the DM – than what AW is.</small></p><p>Maybe that relationship—GURPS &lt; AW &lt; 2097e—is what’s tripping you up. As that thread rightly pointed out, AW has some issues when it comes to challenged based play. (Although that certainly seems to be selling points of games like Burning Empires or Blades in the Dark). But the question could just as easily be: <strong>“Are 90’s-style games suited to Gamist/challenge-based play?”</strong></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" rel="nofollow">Adam_Dray</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I can’t imagine how that works. The MC has no real limits on how hard he can hit the PCs. In Gamist mode, I’d think everyone would have to agree on some limits for creating challenges or the victories would be meaningless (and basically GM fiat).</p></div></blockquote><p>That’s much <strong>more</strong> true for games like VtM, Kult, Blue Planet, Tribe 8, SLA Industries, Everway or whatever. There can be puzzles and investigation, but that can happen in an AW game too (with prep [as in ‘pre-committed world facts’] – “do what the prep demands”).</p><p>It’s true to some extent for AW (sorry for dragging you into this, <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray%29">@Adam_Dray)</a> but AW has, as I mentioned, onstensible limits on when hard movies can be applied.

<div class="Message">
<p>A couple of reasons. One is that I’m feeling a bit like you ask questions, I answer them, then you re-ask the same question, I answer it again, then you re-ask it again. I get the feeling that you’re not really reading my answers. I want to explain/teach this stuff, I do, but I also feel straw-dolled and my position misrepresented. I respect and am influenced by <a href="/forums/profile/lumpley">@lumpley</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a> and owe a lot to them.</p>
<p>I feel like you want me to say “AW is great it solves this completely” and then you can go “nuh-uh, it’s not a good challenge-based game at all” <b><i>or</i></b> you want me to say “AW sux it can’t do anything right” and then I’m in the position of having to try to out-design these masters. I started work on 2097e in 2014 and this particular subsystem [ripped off from the alchemical synergy of TOR and DU] started in the summer of 2018. AW came out in 2010. Two years before the mirror story even happened. It’s unfair to AW to expect it to do what 2097e does. It has different design goals and it came out earlier.</p>
<p>Now, if we get down into more specific claims such as “Since AW is primarily about theme it doesn’t matter if it can’t address the issue” or “AW’s procedures and principles and GM moves adequately addresses the issue” or “AW’s non-Gamist CA makes it unable to address the issue” or “AW’s non-Gamist CA makes addressing the issue unnecessary”, I <i>could</i> make a second post why I disagree with those claims and why they contradict each other.</p>
<p><i>But</i> I’m not an expect in AW, and 2097e’s restrictions denies the DM access to AW’s tools. I can’t <strong>separate them</strong> [the player characters] because I can’t control their actions. I can’t <strong>capture someone</strong> because I can’t control the monster’s actions. I can’t <strong>put someone in a spot</strong> because I can’t push encounters whenever it pleases me, they need to come from the gloracle. I can’t <strong>trade harm for harm</strong> or <strong>inflict harm</strong>, the mechanics tell us when to inflict harm. I can’t <strong>take away their stuff</strong> because I can’t control the monster’s actions. <strong>Make them buy</strong> is great♥ Use it all the time. “Sure, you can clear away the rubble. That’s gonna take two hours. Do you?”. Not super relevant to this issue. I don’t have to <strong>activate their stuff’s downside</strong> directly; but I set up the rules to do that for me (“Sure, you can pop off a firebolt but you’re in the front rank so that’s at disad”) for me. <strong>Tell them the possible consequences and ask</strong>… uh… “You can take one step forward but if you do, you are going to get 22 damage from poison darts?” Not saying not be clear about what the room looks like or what time it is etc, but <em>finding out</em> consequences is a big part of exploration play and is what made the mirror story so appealing. **Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost." While I can and do point out costly opportunities when they do exist, I can’t <em>create</em> them whole cloth. Etc etc for the other moves.</p>
<p>In short, 2097e isn’t about me doing stuff (making moves). It’s about the player characters and the gloracle doing stuff.</p>
<p>That’s not meant as slight on AW. AW has other tools because it is built on different premises and axioms than 2097e is.</p>
<p>Reason number two is that I also got stressed out over being pushed into some sorta role digging through <a href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost%E2%80%99s">@skinnyghost’s</a> videos, scrutinizing them etc. I’m not here to criticize his games. I don’t want to start shit with him or his math squad. It made me really really regret even mentioning “YouTube” vaguely, let alone giving an example episode and calling out a specific spacemaster.</p>
<p>Reason number three: I also don’t appreciate being given homework (dig up this or that clip, write this-or-that in this-or-that thread) when you then have the attitude of “I personally don’t have time for it so you have to go do it for me”. That’s sort of a double standard. My time is valuable too. As far as I’m concerned I’d rather just drop the entire YouTube subthread of the conversation. When it comes to doing write ups in other threads, I already <em>am</em> committed to making a more formal write-up of the system but it’s not ready yet. I can answer questions though and I did link to the pencil sketch doc I’m working from.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the interaction overalll and I hope my annoyance isn’t overstated. On a scale of 1 (“annoyed”) to 10 (“very annoyed”) it’s at about a 2.7 or so.</p>
<p>I just really <em>don’t</em> want you starting shit between me and those other RPG creators. They probably don’t even know who I am since I’m just toiling away on my own personal heartbreaker while they are stars of stage and screen, but going through my posting history here and on TBP, what I always end up regretting the most is criticizing other DMs and other games. I want us to build each other up, not tear each other down.</p>
<p>Usually the DMs/creators I talk about the most are not the ones that bug me the most (what can I say to a cheater who teaches his followers to how stack the deck of many things and how to use sleight of hand to make bad rolls look like 20s) or the ones that already have a position pretty similar to mine (can’t say much more than “keep up the good work”). John, Vincent and Adam are more interesting for me to talk about, because they do come at this field genuinely and passionately but from a different angle than I do and they don’t have the same blind spots I do, and perhaps also vice versa.</p>

                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out how to respond, and I'm really not sure. It sounds like you and I are having totally different conversations: I have no idea where you're getting these "I feel like you want me to say" statements - they seem entirely irrelevant to what we've been talking about to me.<br/><br/>I don't know if that means I've been hopelessly unclear in what I'm saying, or that you're reading things into what I'm saying that aren't there, or something else altogether.<br/><br/>Does that mean we have to drop this conversation altogether? That would be sad, because I think it's quite interesting.

This I find interesting, although I don't know where you're getting these particular claims from. Do you disagree with them all? The first one (which is the closest to what I've been saying) seems to make the second, third, and fourth entirely irrelevant, from where I'm sitting, except maybe the last one.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see an example of what you had in mind, but your oblique mentions of various things online just didn't give me enough info to find any of them. I wasn't trying to "create homework" for you! You just didn't give me enough information to actually find them myself. For instance, I've Googled every variation of "swan song" + "post-game commentary" I could think of, and I can't get anything from that. Perhaps you are referring to a "GM Prep" video, which I know Adam does sometimes?<br/><br/>"Swan song" + "episode 17" doesn't get me very far, either. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>

                            First of all, not to gush, but I love <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> posts here because they often touch on things I'm interested in and have a different perspective from my own. I'm so glad to see you posting again lately.<br/><br/>To be honest I got pretty lost in the last couple of posts. I love reading y'alls threads here, they are the best I've found on the inter webs. I'm not sure I've had enough experience speaking on this subject to make myself clear in the way you folks do, but I was playing a game last night related to this topic and wanted to recount what it was like.<br/><br/>The game is called Dungeon Crawl Classics which is an old school D&amp;D clone that uses an interesting setup for character generation called the character funnel. In that game every player has around four randomly generated villagers which are 0-level with no classes. They have a mundane profession (baker, woodcutter, soldier) and some related equipment (an axe, a goat, some rope maybe). There is also some horribly lethal dungeon and an excuse for the villagers to go into that dungeon (probably some monsters have been kidnapping the villagers friends and family and taking them in there). The point, according to the game book, is that at the end of the adventure each player will probably only have one surviving character who is reasonably fit for adventuring. But honestly that's not why I play it at all, in fact I've never played past the character funnel.<br/><br/>I just love watching to see who lives and who dies, but I would never run a game like this organically without a rule set like this. It plays to the part of me who wants to be the audience as much as the director (or whatever metaphor you want to use). What comes out is part Oregon Trail and part Conan the Barbarian and that’s not a thing I would be likely to produce on my own.<br/><br/>I know that’s not directly related to the question posed in this thread, but I do think the question has sort of become “why would you ever want to leave who lives and who dies up to dice?”. The answer for me is sometimes I want to be a part of a story where the up and coming soldier dies from a stray arrow, while the sickly one-eyed baker finds a ring of great power and takes his first steps on the path to greatness. Now is that what the system is designed to produce? Not exactly because the soldier does have better odds than the baker (although I have found in practice those increased odds are pretty negligible). But somehow that makes the times it does happen all the more poignant for me. Sometimes the stuff that comes out is just goofy and I enjoy that too.<br/><br/>  More on topic would be to point out that one of the main character stats in the game is “luck”, which can be used to determine who is on the wrong end of the badness when there is no obvious in fiction guide to inform the decision. For instance, if no one has declared marching order who falls into the pit trap in the middle of the hallway? Just ask for everyone’s luck stats. Players can also burn off a certain amount of there character's luck stat to add to an important roll, but of course it will come back to bite that character later. What does that really say about the fiction being produced? “Everyone dies eventually” maybe? I have no idea if that’s good or bad. <br/><br/> Anyway I think I might have more to say about this but I’m going to cut myself off here. I think I’m just rephrasing some things that have already been said here but less succinctly <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

I love how they give oracular answers rather than relying on fiat.</p><p>Yesterday (yes… fifth D&amp;D session in twelve days…), something happened in our group. A character was being held under water and I asked if he had gasped for air before or not. I mean, in all honesty, he probably hadn’t, but who better to answer that specific question than the player, I thought. He said “I don’t know, let me roll for it. 50/50 high low, high I gasped. [rolls] Yes, I have air”. And then soon after, another character went under. He was more hesitant, and tbh I had seen his character be more cautious, but a pause to think about it, he decided to roll for it too and he ended up going under it with empty lungs. So both used kind of an inofficial “luck” roll voluntarily. They were just really committed to the sim I guess. I guess their reasoning was that the question of whether you gasp for air or not isn’t something you really choose, it’s just up to your reaction speed or w/e. Some sorta saving throw [unsure which category] also could’ve done it. IDK, I was impressed with them.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ebear" rel="nofollow">ebear</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>For instance, if no one has declared marching order who falls into the pit trap in the middle of the hallway?</p></div></blockquote><p>But here we have the downside of luck stats.</p><p>The way D&amp;D makes the game world come alive (the shared imagined space a.k.a. the “SIS”) is through traps!</p><p>Hallway pits make us ask for marching order.

                            Gosh I'm pretty embarrassed you are totally right about the covered pit trap example, mostly just because I've never used the luck stat in the way I described there. I agree it makes the pit trap totally pointless for the type of play we're talking about.<br/><br/>I think the example you used of gasping for air was much better, and more true to the way I've used it. I think the situation where this is useful is one where we are trying to establish a predicate after it has become obviously relevant. You can ask the player to establish the fact but it's already clear by choosing one answer they are hurting themselves and choosing the other feels a bit like cheating to the player and isn't satisfying. So rather than ask at all you use the luck stat in place of that decision because it's not a fun decision to make in the first place.<br/><br/>Just like any dice roll how often you use it is more or less a matter of taste. I would prefer to use it as little as possible because it's not all that satisfying to me for what we're doing. But ultimately running a game in the way we're talking about is hard and I'm very fallible so these situations do come up <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>

I really couldn't agree with you more here. I've been wanting to write a post about some cool innovations in the way OSR modules are written that I've noticed lately, I just haven't gotten up the courage yet. One example though is the way Veins of the Earth (which I think I've seen you reference) describes the way monsters sound and smell, I think that's just amazing.<br/><br/>I still think lots OSR modules really don't really go far enough with their visual and technical descriptions of the dungeon environment surprisingly. For instance it drives me bonkers when I see secret doors that are just labeled "S", leaving the hard work of deciding how exactly the door is concealed to the person running the game (I really consider this the heavy lifting of designing dungeons).<br/><br/>Anyway I'm way off topic. Thanks for your response, it sparked at lot of thoughts on my part!                        </div>

                            That's a great exchange between <a href="/forums/profile/ebear">@ebear</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> - I'm nodding along and smiling to your posts, both of you. All so true, and great insights! (And I'd love to see a post about innovations in written modules! Please do write that if you are so inclined, ebear. There are quite a few people here who are very much interested in that kind of thing.)<br/><br/>And excellent points about the Luck stat; I'd entirely forgotten that in my own "dungeon crawl" game I had included a "Lucky" stat precisely for settling questions for situations where the fictional content hadn't been well-established. My hope was always that taking an educated guess would be better, in general, than relying on a random die roll, so players would still want/need to interrogate the fiction and consider strategy.<br/><br/>It was my hope that wouldn't break down in the same way that "roll Luck when there's a trap there" might, since you're still hoping to avoid the roll in the first place.<br/><br/>I never got to play the game, though. (I got stuck trying to redesign it into a "players roll all the dice" system, and never made it out of that pit!)                        </div>

(Although, note to those struggling with Tomb of Annihilation in particular: page 126 has a general descriptions of secret doors that applies throughout the whole dungeon unless otherwise specified (and there are some exceptions such as room 51). It has a lot more detail than just the S of their previous modules but it’s still not really as much as I’d want.

Not sure what I think about it. Since Swedish RPGs are all runequest-derived, they’re used to the idea of rolling for attacks and rolling for defense. And I don’t like rolling so I’m glad I don’t have to do it.</p> </div>

                            " how being the one that carries the torch makes you faster (shouldn’t it make you more visible…?)" My experience, and I've read some other people experimented and came to the same conclusion, is that it's the way it works. The soldier with the light instinctively uses it to their advantage, and the others are left with trying to adapt to what is to them seemingly incoherent moves of light beam. And when you have the light, you blind everything in front of you, Only difference : seen from behind, you're a target like the others. Also, a torch held up high can negate this, but how long can one hold a torch up high is not very long (like, first minute in a room). Ask a boom operator. Still, a clever monster wins all if it takes the torchbearer down. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> target                        </div>

                            That makes some sense. For example, if you’re trying to move ahead of the torchbearer, your own shadow would often be exactly where you’re trying to go, more often than not.                        </div>

A little goofy idea:<br/><br/>I just wanted to say that I kind of like the idea that you can also create distinct monster types by messing with this algorithm. Maybe undead act in different ways than Orcs do, right? Orcs hate Dwarves, after all, and make that a priority in a fight unless they have a desperate need not to. And magically controlled creatures tend to do THIS, because the control is imperfect. And so on.<br/><br/>That's the kind of thing you write up beforehand, so it becomes part of your prep and part of the gloracle, but it's another thing the players can learn and figure out how to counter.                         </div>

                            Damage type vulnerability already do create a lot of variety in this regard; how Full Metal Frankensteins are immune to lightning and so on.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I want to put in, uh… "tribe-bashing" stuff like orcs vs dwarves. A lot of the exceptions and unusual situations in the fights come from the player side rather from the monster side and that's been awesome. Also… mastering the algo as it is, w/o making too many mistakes, is already difficult af. I'm def not ready to start switching it up<br/><br/>Sorry if this is like me shooting down all ideas and contributions. I'll put your suggestion in the back of my mind and maybe the idea will end up seeing some kinda use                        </div>

                            Yeah, I have no idea how easy it would be to adjust the algorithm, never having used it. If it’s not practical, that’s too bad, though - I think it would be really cool if, say, the minions mind-controlled by the Evil Archmage operated differently in combat, and the players could learn about that and develop strategy to counter them.<br/><br/>Sometimes we have to kill our darlings, though!

                            To me this is skirting close to "oh, but to hit these ideas, you need to roll UNDER their AC instead of over. Because they're goofy that way" sort of a Mel rule.<br/>IK you're working fiction-first which is the opposite of Mel but…<br/>it still amounts to almost changing the laws of physics.<br/><br/>BTW, the presence of minions already alter the dynamic quite a bit since they might enable the Evil Archmage to take a round or so in the back rank or even to be able to reach whoever the party was protecting in <i>their</i> back rank.                        </div>

but, like, if I am prepping monster emotion on that level I might sooner go with Nathan's level of detail. (These orcs hate whoever has a magical weapon. These orcs hate whoever is proficient with cook's utensils.) or w/e.<br/>I'd have to do it before even seeing the characters for it to be fair, which makes it kinda tough unless I prep every single hex beforehand.<br/> </div>

                            It's not physics... Your algorithm is based on the situations and your parties. That's why it's hard to change. <br/>If we adapt it to all parties and all situations, it loses efficacy. What about the monsters attack 1 the perceived greatest threat 2 whoever stands in their way to 1, and 3 what their training or officer screams them to do.

                            Not all situations : factors like how halflings are not considered a threat is a campaign setting choice. And reactions to defensive spells is clearly informed by your play. Some monsters wouldn't know the spells effects and couldn't act on this knowledge.<br/>I'll take the bets : a halfling with a crossbow and an ogre with a towel fighting against a pack of rats, and a skeleton archer.                         </div>

It’s been really fun, some sorta supernatural luck? They also already have the “lucky” ability in 5e.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And reactions to defensive spells is clearly informed by your play. Some monsters wouldn’t know the spells effects and couldn’t act on this knowledge.</p></div></blockquote><p>OK, yeah, this is good to address since in version 2 I explicitly called out conjured animals and armor of agathys. In version 3 (I guess I just haven’t figured out how to write it) this sort of stuff belongs in the Special layer (the “S” in “SACF”) which so far is way more vaguely defined. That’s also where Nathan’s lore specific stuff would go.</p><p>In version one, Conjure Animals and Armor of Agathys kinda broke the system in two different ways.</p><p><strong>Armor of Agathys</strong> I just let be for the longest time. I’m like “Hey, the system is the system, if they find an effective strategy, that’s what it’s there for”.</p><p>But it became stupid. The monsters became like the video game Lemmings. “Oh hi a guy covered in glowing frost that just zapped one of our friends? Let’s all go throw ourselves into that same death trap”.</p><p>But I just accepted it for the longest time as an artifact of how v 1 worked.</p><p><strong>Conjure Animals</strong> on the other hand was a much harder nut to crack. If the monsters have to attack the conjured animals, everyone the party is 100% safe. If the monsters can’t attack the conjured animals, they act as an unstoppable damage source that persists round after round. I went as far as to ask them to not use the spell, which was a horrible situation for everyone. That’s when I knew I had to fix it. Conjured Animals can’t contribute to front rank and the monsters (the DM) can choose freely whether or not to attack them. (Trying for the monsters to win the fight.)</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I’ll take the bets : a halfling with a crossbow and an ogre with a towel fighting against a pack of rats, and a skeleton archer.</p></div></blockquote><p>It was meant less as a bet and more of a fun thing to do for us which would help us grok the algo a bit better.</p><p>In this case, in the volley round the hin (or hobbit) can shoot at a target of her choice and the skellie would shoot at the ogre.</p><p>Then the mêlée starts. The hin with her ranged weapon would probably want to stand in the back rank, but seeing as she only has one friend – the ogre – that isn’t enough to guard her. Also, <em>swarm</em> keyword monsters, such as rats, can ignore front rank anyway [I need to type that into v2 and v3! That was an omission, it was in v1]. So we don’t have to worry about the medial predicates, only the lateral predicates; everyone is front rank in this situation.</p><p>Normally my skeletons are <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monsters_a-z/s/skeletons/skeleton" rel="nofollow">equipped with both a shortsword and a shortbow</a> but let’s say this skellie just has a longbow.</p><p>The swarm of rats is the bigger threat so they go for the ogre. The skeleton set her eyes (eye… sockets?) on the hin. Since the hin and the skeleton are in mêlée but using ranged weapons they are both fighting at a disadvantage trying to get shots in. Neither side is carrying light and there wasn’t a surprise round, so the “first strike” privilege goes to the home turf. Let’s say it was the rats and the skeletons little cigarette break room and the hin and the ogre just barged in there shouting “give us yer silver ya monter scum!!!”. So the rats get in the first bite v the ogre and the skeleton gets in the first shot vs the hin – at a kinda low change to hit b/c they’re up in each other’s FACES.</p><p>Then the ogre swats some rats w/ their towel and the hin casts a Hunter’s Mark spell before then dealing a bunch of damage to the skellie.</p><p>I as DM mark a little check box in the “A” column for the hin dealing so much damage and the rats try to scurry over to the hin. The ogre sees the opportunity and swats at them some more. The rats bite at the hin. Seeing as no-one is handling the ogre menace, the skeleton moves over to them. That would be a perfect opportunity for the hin to get in freeby but you can’t do opportunity attacks with ranged weapons, baby. The skeleton is so close to the ogre too, just as with the hin, that her shots are made at a disadvantage.</p><p>So now it’s rat v hin in one mêlée group and skellie vs ogre in another and that’s probably how it would remain unless the players themselves decide to mix it up. The ogre sick of bashing skellies wants to hit the rats and scurries over to the hin/rat messup. (That’s a move where encumbrance would matter – in my house rules it does for lateral, not medial, movement.) The skeleton, same deal – ranged-only can’t take advantage of opportunity attacks. So now there are these two mêlée groups. rat+hin+ogre in one, and skeleton in the other. Obv the skeleton would also scurry over and join the big fracas which is tough news for the hin who, having her “A” column checked from using Hunter’s Mark earlier, is the target of all the ire of both yellow rat teeth &amp; rattling bones unless the towel master ogre lures them away by moving away again.</p><p>Obv w/ monsters this week they’d die in one hit so most of this example is just in case everyone’s dice runs super cold.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Ha! Nice example. Sandra: in my “vision” you would do this before the campaign starts, most likely. “This is how most creature fight (default algorithm). This is how undead fight (slightly different algorithm - maybe they target holy symbols or they don’t react to magic or they never flee). And this is how mind-contrôlée targets fight.” That kind of high-level differentiation.</p></div></blockquote><p>Gotcha, yeah, that wouldn’t be cheating if it was all written down.</p><p>As you could see in my example w/ DeReel it was already very complex and complicated.</p><p>Kinda alot to juggle already. Mind control spells &amp; traps in 5e often specify the targets explicitly. As you saw, the rats being able to swarm could’ve affected the fight and the hin and so did the skeleton only having accessed to ranged spells.</p><p>Like, if there are one hobbit and two ogres, the ogres would normally be able to guard the hobbit, but if they’re up against two skeleton sword-dorks and a pack of rats, the skeletons keep the ogres busy while the rats can nom nom hobbitses. This is also when ranged come in – 1H2O vs three normal skeletons (w/ both swords &amp; bow) – two skeletons go fencing with the ogre and the last skeleton stands back and shot arrow in hin. All of that is <em>after</em> the hin has revealed herself to be a threat; if that hasn’t happened the monsters are happy to only hit the ogres and won’t try to jump through hoops to be able to get attacks in at the back rank.</p>

                            The spatial predicates, both medial (the ranks) and lateral (the mêlée groups) are… "texture" that enables the abilities already in the game to retain meaning in TotM space. And monsters and heroes already have plenty of weird abilities that make them fight differently when encountering that spatiality.                        </div>
