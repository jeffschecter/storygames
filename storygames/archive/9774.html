We didn't apply any of the "When your character comes back" rules on page 26 to this NPC. Is that right? Should we be increasing Particular Strengths for the NPCs to keep them in balance with the PCs? Or just because they are clearly more important to the fiction? <br/><br/>Is there a point where doing so or not doing so would become problematic? Five chapters? Ten chapters?<br/><br/>Should we even be working the NPCs into Oracle bits or should the GM bring any NPC into any chapter? What about bringing back a Big Bad later on; should we up their Particular Strength even if they haven't been in the intervening chapters? <br/><br/>When you're in Chapter 3 and beyond, can new NPCs be brought in with Particular Strengths of Significance 2 or does that just apply to PCs?<br/><br/>What's worked and not worked with IAWA NPCs at your table?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217040/#Comment_217040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T14:17:05+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  2:17PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 7, 2009 2:22PM by Ry.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stat 'em up like new, and if it's chapter 3 or later their PStns can be 2 if you (the GM) wants. <br/><br/>If you get really attached to an NPC I'd say something like "Hey guys, I really like Prince Natan, and he's been the underdog a few times.

Were we to play subsequent chapters, hell yes I woulda done that. I think that's the easiest way. <br/><br/>I don't really see a need to up the Particular Strength unless it seems appropriate to the chapter you're in, or if he's a bigbig bad, he should be more bigbig baddish. Mostly, I agree with what Ryan said on this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217306/#Comment_217306" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T16:11:30+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  4:11PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yea, I don't usually We Owe List.

In the rules, "The unwitting husband of a serpent-demoness" comes up and is grabbed by Mekha's player as describing Mekha in that chapter. If no player picks a particular suggested character role, the GM could do the same thing to an NPC in order to bring that NPC back.  "The unwitting husband of a serpent-demoness is your former mentor from Chapter One, Tullius!"  <br/>Another way for an NPC to recur is for someone to create a PC from an oracle entry with the same name and Particular Strength (if any) as a previous NPC; daring anyone to say it's not the same person.  No NPC can ever have a particular strength of greater significance than 2, because NPCs do not go through the advancement process.  At the beginning of the chapter, assign all NPCs their dice. Recurring, not recurring, it doesn't matter. They all get a fresh set, damage never carries over for them.<br/><br/>-- Vincent (&amp; others)<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217362/#Comment_217362" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T21:31:01+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  9:31PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks DainXB, I wasn't able to find that.
