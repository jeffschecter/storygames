I noticed that there was this column that said "available" (following "event limit").  It dawned on me what this was.  How many slots are open in this game.  Well shit.  As I look down the list I see all goose-eggs.  With some exceptions...<br/><br/>So there is a list of 55 games participating in the Indie Game Explosion.  Follows is a list of the only games not sold out:<br/>By The Stars - 8/16 8pm (5 of 12 taken)<br/>By the Stars - 8/18 2pm (6 of 12 taken)<br/>Artesia: Tales of the Throne Thief - 8/16 2pm (1 of 8 taken)<br/>Artesia: Tales of the Throne Thief - 8/18 8pm (2 of 8 taken)<br/>Grey Ranks - 8/18 12pm (3 of 4 taken)<br/>Artesia: Adventures in the Known World - 8/17 10am (0 of 6 taken)<br/>Artesia: Adventures in the Known World - 8/17 2pm (2 of 6 taken)<br/>With Great Power... - 8/18 10am (3 of 5 taken)<br/>Kayfabe: The Inside Wrestling Game - 8/18 10am (1 of 6 taken)<br/>Kayfabe: The Inside Wrestling Game - 8/18 2pm (5 of 6 taken)<br/>Kayfabe: The Inside Wrestling Game - 8/19 10am (0 of 6 taken)<br/>With Great Power... - 8/17 12pm (1 of 5 taken)<br/>Serial - 8/17 3pm (0 of 5 taken)<br/>Serial - 8/19 12pm (0 of 5 taken)<br/><br/>Only 14 of 55 games are available for Indie game Explosion (and I would remove two from the list because they only have one slot available).  That's pretty impressive to have all those games filled up.<br/><br/>But I wondered, why not the other 14?  Why did the 40 games fill up and leave only a handful empty?  I would like to hear why you avoided these, particularly the ones with no signups or just 1 or 2:<br/><br/>a) heard things about the game that didn't seem interesting<br/>b) description didn't sound interesting<br/>c) not on the list of games I must play at GenCon<br/>d) schedule conflicts with a game I really wanted to play<br/>e) I played it already<br/>f) other answer, please explain further<br/><br/>I think there is something telling here about our "market" and why people play certain games.  Please enlighten us (seriously).  Your critiques are welcome.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74271/#Comment_74271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T13:58:35+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  1:58PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you ask this elsewhere, too?

Kayfabe is little known, and older (though I recommend it heartily if you like pro wrestling even a little bit) than some other Indie Games. Artesia is a bit less "avant guard" than some of the other indie games (though it has some very interesting mechanics here and there). Also while Mark Smylie is clearly independent, frankly he hasn't really been part of the indie community in the past. Basically there's less buzz about his RPG than others that are closer to The Forge. For no particularly good reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be interesting to note that being talked about a lot by Forgies is more likely to get your game played in an indie event like this than winning the Origins Award. Not really unsurprising, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo us hardcore folks probably have filled up the better known Indie RPGs more quickly. Just a guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74516/#Comment_74516" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T12:37:06+00:00" title="June  8, 2007 12:37PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before we go boo-hooing about the lack of attention Artesia has gotten, it did win the 2005 Origins Award for Roleplaying Game of the Year.
