This is one of the little details I thought of.<br/><br/>We had this NPC - an amnesiac tinker gnome - whose entire job in the game (in hindsight) was to do things that the players weren't doing. It was entirely believable that this guy could pull any invention in the universe out of his bag and do something dumb with it that would eventually lead the PCs down the right path.<br/><br/>So what if the PCs were the ones in charge of him?<br/><br/>Imagine that your adventuring team includes all the PCs, plus the Patsy.  (Noun: A person taken advantage of, especially one considered relatively na\xc3\xafve.) That character is normally the team's plucky, zany comic relief, thus relieving (preventing?) the players from playing such a role continuously. The Patsy can be "picked up" and used at any time by any of the players, to do things that they think should happen in the interest of furthering the story, but which violate their character's beliefs, motivations, moral codes, etc. You can thus concentrate on properly playing your own character and still accomplish things that he or she wouldn't normally do.<br/><br/>Of course, what happens when your character kills or disowns the Patsy for doing something egregious is a good question. It's not a fully-baked idea yet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61926/#Comment_61926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T07:30:06+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  7:30AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Patsy must have some attribute that makes him indispensable.<br/><br/>He's someone's younger brother.<br/><br/>He's got a unique skill that's absolutely crucial.<br/><br/>He's got plot immunity.<br/><br/>Whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61938/#Comment_61938" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T09:05:31+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  9:05AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your own personal LHO?<br/><br/>Heh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61970/#Comment_61970" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T12:19:41+00:00" title="March 23, 2007 12:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, cool idea. Having some extra NPCs around could also help with those situations when PCs are separated. The PCs might be separated, but the players can still all engage in the game by picking up some lesser characters, like grogs in Ars Magica. <br/><br/>I find the idea particularly interesting because I have a patsy in my Jedi in the Vineyard campaign, a captured Sith that the Jedi PCs are treating like a younger brother--that is, alternately tormenting and guiding. He's also a good sounding board for the moral issues that come up in play. ("Wow, you're going to expose the evils of the corporation that most of the city's livelihood depends on. The good citizens of Carron will thank you <i>so</i> much for taking away their jobs.") <br/><br/>Giving him over to the players is certainly an idea worth considering. They might find it liberating to take the part of a bitter cynic rather than always toeing the party line. Also, one of the PCs--a former Sith himself--is trying to guide the patsy to the way of the Jedi and might even take him on as an apprentice if the guy comes around some more. He'll acquire a kind of plot protection if that happens. <br/><br/>But is protection of the patsy even necessary? I mean, if he dies, he dies. It's only an NPC, after all. If the PCs miss the benefits of having the patsy around that's their loss. They should have protected him better, is all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61972/#Comment_61972" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T12:42:02+00:00" title="March 23, 2007 12:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And you can always throw them another one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61979/#Comment_61979" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T13:19:02+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  1:19PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought this thread was going to be about PCs framing NPCs for their crimes, which I am always trying to do and which nobody else in my group cares about ever, I was all set to complain and such, then I find this???<br/><br/>Pretty good idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
