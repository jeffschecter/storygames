There's something about the rules and the setting implied in the rules that has always turned me on.  However, the rules as they stand have never actually seemed to produce the things that I thought they should.  It's like the rules teased me with the kind of game I wanted to play, but did not deliver.<br/><br/>For clarity, here's a post I made on RPG.net from a while back that really lays out a lot of the color and themes that I saw in the game. The thread was about whether or not there are "heroes" in <i>Traveller</i>.  IMO, it was a  bizarre, semantic non-issue. But it got me to clarify what I saw a the PC roles in the setting:\n<blockquote><br/>I think the posts on this board nail really one of the unique features of this game: that in a sprawling universe of potential adventure, your character still had to get the bills paid; in a universe so big your character could never reach its end, your PCs bones were already getting creaky as he started his life of free-lance adventure; in a stellar empire of infinite possibilities the choices your character had made in his youth limited who he was in his 40's.<br/><br/>This, I think, is an amazing and unique tension for RPGs. It's a completely different set of concerns than found in most RPGs -- which cater to the delightful and high spirited point of view that "All I need to do is keep going and I'll get more powerful and powerful." Traveller was written from the point of a view of adulthood, and most RPGs (and this is neither good nor bad) work from the adolecent view that lacks an awareness of mortality death, decay or limits.<br/><br/>Does this mean there are no heroes in Traveller, by the way? No. The tales of Beowulf, The Lord of the Rings, Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur and other fantastic legends posit the tension between fantastic settings and heroic deads against the encroaching weakening of muscles, the end of ages and life. Star Wars, on the other hand, the model for a lot of RPG sensibility from the mid-seventies onward, possesses exactly that naive-kid-in-a-big-place-stretching-his-muscles-forever sensibility. It's significant, I think, that <i>Traveller</i> was on the way to the printer just as Star Wars hit the screen. It's a pre-Star Wars SF setting. This makes it not better or worse than all the would be "youth" tales -- just different.<br/><br/>So, first think <i>Traveller</i>.  Now think, "Clint Eastwood." See? Easy as pie.</blockquote>\nAs I mentioned on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3138" rel="nofollow">another Traveller thread</a> on Story Games I think "The Man Who Would be King" is a perfect Traveller movie.  Replace the mountains that Michael Caine and Sean Connery travel into with a backwater world at the edge of the Imperium, and you have a couple of guys drummed out of the served with big dreams.  Other movies that match the feel I'm going for are "Outland," "Seven Samurai," and maybe "Unforgiven," "The Searchers," and "3:10 to Yuma."  <br/><br/>The idea of The Frontier is very important to me on this... again, the idea of expanding outward; the tension between civilization and imposing law on lawless lands; the tension between living in a romanticized landscape while needing to eek out a living; and so on...<br/><br/>While I'm still toying around with trying to figure out building the "perfect" Traveller system to get what I want, I doubt I'll ever really get around to it.  And <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> core system does a lot of things really well in terms of strong, clear, PC driven, narrative mechanics.<br/><br/>One of the things Clinton mentioned was that switching out the Pools does a lot to help evoke setting and color.<br/><br/>Here are the Pools as written from the game:\n<blockquote><b>Vigor</b> represents the character's reserves of physical power, wherewithal, and mental toughness. Characters with high Vigor are often known for bulging muscles, scarred faces, calloused hands, the "thousand-yard stare," and crushing strength.<br/><br/><b>Instinct</b> represents the character's reserves of animal-like reactions, both physical and social. This ranges from cat-like reflexes in combat to pheromone-like sexual attraction. Characters with high Instinct are often known for their graceful motion, penetrating eyes, amazing hearing, stunning appearance, or sexual prowess.<br/><br/><b>Reason</b> represents the character's intelligence and mental power. This could range from book knowledge to an uneducated, but highly practical mind. Characters with high Reason are often known for their vocabulary, ability to identify plants and animals, skill at games of chance, or power over others.</blockquote>\nSo, I'm thinking I'd replace "Reason" with "<i>Experience</i>."  This is accumulated know-how and wisdom that comes from being around the block a few times.<br/><br/>I think I'd also replace "Instinct" or "Vigor" with "<i>Ambition</i>."  The <i>Traveller</i> system had a Social caste built into the character creation process, and I think it's part and parcel of the Age of Empires feel that the game and setting draw on: Sir Richard Burton running around India, Afghanistan and Africa trying to finally prove himself.  This would be the Pool of innate drive that helps a character move forward -- whether reflected in stamina, the ability to seduce, sell, con, endure or otherwise keep going.  (Maybe it would actually be "<i>Social Ambition</i>" -- codified by a desire for Wealth, Social Standing, marrying well and so on...)<br/><br/>I've only begun toying with this.  Does anyone have any other suggestions for switching out pools for the kind of game and color I'm after?<br/><br/>Also, any thoughts on Secrets, Abilities and Keys?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>CK                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97886/#Comment_97886" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T12:36:51+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 12:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Secret of Membership</b><br/>You are a member of the Traveller's Aid Society.

I think it's got an incredibly coherant Simulationist design, and I'd be wary of changing it.  Your TSoY hack will be quite a different game.  To get all Big Model on you, Classic Traveller is about reinforcing the genre, it's about <i>being</i> a gritty space-mercenary who's been round the block a few times.  Traveller says "Old Ex Soldiers are great at gaining wealth in a big galaxy".  Narrativist Traveller would be about <i>problematising</i> being such a character.  It would be about the tension between ambition and weariness, experience and obsolesence.<br/><br/>Which is a cool game, but very different from Traveller.  Some Key ideas:<br/><br/>Key of Old Faithful:<br/>When you take this Key, select an item of technology that your character uses, which has some important history attached to it, and which is now somewhat antiquated.  For example, this could be an old sidearm from the war, a dented up old spaceship, or a bow and arrow from your tribal homeworld.<br/>1 XP for every scene in which you use the item.<br/>3 XP for every time you use that item when there's a clearly superior alternative.<br/>Buyoff: Trade in the item for a newer model.<br/><br/>Key of Bitterness (This Key needs some work)<br/>Your character has an old predjudice from some long-ended war.  Choose a group of people (for example a species of alien, or a nation or ethnicity).  The group should not be universally despised.<br/>1 XP every time voicing your predjudice gets you in trouble.<br/>3 XP for refusing to help a member of the group.<br/>Buyoff: Help a member of the group without the expectation of reward.<br/><br/>Key of Old Wounds<br/>Your character has an old wound, physical or psycological, which impairs their actions.  This could be a leg full of shrapnel, a missing arm, or jitters from shellshock.<br/>1XP Every scene in which you're inhibited by your wound.<br/>3 XP Every time you lose a significant opportunity because of your wound.<br/>Buyoff: Have the wound permanently treated.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that FATE would also be a cool way to do this, and might handle the Simmy goodness of Traveller better.  "War Buddies" would be a cool Aspect that could be tagged to have a buddy help you out, or compelled to meet a friend in need.  "Old Wound" could be tagged for looking menacing, or for convincing people of your experience, and compelled to hinder all kinds of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98031/#Comment_98031" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T21:35:23+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  9:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This stuff is great...!

Because, like I said, the game as written never delivered what I was trying to unpack from it.  This might be a failing on my part -- I'll never know.  But I want all that interpersonal and personal stuff.  To me it's how the world works.  (To assume otherwise is to assume the world is populated by die-hard economists -- which isn't the case!)  So, yeah.<br/><br/>Sometimes I'm tempted to hack the <i>Traveller</i> system itself, adding Keys or <i>Riddle of Steel-</i>style Spiritual Attributes to the Classic Traveller rules.  But then I'm not sure if they'll work well.  So starting fresh seems to the best course.  But I'm still thinking that through.<br/><br/><br/>Blake,<br/><br/>I think I'm with you on the Pools.  <b>Soldiering.  Ambition.  Experience.</b>  Boom.  That's the game right there!  That's the game I want.<br/><br/>Oh, and the default (reactive) Abilities I'm considering are Adrenaline, Need, Instinct.<br/><br/><br/>So, I'm also thinking of listing skills by Service.  Rather than having "Warrior" or "Illicit" groupings, each branch of the services would have a page with specific skills.  So, just like the CT character generation tables, there'd be overlap of skills, but you'd be able to see your Service's skills at a glance.<br/><br/>Also, I'm thinking you can get one or more Abilities for each "term" (four years of service added). Thoughts on this?<br/><br/>Also, I was going to go all bat-shit crazy coming up with Vagr Skills and Secrets and such, but then I realized I'm going to stick with Classic Traveller for now.  Humans, and just humans.  That which isn't Human is The Other and exotic.  Vagr will exist, with their own secrets, but they'll be for the GM.  The PC can pick up new secrets from aliens as they Travel.  (Maybe, though, they can have picked up Secrets while in the services, while interacting with alien races...)<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98206/#Comment_98206" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T13:37:39+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  1:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher,<br/><br/>Cool!  I like this a lot.  The pool names do a great job evoking the desired atmosphere.  And listing skills by service would totally bring back that old Traveller vibe--plus you could hook in Keys and Secrets the same way.  That way, for instance, the Marines and the Army might both offer the Key of Hooah! or the Key of Rank, whereas the Scouts and the Navy could offer (among others) the Key of Love My Ship, Secret of Orbital Maneuvers, etc.<br/><br/>This stuff really gets my blood up.

I can really see the potential of everything I loved about Classic <i>Traveller</i> growing out and into play... And yet...<br/><br/>I'm beginning to have doubts.  (As is expected.  I'm tackling something I've been wanting to tackle for years. I'm going to get it right.)<br/><br/>TSOY's reward system is based on getting the XP which not only gets you Keys and Secrets, but new Abilities and the IMPROVEMENT of Abilities.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure I want that.  I really am intrigued with the idea of CT that once a PC has mustered out, that's it.  This is your skill set -- but you want more.  What are you going to do about that.  While the TSOY skill point system is excellent, it might not be what I'm looking for.  (For creating characters, I think the first term of service gives you the starting points per the basic TSOY rules, and then you get another 4 points to spend on your character for every term served.  Once you muster out, that's it.)<br/><br/>What I think I want is the CT system some sort of character focused, story-based system attached.  Something like <i>Keys</i> or or Spiritual Attributes from <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>.  Skills remain static, but in context of PC driven situations, the PC gets an increase with bonuses.<br/><br/>Now, there may be a way to hack TSOY so we get static Abilities, but somehow XP can be spent to improve odds.  But I don't know the mechanics or the math of making that work yet.<br/><br/>Or I start from scratch using the material generated in the this thread and the other thread I linked to in the first post.<br/><br/>But I know about I'm about 40% there.  That is, I know what I'm trying to get to<br/><br/>Having gotten excited about the TSOY work so far, I'd hate to lose it.<br/><br/>So, does anyone have any idea on tweaking TSOY in this regard.  I'd really rather set it up like Spiritual Attributes, where the PC gets a regular die pool bonus to his Abilities as long as he's focusing on his Keys.  Maybe I switch out the XP points and say you get Bonus Dice for a scene equal to the standard Key XP rewards, depending on circumstance?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98231/#Comment_98231" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T16:37:54+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  4:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2007 4:39PM by Judson_Lester.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been following this with a keen interest, since I've always had something of a long-distance thing with <i>Traveler.</i>  I like the setting a lot, and the character creation and all that, but never got a chance to actually play it.  So I've been hesitant to weigh in on Pools and Abilities.<br/><br/>Regarding Keys, XP, and Advances, though, I've got a little mechanical background, since trying to run Solar System at Cons makes a lot of advances immaterial.  <br/><br/>I'd recommend the following, with any number of variations: \n<ol>\n<li>Up the Advance ratio to around 10 or so, so that XP feel scarcer.<br/></li><li>Either remove Abilities from the Advances menu, or (say) triple all the costs.  Possibly the same for Secrets.<br/></li><li>Drop the Gift of Dice<br/></li><li>Add to the Advances menu: "1 Advance: a bonus die to any roll."<br/></li></ol>\nThe biggest variation I can see would be to replace (or amend) that last with "1 Advance: 2 Gift Dice."  <br/><br/>I'm less sure about this one.  I like the idea of buying the right to demonstrate my approval, but at the same time, weighed against a new Key, I might never spend advances that way.  But weighing it against my selfish bonus dice, I might have a hard time saying no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98242/#Comment_98242" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T18:20:37+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  6:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher,<br/><br/>I know you're kinda hot on TSoY and God knows I loves me some TSoY but have you considered using FATE (either a SotC hack or 2.0) for this?

I'm not feeling the love.  This is no reflection on SotC.  I haven't used them, so I don't know.  They just seem kind of... gimmicky.

The thing about SotC examples is that they are (deliberately) pulpy in flavor.  One of my players selected "Avoid my father's fate" as an Aspect, for instance.  Lots of potential there, and definitely not  played for laughs.  In a Traveller game, you could do a lot with FATE.<br/><br/>That said, and much as I love FATE, I still think you're onto something exciting with TSoY, and suspect bonus dice rather than skill increases would be the way to go.  That way the Keys become generators of bonus dice rather than "experience."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98254/#Comment_98254" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T21:35:30+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  9:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2007 9:06AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, <br/><br/>Well, Judson, it looks like you and I were pretty much on the same page.  I hadn't thought of changing the XP:Advance ratio, and that helped a lot.<br/><br/>(I will, however, keep the Gift Dice.... I just think they are too valuable to the group dynamic for play.)<br/><br/>Here's what I've got:<br/><br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b><br/><br/>All characters start with three Innate Abilities: <i>Adrenaline</i>, <i>Need</i> and <i>Instinct</i>. Set one at a value of 0, one at value of 1, and one at a value of 2. <br/><br/>Characters start at the age of 18 and work are created in 4 year terms of service.  The first time automatically grants three Abilities at Rookie and one Ability at Skilled, as drawn from the appropriate list for the service.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abilities Selection Table</span><br/>Recruit*..............1 advance<br/>Skilled*..............2 advances<br/>Expert*...............3 advances<br/>Veteran*..............4 advances<br/><br/>After that, Players are given 4 advances per term of services <i>[EDIT: this might be too much -- maybe 2 Advances per term? See note in a post below]</i> to spend as they see fit, with the following rules:<br/><br/><i>* The Ability costs are cumulative - it costs 3 Advances to go from Rookie to Skilled, for example.<br/>* A Character can't be advanced in the same Ability twice in a row; another Ability must be Advance first.</i><br/><br/>If any Ability reaches Veteran or Expert level, something happened during that term of Service that's worth a story.  the Player has to tell the story.<br/><br/>Each character also gets one Secret and one Key during one of their terms of service.  The specific incident of getting the Secret and Key must be described.<br/><br/>[I haven't decided yet how much of CT to keep -- can you choose what service you want? Roll to get it in? Get drafted if you fail?  Do you get to stay in as long as you want?  Can you get kicked out if you fail your reenlistment roll even if you wanted to stay in?  I think I'm going to track down the Mega-Traveller rules on this stuff.  I know they added some variables.  I think this is part of the run color of the game and I'd like to keep it.]<br/><br/><br/><b>XP</b><br/>These are gathered, as per the rules of TSOY.<br/>XP convert at a rate of 10XP per Advance.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spending XP Table</span><br/>Increase a Pool by one point.......1 advance<br/>Add a Secret.........................1 advance<br/>Add a Key............................1 advance<br/>Reserve Dice*........................1 advance<br/><br/>* <i>Upon purchase, a Reserve Die must be assigned to one of the three Pools (Soldiering, Ambition, Experience.)  Reserve Dice can be spent in addition to all other dice.  They require no Pool activation point.  A player may gather as many as he wishes.  Any number of them can be spent in a single roll.  When rolled, they are removed from the PC's Reserve Dice pool.</i><br/><br/>How's that sounding?  <br/><br/>I'm a little concerned that without Abilities to spend blow XP on, players will drive their Pool Points past 10 and have a tone of Reserve Dice.  I'm not sure how the XP economy flows.  I <i>do</i> know that this layout feels really close.  The only other idea I'm noodling is doing some sort of cumulative penalty, along the lines of the original TSOY Ability Advance rules, so that getting your 8th Pool point is a multiple of 8, or you're 4th Reserve die is 4 times the cost, or your second secret is 2 time the cost.  But that might be <i>too</i> expensive.  I could drop the XP ration back down to 5:1 Advance.  <br/><br/>I do know that I don't want a lot of special case multipliers for the XP Advances.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98255/#Comment_98255" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-21T21:40:05+00:00" title="September 21, 2007  9:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding SotC and Traveller, I will pimp again <a href="http://www.phreeow.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Spirit+of+the+Far+Future" rel="nofollow">our ongoing project</a>.

Getting Credits to keep a ship running is a very different experience than collecting XP's that your character can funnel back into keeping the ship going.  In the latter case, as long as your PC is driving at his Keys, the ship is going to be fine.  In the former, if the PC is driving at his Keys but forgets to get enough Credits to pay the bills, there will be trouble.<br/><br/>Since the point of this exercise is for me to build the feel and quality of the game I loved but didn't get to play, I think book keeping is going to be a part of the game.  Now, whether that means actually tabulating down to the Credit, per the CT rules, or using an abstracted system, I don't know yet.  But I am sort of drawn to keeping the Credits going.<br/><br/>This occurred to me because, strangely, I was thinking of the time for Jumps.  Tracking time in <i>Traveller</i> matters -- because the PCs get older and every year after a certain age the stats have a chance of reducing.  Certainly I'd like to keep that.  (In this case, Players will make rolls with their Innate Abilities to prevent their Pools form decreasing.)<br/><br/>Again, this is like <i>Pendragon</i>.<br/><br/>Thoughts of tracking time led to thoughts of tracking money... which led to thoughts of, "Dear God, do I really want to deal with all that...."  So I'm not sure yet how to handle this.<br/><br/>The simplest way would be, of course, "Okay, you guys.  You need some Credits to keep the ship going. What are you going to do about it?"<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and I think that four Advances per term of service might be a bit much.  PCs will often muster out with 12 to 20 Advances -- which seems like they'll all be pretty uber and reduce the value of the other Dice bonuses in actual play.  I'm thinking of cutting it down to two per term.<br/><br/>Thoughts on either of these?<br/><br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98288/#Comment_98288" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T08:35:44+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  8:35AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was just reading up on the hack Brad's group made for the SotC game.

So I'm coming in over-invested already. Here goes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Ambition is wrong. A standard trope of Traveller is, as you've alluded to yourself, Christopher, the guy who's just trying to pay the bills. In fact most of my Traveller characters really always seem to be about accumulating enough money to retire to a life cruising the stars. And in the meanwhile living the relatively dilettante lifestyle of the Traveller... the people who live between the starts much of their lives. It's about traipsing from planet to planet and doing what you have to do to earn enough money to keep that lifestyle going so you don't ever stop being a Traveller. <br/>\n<br/>\nDefeat for a Traveller means that he ends up having to take up a day job on some planet for the rest of his life, never getting to see space again. How many of the scenarios start out like, "You're stranded in System X, without enough funds to get offworld, when this guy comes along with an offer..." The player could respond that his character just gets a day job, and quits being a Traveller, but that's just not what the game is about. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Ambition seems way too character specific. Heck, even "soldiering" is a little too specific to first edition sans supplments (there are supplements that let you play other occupations), but I won't quibble. I like the ex-soldier theme. But Ambition would just not fit many of the character concepts that I'd come up with. I'd replace it with the one trait that defines all Travellers, "Wanderlust." When something threatens to tie the Traveller down, what motivates him to do what needs to be done? His Wanderlust. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat refuels wanderlust? Dead simple, that one, moving on. Stay in one place too long, and, like a shark, you die. Got to keep moving. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe "tension" you mention is, to me, about that aging (or defying it with anagathics), and the will to keep moving even when moving becomes harder and harder due to age. Age is what makes the Traveller think about that nice beach planet he landed on, and just getting a hut there, and fading into obscurity. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for "Experience" or "Know How", you're so dead on. In fact, this replaces that wonderfull skill from Traveller, Jack-of-all-Trades. Absolutely essential. Some Travellers manage to maintain themselves in the lifestyle just by being rich or such, but for most it's a matter of knowing things that most dirtsiders don't know how to do... and being able to adapt those abilities to an infinite set of potential circumstances. An ability to Improvise. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'd run it Soldiering, Wanderlust, Know How. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the problem with advances... I'm tempted to point out that Classic Traveller did, in fact, have an advancement system (very sim, pay for training courses of X hours, get ability). But you're right in that this is very much not what Traveller is "about" in play. Not too long ago I was working on another system for Traveller, and what I think is interesting about Traveller is the contacts that Travellers make. People who one can leverage to gain advantage. What if you can spend EXP on contacts ala BE's Circles, or something like that? Make them far more efficient than buying your own abilities up (in fact it's easy to de-emphasize character abilities situationally in the Traveller universe). So then play becomes not about powering up personally but about networking your way up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, BTW, gets your "Age of Empires" feel, as it's about who you know in the next port of call who can help you out, ambition or otherwise. Also see Rudyard Kippling vis a vis "The Great Game" which is definitely germane. The Man Who Would be King is only one scenario in this panoply, and most of the stories are about playing your role in the Game (only occasionally going rogue like Colonel Kurtz). This fits in with lots of Traveller scenarios where the characters are called upon by the Imperium to do their duty as former soldiers to help out against foreign threats or insurgencies (I believe I learned the word Insurgency from playing Traveller). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I have as thoughts right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff" title="joshua neff"><img alt="joshua neff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.goblin-cartoons.com/images/lantern.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff">joshua neff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98657/#Comment_98657" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:00:42+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I was thinking along similar lines.

I think that I was worried that it'd somehow end up too crunchy. Or maybe I'd have to admit, then, that Mark beat me to the idea once again. <br/>\n<br/>\nCurse you Woodhouse!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut using BE's rules for equipment there would work, too, I have to admit. So you can spend on either, sure. In fact this does handle rather well the problem with equipment that one tends to run across in Traveller (after a while the gang owns multiple examples of ever bit of tech ever written up for the game... just in case). It would be better for people to be creating tech as needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this should be obvious to me, as Luke has admitted, I believe that BE is his fix of Traveller. <br/>\n<br/>\nA big question for me, is whether or not to include starships, and if so, how. That is, Starships are a huge deal in Traveller. Note that the system goes out of it's way to give opportunities for players to start in command of a starship (either as a merchant paying off the mortgage on it like a Home/Small Business, or as a Scout given a ship as a loaner). But it also makes it hard, and usually only the experienced will have a shot at having them (they get more rolls to get one). If you don't start with a starship then getting one seems catastrophically difficult. Usually you have to resort to being crew on a ship, or, again, being stuck dirtside a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nForgive me if I slip regularly into Neo-Traveller-ologisms. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when does one get a ship? Do you just start the group off with one as a central conceit of play? Is there a secret that can be taken? If so, who wouldn't take that secret (though I suppose there are those who might like playing out obtaining a starship, or other sorts of games... maybe they have money enough to pay for passages everywhere)? Or do you force players to obtain one through play? If they can do so, just how much does that cost in mechanical terms? What about different classes of ships... certainly a Fat Trader is going to be priced differently than some massive surpluss Tukera liner. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm tempted to go through the process of listing starting central conciets. This is particularly important in Traveller. But it might not be absolutely neccessary for TSOY/Traveller discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is neccessary, however, is the discussion of the Species and Cultures! Time to Grog up your nards here, and show us what you know! Pick a species from the many aliens out there, and write them up! I'll give it a start:<br/>\n<br/>\n***Humaniti***<br/>\n<br/>\nOld spelling Humanity. There are several races of humans spread throughout the Imperium and beyond. Some may have more Solomani traits, some more Villani, some more Zhodani, etc. Most Imperials tend to be a mix to some extent of Solomani and Villani, but one secrets below can be taken to represent a more pureblooded member with some specific racial trait. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Human Secrets**<br/>\n - Secret of Long Life<br/>\nPure-blooded Villani tend to age far less slowly than most humans. All aging tests are one die easier for a character with this secret. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of Psionics<br/>\nThe character has natural talent with psionics. This is especially prevalent (or at least discerned) amongst Zhodani, but can occur in any human. Note that this is not the same as being trained in Psionics, which is another secret. (IIRC, psionics is unique to humans in Traveller)<br/>\n<br/>\n**Human Keys**<br/>\n - Key of Versatility <br/>\nHumans are supposedly the most versatile of the major races, though this may be just a racial prejudice. Gain 1 XP when the character is the only one who can do something. Gain 2 XP when demonstrating versatility by spending 2 or more Know How Pool in a scene where this is described as using obscure skills to accomplish a task. Gain 5 XP when trying something risky and low skill in order to demonstrate versatility. Buyoff: Decide to be a specialist in something, and forget the versatility nonsense. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Key of Hoarding<br/>\nAs descendants of hunter/gatherer stock on Terra, humans tend to be quite aquisitive. Gain 1 XP when shopping for new stuff. Gain 2 XP when going out of the way to get some new trinket. Gain 5 XP for risking one's life for material gain. Buyoff: take a vow of poverty or otherwise learn the error of your hoarding ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to come!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98719/#Comment_98719" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T13:46:02+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  1:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blake,<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can say is that I'm not seeing anything in Traveller that's neccessarily about ambition at all. Yeah, I've seen ambitious characters, sure. But then I've seen lots of them that, actually, are lazy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one reason that I always said that Firefly was like Traveller. Mal is not ambitious. Oh, he may have been at one point. But now his stress is all about whether or not to get involved in things, or just concentrate on what he really loves, which is keeping himself free via his ship. Most Traveller characters I can recall in the games I played were either like Mal, or they had even less ambition than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was only ever one reason why anyone did anything in Traveller... money. Now that was in the wayback, and I can imagine more themes now. But there's nothing about the original game that says anything more ambitious than "Do the least amount of work and face the least amount of danger to get the most money." And while I think that this current incarnation can do more than that, I don't see how forcing ambition on every character is the right solution. Certainly wouldn't be for me. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Enterprise"... well that certainly does fit more with the original Traveller play. But, then again, that's what I'm hoping to get away from. Again, I want the open-endedness of the Traveller set of themes, all while keeping the very central part of moving around and seeing the universe. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor goodness sake, man! The game is named Traveller! That's got to be central!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98731/#Comment_98731" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:11:25+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 2:12PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ***Vargr***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a species of genetically uplifted dogs (though don't bring up that fact around them!) They tend to be more clannish than humans, because of their pack ancenstry, and have never managed to create large interstellar governments for long. Many are found in the borders of the imperium as citizens. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Vargr Secrets**<br/>\n - Secret of Canine Speed<br/>\nVargr are both faster than humans, on average, and have better reaction times. Gain a bonus die when in a contest involving these things with non-vargr. <br/>\n - Secret of the Senses<br/>\nGain a bonus die to any attempt to discover something through use of either sight or smell. <br/>\n - Secret of Body Weaponry <br/>\nSee Goblin secret of the same name (except this can be taken only once). <br/>\n - Secret of Charisma<br/>\nSome Vargr are just more able to lead than others for reasons that Vargr cannot explain to other species. All Vargr with this secret will generally be deferred to by Vargr who do not have the secret. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Vargr Keys**<br/>\n<br/>\n - Key of Dominance<br/>\nVargr are always adjusting their pecking order, trying to move up or down the chain of command. Gain 1XP any time you attempt to show yourself as more important than somebody else. Gain 2XP when you get somebody to defer to you. Gain 5XP if you get somebody to do something dangerous at your command. Buyoff: Submit to another (especially non-Vargr) by taking a subservient role or job. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Key of the Pack Member<br/>\nSimultaneously Vargr are always following orders of those that are in the pecking order above them. Yes, one can have both Key of Dominance, and Key of the Pack Member. Gain 1XP when you follow an order from somebody appropriately above you. Gain 2XP when you go out of your way to do something for a superior. Gain 5 XP for doing something dangerous to please a superior. Buyoff: Refuse to do what some Vargr with higher charisma tells you to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Key of Racial Pride<br/>\nMany Vargr, understanding that they are genetically engineered, tend to have inferiority complexes, while others compensate with overdeveloped senses of racial pride. Gain 1 XP when your character compares Vargr to other non-vargr species. Gain 2 XP when the character actively competes with somebody to show Vargr superiority. Gain 5 XP when risking something important to show off just how cool the vargr are. Buyoff: Admit to the inferiority complex driving this behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98734/#Comment_98734" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:17:41+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 2:18PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike,<br/><br/>I'll be giving your posts a lot of thought, but I think there's a general framework that should be addressed:<br/><br/>My goal in this is to dig out the pieces that I think worked in the game, and lessen the bits that didn't.  So, while the focus is on the original <i>Traveller</i>, the project is about making that <i>Traveller</i> work -- because for whatever reason, it didn't work for me in the past.<br/><br/>Now, I get that ambitionless Wanderlust is a key concept of the original game.  It's called <i>Traveller</i> after all!  That the core of the game.<br/><br/>But I offer that that while it may have been the nub, it's also where the game fell down.  At least for me.  And lots of people I know.  I'm more than willing to believe your experience was different.<br/><br/>Because the common cycle of the failed <i>Traveller</i> game I've heard for years is: Referee generates subsetor, has a blast.  Players generate characters, have a blast.  Players and Referee sit down to play.  Everyone looks at everyone else expectantly.  Players finally say, "What do we do?"  The Referee answers, "Anything you want."<br/><br/>And the came crashes to a halt.  Space is too big.  The lack of direction overstuffs the imagination. Nothing happens.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the point of CT wasn't wanderlust. I'm saying, "It wasn't always that helpful to getting a game going."<br/><br/>For my version, if I need to tweak something to bring out the other parts that I did find interesting, that's what I'm going for.  I don't think it's <i>helpful</i> to the Players.  I don't think it's <i>helpful</i> to the GM.  And, in fact, I think it's harmful.<br/><br/>Now, part of this is about taste.  I have never responded well to characters who just want to get money.  I think it brings a raft of problems -- characters that aren't particularly interesting outside of their skill sets, characters that are in one way or another disconnected form anything we might consider "human."  (I believe it was a scenario you mentioned here where a PC shot any NPC with a bag of money in the face and took the money.  The NPC was offering the money for help.  The PC, since he only cared about money, made the wiser and more economical choice.)<br/><br/>I can say that the whole <i>Traveller</i> trap of having a bunch of amoral or immoral fucks who do whatever illegal or expedient thing that pops into their head really has little interest to me.  I'm not saying people don't have fun with it.  I'm not saying it wasn't what a lot of the GDW modules were about.  I'm saying it bores me.<br/><br/>I can also say, "I'm a story guy."  And in stories being a professional who gets a check, and only a professional who gets a check, is boring.  Look at drama, and it's never about how well a guy does his job.  From the Iliad to NYPD Blue, what matters is the stuff around the job, how that job affects the stuff, and how the stuff affects the job.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought the <i>Firefly</i> TV series was lame.  It was dull, <i>A-Team</i>-light.  I thought <i>Serenity</i> rocked.  (No surprise, I'm sure.)  I think if you take the pilot of the TV show and then cut directly to the movie, you have a really full evening of a cool SF story.  All the other episodes in between (except for a few near the end of the run) are basically fluff.  They meander.  They wander.<br/><br/>Now, again, some of this is taste.  And some of it <i>what works</i>.  I have found that Kickers and other Player created Flags work really well.  They focus the Player, focus the GM, get things going and going well.  <br/><br/>If I thought simply wandering around the stars worked <i>or</i> was interesting, I might be more interested in figuring this out.  <br/><br/>But my own reading of both literature and the history of the times that <i>Traveller</i> is mapped on from our Age of Empires suggests that Ambition is part of the key to get things going, keep things going, and keep the PCs from being amoral fucks.<br/><br/>Is this a departure from the central concept.  Absolutely.  But, of course, if everything had been working fine <i>I wouldn't be starting this project at all</i> -- I'd just use the LBBs!<br/><br/>So, yes, you are right.  But given what I've said above, it's a change that I'm not only willing to make, but one that I think is needed.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff" title="joshua neff"><img alt="joshua neff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.goblin-cartoons.com/images/lantern.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/joshua%20neff">joshua neff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98738/#Comment_98738" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:20:12+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 2:21PM by joshua neff.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I've been gone for a while, Mike.

Joss Whedon played a lot of Traveller when he was younger--at least, I read that somewhere when Firefly first went on the air (and then quickly went off again *sigh*). From what I've heard, Wash's line in the pilot, "Hang on, travellers!", is a reference to the game.<br/><br/>So, I agree that wanderlust is crucial to the game. I'm thinking that the PCs can't stop travelling, can't stop hopping from planet to planet, sailing the sea of stars. They just cannot settle down at all. Until Transcendence, and then the player narrates some ending, some sort of "she lived happily ever after as the President of Rydek IV" or "he opened up a food stall in Atlantis Downport and worked there every day until he couldn't stand up anymore." Transcendence would be...Retirement? Settling Down?<br/><br/>EDIT: I wrote &amp; posted this before I saw Christopher's latest post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98744/#Comment_98744" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:24:17+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah.

Seeing as how the urge to travel should be a big deal with Traveler, wouldn't a brace of Keys be appropriate?  The Key of the Explorer, of Itchy Feet, of the Next Horizon, of the Open Road?  If you wanted to make a statement about all the character's sharing this need to travel, maybe start with an initiation story, about how you bought off the Key of the Dirtsider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98749/#Comment_98749" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:32:26+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 2:39PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I better add fast -- um, traveling will be a big feature in the game.  <br/><br/>I mean, it's space.

He was doomed to fail, of course.  But he wasn't a man just trying to make money.  He was making money to purposefully keep himself safe from a civilization that had failed him and that he thought he had failed.<br/><br/>(Full disclosure: My reaction to <i>Firefly</i> is colored by the fact I saw <i>Serenity</i> first, said, "This rocks!" went out and got the DVDs and thought, "Oh...

I'm not advocating "Amoral Fucks" as the core of the game. Which you should see from that other thread that you reference. I'm believing what you have will work to fix all of those old problems. I simply have more faith in TSOY to fix this than, apparently, you do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, we're apparently in 100% agreement about how this will work with the exception of the naming of one of the three pools? I really doubt that this one thing could break the reinforcement of the sort of play that both of us would like to see. It's one mechanic, and not nearly as important as the Keys mechanic. You're worried, and rightly so, that play will devolve to that primitive "follow the money" style of passive play. You want players to drive play. But that's exactly what Keys do in play, is to incentivize players pushing play forward to get the XP. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only money-grubbers will be those that take the Key of Glittering Gold... and even they will be fun to follow. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the question of morality... I think that's a pretty central one for Traveller (in a universe of infinite cultures and beliefs, how do you choose one, why have morals?). Again, as you point out, it never came out in play of Classic Traveler, or MegaTraveller, or Hard Times, or TNE, or GURPS Traveller, T4, (I never tried T20), just like so many themes that should have; everyone just acted immorally for the most part. But I don't see how ambition would change that... in fact for some characters it's going to worsen the problem. But either way I don't think it'll matter, because there will be play that centers around the choices of whether or not to be moral, and how those choices are made. Even if they are immoral or amoral, that will be an interesting choice of play, not just the best tactical move. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't want to see that go, and I think that the difference in this one pool wouldn't make a shred of difference either way. <br/>\n<br/>\nKnow what? I didn't really like Firefly all that much either. But then again I wasn't playing any of the characters. If it had been closer to me, I think I could have engaged with it. In fact I'd go so far as to say that Wheedon really made the show like a recounting of RPG play... which never works to engage an audience. You have to be there actually playing for it to stick. But I think had I played that game that it would have worked for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you that the show worked only when, and the game works only when, we see the issues of each character come to light. Mal's wanderlust is, in fact, a manifestation of his motive to try to forget about his failure, about his belief that there's nothing left to do, and how he constantly fails to distance himself. It's about how the "bubble" keeps getting broken. It's like uncle Ronnie always says about the big tough-guy characters and anti-heroes... they always have a soft center that demands that they do right. Their tension is between their moral center telling them that they have to do things, and their experience telling them that getting involved is painful. They want to be apart from everybody in principle, but their morality keeps pulling them back. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn TSOY, that moral center will be their keys. Or stuff that revolves around their keys. Like... let's say that somebody does take the Key of Megacredits; there'll always be that temptation for the player to find that one thing that the character will give up money for, buying off the key. We can pose situations to the character that ask, "Just how greedy is this character, and just how far would he go to get money, and just how deep down is it to that moral center?" Does the character have any redeeming qualities? Maybe the answer is no, in fact, but then we'll have had an interesting time finding out how despicable this villain really is before we probably have him meet a fitting end. TSOY will see to all of this. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's if they don't take more moral keys like The Key of the Guardian, The Key of Faith, The Key of Conscience, The Key of Fraternity. And just because a character has wanderlust doesn't mean that can't actually be caused by ambition, too. There will be ambitious characters. Like the one who takes "Key of the Mission" who's mission is to discover the secrets of the ancients, or to uncover what he believes is a Zhodani plot. In this case the wanderlust is not some passive thing, but it's due directly to the need to keep moving about to discover more. The Key of Vengeance... who is the character persuing? Who knows, but he has to travel on quixotically in his attempt to find them. Key of the Vow... oh, man, what players will do with Key of the Vow in Traveller... maybe he's a noble who has vowed to bring his house up to prominence in the most ambitious fashion. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy having Wanderlust, I in no way preclude ambition. And where ambition may be lacking, the keys will still ensure engaging play. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, at a certain point if all you're talking about is a desire to have a particular sort of color... that's why I said "this is how I'd play it." I think that the idea of a game about ambition (especially if all of the characters are noble, or have other such interests) is a pretty cool central concept. I think it's just a small subset of what Traveller can do, and one that you don't need to limit players to in order to get proactive play. If you want that limit, then great. I'm just not seeing it as being neccessary for fun play. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want is to do what Traveller promised, but could not deliver, because of it's system. I don't think it's the wanderlust that kills play, I think it's 100% the system. You've already fixed that here, so I'm pretty confident it will work. In fact, I have to say that this has gotten me more inspired to play a RPG than any other game idea in the past 6 months. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope we can get past this one little issue and on to discussing the species and such that I'm posting... have I captured things correctly? Or are you into just making up keys and secrets at need? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98944/#Comment_98944" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T10:26:41+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 10:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ***Psionic Secrets***<br/>\n<br/>\nI was incorrect above, psionics are present in almost every species, with the exception of the Hivers (who, in fact, are so different as to be unaffected by any mental psionic power). Psionics is rare in non-humans in the Imperium, only because it's rare to begin with. Since the Psionic Suppressions following scandals in the Psionic Institute, the practice of psionics in the Imperium has been banned. And the populace of the Imperium carries strong biases against those who use Psionics. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the Psionic Institute exists, and will train individuals who have the talent for it. These individuals are very rare, it should be mentioned. And rarer so outside of humaniti. <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally for somebody to have an ability lower down on each of the lists, they have to have the lesser powers as well, first. So one cannot have Secret of Telempathy without first having Secret of Life Detection. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll psionic abilities cost Know How to use - I was thinking one point per level of psionic power. As a sort of technical effort, it seemed the closest to spending psionic points. Perhaps somebody has a better idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Telepathy Secrets**<br/>\nAbilities to read minds. <br/>\n - Secret of The Shield<br/>\n - Secret of Life Detection<br/>\n - Secret of Telempathy<br/>\n - Secret of Reading Surface Thoughts<br/>\n - Secret of Sending Thoughts<br/>\n - Secret of The Probe<br/>\n - Assault<br/>\n<br/>\n**Clairvoyance Secrets**<br/>\nAbility to sense beyond one's normal senses. <br/>\n - Secret of Sense<br/>\n - Secret of Clairvoyance<br/>\n - Secret of Clairaudiance<br/>\n - Secret of Both<br/>\n<br/>\n**Awareness Secrets**<br/>\nControl of one's own body. <br/>\n - Secret of Suspended Animation <br/>\n - Secret of Enhanced Strength <br/>\n - Secret of Enhanced Endurance <br/>\n - Secret of Regeneration  <br/>\n<br/>\n**Secret of Telekinesis**<br/>\nThere is only one ability here, and level of ability is all about how much one can push or lift. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Secret of Teleportation**<br/>\nThere is only one secret here, and the power of the ability has to do with the amount of distance that it's possible to teleport. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Special Psionic Secrets**<br/>\nThis last catchall is an excuse for players to devise their own psionic powers. Examples include:<br/>\n - abilty to spontaneously start fires (pyrokensis)<br/>\n - the ability to teleport others instead of one\xe2\u20ac\u2122s self<br/>\n - the ability to perform an assault on inanimate objects<br/>\n - the ability to telepathically communicate with computers or robots<br/>\n - the ability to induce visions or hallucinations in others (either audio, visual, or combined)<br/>\n - the ability to use awareness to affect others <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98950/#Comment_98950" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T10:52:49+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 10:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking that, perhaps, there should be no Imperial Culture in terms of it having it's own secrets and keys... I couldn't think of many that pertained to it directly. But...<br/>\n<br/>\n***Imperial Culture***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vast majority of the 14 Trillion citizens of the Imperium do not really have this culture, but instead have that of the homeworld upon which they exist. Most people never set foot off of the soil of the planet on which they were born, and so each homeworld tends to have it's own distinct culture. If you play one of those, one who has only recently left their homeworld (perhaps has only been through one term of service), you may want to make up a creative homeworld culture to represent what that world is like. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are a few who do leave the culture of their homeworld early enough to be inculcated in the somewhat generic interstellar culture of the imperium. And, of course, there are the nobility and wealthy who often live their entire lives in the interstellar culture. The Travellers, the characters that the players will run, will have military backgrounds that likely have had them in the interstellar culture since age 18. So any PC from the Imperium can have this culture, based on this fact alone. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Imperial Secrets**<br/>\n - Secret of Nobility<br/>\nThis secret grants it's owner the rights and privileges of a noble of the Imperium. It may be taken several times, each time it is taken moving one up the scale of power: <br/>\n*Knight<br/>\n*Baronet<br/>\n*Baron<br/>\n*Marquis<br/>\n*Viscount<br/>\n*Count<br/>\n*Duke<br/>\n*Archduke<br/>\n*Imperial Family<br/>\n<br/>\n **Imperial Keys**<br/>\n - Key of Cosmopolitanism<br/>\nThe character understands well that the Imperium is a place of many diverse cultures, and tries to get along well with as many as possible. Gain 1 XP for learning about somebody else's culture. Gain 2XP for following a local custom. Gain 5 XP for giving up something important in order to conform to somebody's culture. Buyoff: Insult somebody's culture, or refuse to find a part of it acceptable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98962/#Comment_98962" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:10:39+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now for my favorite Traveller aliens (OK I have several favorites, but...)<br/>\n<br/>\n***Bawapakerwa-a-a-awapawab***<br/>\n<br/>\nMore commonly referred to as "Newts" for the fact that they look a lot like bipedal newts (and most humans can't remember how to pronounce their full name). Newts are a minor race that can be found in small numbers all throughout the Imperium, often a civil servants. The Bwaps seem to have an ingrained world view that, even if they aren't from a Bwap culture primarily, they seem to cling to with few exceptions. It involves the notion that the entire universe is somehow intertwined, and that the only reasonable way to deal with it is through the employment of formalities. For this reason Newts are particularly suited to roles where such a regimen is part and parcel of the job. Hence, again, why they are found as bureaucrats more than in any other role in imperial society. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Newt Secrets**<br/>\n - Secret of Organization<br/>\nDue to their rigid patterns of work, Newts are able to keep organized information and materials in a way far superior and beyond the ken of humans. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of Humidity Tolerance<br/>\nNewts can exist in comfort with any level of humidity over 98% (a human might die of heat exhaustion while a Newt wouldn't even notice). Below that, they wear special garments that keep them hydrated. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Newt Keys**<br/>\n - Key of The Pattern<br/>\nMost Newts seem incapable of not following patterns and cycles. 1 XP act in a discernable pattern. 2 XP perform some exotic ritual that the newt feels must be performed to otherwise do something quite mundane (i.e. walk around the kitchen ten times before washing the dishes). 5 XP Jeopardize something important due to having to take extra time to do something in the "proper" fasion.

Sometimes I'm aggressive in my posting -- and sometimes I'm emphatic.  I know the difference when I'm posting, but of course that doesn't mean it's clear on the internet.<br/><br/>So, I was being emphatic.  I had a strong opinion about stuff and I was expressing it really strong.  It wasn't <i>against</i> anything you wanted to do.  It was me saying, "Stay on target" -- the target being my target.<br/><br/>As Clinton said, the Pools will have a lot to do with the shape of the game that's played.  Each game will have its own focus.  That said, I'm still turning "Wanderlust" around in my head.  It might simply not be the game I want -- I'll see.<br/><br/>I haven't had time to look at all the crazy work you're doing, but it looks great.  When I have time to actually read it all carefully, I'll comment.<br/><br/>And I'm really glad this has jazzed you. It's certainly jazzed me.<br/><br/>My focus right now (what little focus I have for it -- I'm hamming a script and getting reach for Mountain Witch next week) goes back to the matters Judson and I were talking about -- What is the reward for XP's and how do they tie into what I want the game to be about.  <br/><br/>You brought up  good notes -- Traveller had an advancement system...  but it kind of hung off the game like a withered limb. Also, the Traveller system was like, what?  You put in 100 hours of training and get a +1 to your rifle skill?  The TSOY advancement are much coarser than that. <br/><br/>The contacts is interesting, but I don't want people to be just a resource that magically appears.  If we have them springing up like mushrooms, that could happen.  What I do love is the idea that 10 XP buys you an NPC contact/dependent/whatever.  Maybe locking the NPC into play so its the GMs responsibility to keep the NPC in play -- like HeroQuest points used to cement NPCs.<br/><br/><i>Herm</i>.... like cementing people, objects and places like in HeroQuest.... that might be interesting...<br/><br/>Busy now.  Back later.<br/><br/>And Judson, still curious about your thoughts on Reserve Dice from my last post on matter.  <br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98973/#Comment_98973" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:38:02+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ***Hivers***<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the major race furthest different from humans, Hivers are hexepedal creatures with one of their appendages being a head-analogue. They are extremely intelligent creatures in general, and highly curious. This curiosity tends to manifest itself as a behavior known to humans as "Manipulation" which largely entails extensive social engineering experiments. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Secrets of the Hivers**<br/>\n - Secret of Curiosity<br/>\nHivers, once focused on something new to them, or which they have decided to study, become capable of complete focus. Hivers never have to make rolls to stay concentrated on something they are focused upon - even if, for example, they are being physically harmed. Their curiosity can overcome even their will to live.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**Keys of the Hivers**<br/>\n - Key of Manipulation<br/>\nOnce in a social situation, or in contact with one, many hivers simply cannot help themselves but must try to alter the dynamics in some fashion. Gain 1 EX if the Hiver manages to change somebody's mind in a way that fits his intended manipulation. Gain 2EX if the hiver starts up some sort of behavior in a group that is part of his manipulation plan. Gain 5 EX if the hiver manages to have pulled off a full manipulation of a group - something about it's entire dynamic is permanently and substantialy changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98983/#Comment_98983" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T12:02:18+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 12:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there was no ability advancement rule it wouldn't be a terrible thing in my book. I'm just thinking to allow it, but make other stuff at least as cool, so that it was something taken relatively infrequently as an advance. But that's a quibble. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for "cementing" I'm not seeing the difference here, really. Are you saying you really don't want players making up NPCs? If so, why not? I love the notion of a player coming up with his old buddy who works at the spaceport to which they're headed, or the ex-admiral's contact in the Imperial Navy Intelligence organization. This idea was actually the center of the idea that I was working on in that earlier thread. This makes the universe not just a place to be explored, but a place to which the character has connections. The girl in every port, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end we're talking about an NPC who the player can sometimes rely upon to get things done. Which is important in Traveller, because while rugged individualism will serve well in the frontier parts of the setting (of which there's plenty), in the established areas, getting things done is on a scale where I'd think that the characters would need help from time to time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the way I'm seeing it working would be a bit like your idea for having to come up with stories in certain terms of service. Basically when a player arrives in a system, he has to speficy if his character has ever been there before, and if so, why. If he has, then he can establish contacts there. Otherwise he can't. Maybe the player has to spend an advance to say that he's been somewhere before... and if he has been there, then he gains some authorship over the nature of that system. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to distribute the creativity for the setting over all of the players. So that starts with NPC contacts, which attach these otherwise wandering characters to the setting (instead of truely drifting with just each other), and then maybe moving on to more ownership. Again, this can be used, too, to create that stress between the will to wander, and the need to deal with issues that affect the people for whom you care. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think player creation is critical, in fact, for equipment (thanks Josh). Because the limited lists of equipment were one of the most frustrating things about Traveller... you quickly ran out of new gadgets, and the ones that were presented weren't even all that high-tech very often. If you allow players to invent what they need, then the universe of gadgets expands dramatically and at need. I think it's a really important enhancement (thanks Luke!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI really can't think of any other rewards... Traveller had stuff, certainly. I'd advocate adding people (NPCs) as rewards. And there's always the keys and secrets, of course. I think that'll probably be good enough for me, at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>TSOY/Traveller Home-Brew - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4341/tsoy-traveller-home-brew/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="TSOY/Traveller Home-Brew - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4341/tsoy-traveller-home-brew/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Oh, on the subject of the Reserve Dice... yeah, if they're fire-and-forget, I like that.

The race bases it's social structure off of it's male members, despite the fact that they do not seem to be as intelligent in most ways as the females. Indeed the males have a drive to control land that borders on the purely instinctual. As such, males are really only good as warriors and as politicos, while the females of the species perform all other functions. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Aslan Secrets**<br/>\n - Secret of the Dewclaw<br/>\nLike Dro, the Aslan are possessed of a dewclaw as natural weaponry. Works like the Vargr natural weaponry secret, which works like the goblin one. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of the Warrior<br/>\nAslan are otherwise built well to win physical combats, as well as being instinctual combatants. They gain one die in any conflict. <br/>\n<br/>\n**Aslan Keys**<br/>\n - Key of Land<br/>\nMost Aslan are persuing land in one way or another, even if it looks like they're after something else. Gain 1 EX for gaining something that is a step towards gaining land. Gain 2 EX for making a risky move to get land. Gain 5 EX for aquiring a substantial chunk of desirable land. Buyoff: Give up on an opportunity to persue getting land. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Note that these all seem to apply very much to the male side, but as extensions of the males, societally, female Aslan could have them. I'm often not sure where the species notes should end, and the cultural notes should start. So...)<br/>\n<br/>\n**Aslan Cultural Key**<br/>\n - Key of Pride<br/>\nAslan tend to be a very proud race, always looking to gain honor for their familiy. Gain 1 EX when acting aloof. Gain 2 EX when doing something in order to prove their racial strength. Gain 5 EX when taking a personal risk in the name of pride.

Which is pretty much the Reserve Dice.<br/><br/>So, I'm thinking of leaving the Advancement Table as is, but increasing the XP ratio 10 XP to 1 Advance.<br/><br/>During character creation, your first term gets the basics for Abilities and Secrets per the basic character generation rules.  You also get 2 Advances per odd numbered terms, and 3 Advances on the even numbered terms.  You also get a final Advance and a Key when you muster out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If people want to increase their Streetwise Ability, why would I stop them?  But the Secrets are cool, equipment and contacts are going to matter a lot.  You have to buy a new Secret for each Imbuement, as per the standard rules.  I would break out Secret of Contacts so there's one required for each Contact, rather than have one for any and all contacts as the rules currently stand.  <br/><br/>To gets cooler equipment, more contacts and such, the Players will have to distribute XP across a broader range of Secrets.  This is will hold down Ability inflation, I suspect.

I didn't realize you hadn't actually played TSoY!  <br/><br/>I'd still tone down Gift Dice - they add a huge free wheeling element that works great in the World of Near, but that seems weird for Traveler.  <br/><br/>I think Reserve Dice make a certain sense, so long as they're a cheaper alternative to buying pools up - two per advance, or shift Pools so that they scale kinda like Abilities do (half the new value, maybe?) because all the Secrets that allow for unlimited Pool expenditure are pretty situation-specific.  Especially if you keep in mind that you get XP per scene and can spend Advances during play, Reserve Dice then become a pretty huge temptation.  There's a tricky balance to strike though, between the flexibility of Reserve Dice and their one-shot nature <i>vis-a-vis</i> buying up a Pool.  <br/><br/>Here's a weird thought: what if Reserve Dice can be spent on any roll (i.e. not tied to a Pool), and when you spend an Advance you get one Reserve and one Gift Die, with no free Gifts.<br/><br/>As to Secret of Contacts - TSoY is built around character interaction, which is why Contacts is so cheap.  Ultimately, though, it's a lot of fun to be able to forge relationships with NPCs pretty much at will.  It gives characters a very integrated feel.  I'd almost suggest making Contacts mandatory for certain services, the way that Elves and Goblins have mandatory Secrets in TSoY.  If you're concerned about making NPC associations too easy, I'd recommend a half-measure of splitting out Contacts by service: Secret of (Service) Contacts.  <br/><br/>It's funny, I feel like the Solar System Adviser on the project, and like I should be going to lunch with Mike so we can hash out the mid-grounds between Traveler and TSoY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99117/#Comment_99117" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T21:12:35+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  9:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Count me in for the tailored crack.  :-)<br/><br/>What about Imperial Keys related to feudal relationships?

The lists in the book are suggestions to get started.<br/><br/>I am going to make an adjustment to the XP ratio (10XP :1 Advance), and add in extra Advances for extra terms of service.  <br/><br/>I'll come up with some extra Keys, Secrets and Abilities appropriate for the setting (Mike's made a ton of suggestions, and things like Key of the Oath are brilliant) so the players have good examples for the setting when they make characters.<br/><br/>Other than that, I think it'll be good to go.  <br/><br/><br/>Oh, and Judson: Gift Dice and Traveller.  I get that it might not be right for the "genre" (or whatever the fuck <i>Traveller</i> is!)  But they are very important for the GROUP, as far as I'm concerned.  And the group, in play, is what it all about for me.  So for now they'll stay.  We'll see how it works.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99135/#Comment_99135" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T23:32:16+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random idea:  To spend experience, you must narrate a year of down-time.

It may be a terminological issue. As I had it, you spend some number of XP (usually 5) to get an "advance." And then these are spent on buying whatever - a new secret, new key, new ability die... But I probably have that wrong. I'm also probably confused by the fact that I'm more conversant with the first edition of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's what I'm thinking right now:<br/>\n1 XP - reserve die<br/>\n5 XP - new key or secret or pool die<br/>\n10 XP - raise ability one level<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first item might be a bit radical, but basically it's saying that you can burn XP for an equal number of dice as you need them. You wouldn't bother buying the dice before hand, but only as you felt you needed them. Alternately these would have to be purchased before the contest, or they couldn't be used. Not sure that's in the spirit of TSOY, however. OTOH, as Judson is pointing out, and you have too, Chris, this might all be unbalancing and all unneccessary. If Secrets and Keys are cheaper, that might do the trick, with players buying stuff that fuel the pools in more tailored fashion than a generic reserve would. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like Simon's idea, something to push the aging clock forward at a steady pace. The problem is that things like keys should be changing on the fly... So how about this? When you spend XP, it accumulates "stress"; one point of stress per 5 XP spent. Stress has to be spent down by narrating downtimes. If stress reaches 10, the character must either retire, or die. Stress must be spent down to zero, or not at all. The length of the downtime depends on how much stress is being spent down:<br/>\n<br/>\nStress  Time<br/>\n1         Two weeks<br/>\n2         One month <br/>\n3         Two months<br/>\n4         Five months<br/>\n5         One year<br/>\n6         Two years<br/>\n7         Five Years<br/>\n8         Ten Years<br/>\n9         Twenty Years<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever downtime is taken, it's taken for all PCs, for a duration equal to that for the highest stress character, and all PCs have their stress reduced to zero. This gives an incentive to describe downtime as frequently as possible, and not to less stress build up. At some point, if stress does build up, there'll be a strong push to have that character just go to ten and retire (don't make the group all take 20 years!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr something of this nature. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis would replace the transcendance mechanic, which seems likely never to come into play as the rules are currently designed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the Gift dice are given for whatever is appropriate, and will be given for stuff appropriate to Traveller. Truth be told, I do want feats of active derring-do... I just want that to be something that many of the characters complain about afterwards. Like:<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Strabili: Oh, no, we're not transporting any more exotic animals any more. Remember the last time? When they broke out, got all over the ship, and it became a rodeo trying to wrangle them all back into the containment devices? There's no way that I'm going to...<br/>\n<br/>\nSteward Johnstron: Uh Cap? Did I mention that he said that the guy who wants the animals transported said that he'd talk to the Duke about getting a pardon for your daughter? <br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Strabili: Uhhhhn. Farglecarb! All right, damnit, but we're making double sure this time that the containment units remain shut! You get to do extra guard duty down there.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstron: But what did I do? Aw man. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen adventure ensues this time as some eco-terrorists try to take over the ship to take it to a reserve world where they can let the animals loose, with Gift Dice a flying, as the Captain uses his Know How to organize an end-around assault by going outside the ship in Vacc Suits while in Jump space, intending to using explosives to breach the hull right where the terrorists are holding out, but where they end up in a laser battle as the terrorists have a plant in the remaining passengers who inform them that the captain is coming (that pretty girl who's been chatting up the captain since the ship went into jump space). <br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstron: I told you that the NAS sensor readings indicated that they were on the outside!<br/>\n<br/>\nCap: Shut up and patch this damn hole in my suit while I keep their heads down! <br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstron: I told you that swinging around like that on the saftey wire was going to bring you into contact with the jumpspace event horizon!<br/>\n<br/>\nCap: Johnstron... you're fired!<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstron: What is that, like the fifth time this month you've fired me?<br/>\n<br/>\nCap: Just shut up, fix the suit, and lay down some suppressive fire so I can charge them, danmit! This is just like that time on the "High Lightning". Doc, bring the medkit, I think I lost a bit of my shoulder, too! OK, hole's fixed? Then set off the grenade under the plate... that should send me flying over the fin and their heads so I can get a clear shot. Ready? Go!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCan't you just see the gift dice flying around in this example? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99195/#Comment_99195" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T08:15:28+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  8:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Chris, not sure I'm getting the costs.

You're saying to start them further on, but then slow them down by doubling the cost for new Advances (where that term means "pushing up the level of an ability"). So that the "average" for play will be about the same as normal TSOY over time. That makes sense to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple of random secrets I thought up:<br/>\n - Secret of the Megacorp<br/>\nThe character is an important employee of, or is otherwise associated with a megacorp, such that they can bring to bear some of the mighty resources of such an organization on whatever problems they encounter. The player should select the megacorporation with which the character is associated. If the character makes a roll to convince his superiors of the need (a preliminary roll), he may add up to 4 Know How dice for use in any contests dealing with the problem in question.  <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of Robotic Body<br/>\nThe character is, secretly, an intelligent robot (possibly even pseudo-biological). These are rare, as there are prejudices against them from the outcome of the Shudusham Concords (http://traveller.wikia.com/wiki/Shudusham_Concords), and also, simply, because they are new and expensive. A character who is a robot of this sort has the advantage that damage to it may be repaired relatively quickly, assuming parts and tools are on hand. Maybe more importantly, with regular maintainence they do not suffer any effects of aging. Many other secrets can be purchased for such a character, using the robotic body as the explanation - but these must be purchased separately, and reflect features of the model in question. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of the Scout Ship<br/>\nThe character must have been in the Scouts, and now has access to a surpluss Type S Scout/Courier ship. This comes with the standard obligations and restrictions on such use. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of the Merchant Ship<br/>\nThe character must hve been in the Merchant service, and has managed to obtain either a Free Trader or a Far Trader merchant ship. Taking this once means that the ship's mortgage is brand new, with 40 years to pay on it. For each additional time this is taken, 10 years worth of mortgage have been paid off on the ship. Thus, with five such secrets, the character owns the ship free and clear (though the ship is likely old). <br/>\n<br/>\nThese last two I put out there to try to get the discussion going again about the question of ship ownership... is this the right sort of approach? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99216/#Comment_99216" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T09:38:45+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  9:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole ship thing is central to the game - I recall paying down that mortgage being pretty much all we cared about, back in the day.

That's very clean.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, the ship thing... if you ain't got a ship, you're just a dirtsider like everybody else. At best you're crew, but then you don't get to choose where to go. The ship means freedom. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to think up Keys, but not coming up that's Traveller specific, and not covered by the various Keys already in TSOY (which, with little modification, are remarkably generic). Like I was going to write up a "Key of Ambition" to show Chris that ambition could be in the game, but it's pretty much already in there as Key of Power. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to be fair, this one isn't in TSOY:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Key of Wanderlust<br/>\nYour character doesn't like to stay in one place for too long for whatever reason. They will seek to keep moving from place to place, perhaps not even certain what it is that they're looking for (if they know, then it may be Key of Vengeance or Key of the Mission). Gain 1 EX for expressing discomfort at being confined, or longing for the road. Gain 2EX when taking steps to ensure that the current stay will be short. Gain 5 EX every time the character moves on from something he cares about. Buyoff: Decide to make one place home indefinitely. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecrets, on the other hand, these are coming to me in spades:<br/>\n - Secret of the Secrets of the Ancients<br/>\nThe character is aware of the secrets of the Ancients (things like that they're still around). <br/>\n<br/>\n - Secret of Extrality (This is a Traveller term that refers to the fact that starports usually have extra-territorality from the worlds on which they can be found, given that they are usually Imperial assets)<br/>\nThe character has no official identity on any system, and exists only as a ghost in the imperial databases, which have hardly any information on the character, and nothing on his homeworld of origin. C.F. Sinless in Shadowrun, or Zeroed in GURPS. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99247/#Comment_99247" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T12:35:07+00:00" title="September 26, 2007 12:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an example of a homeworld culture (again to be assigned to a character who hasn't quite picked up the Imperial culture yet):<br/>\n<br/>\n***Porozlo***<br/>\nPorozlo's biggest claim to fame is that it sports the one of the highest populations of sentient beings in the spinward marches: approx. 90 Billion inhabitants. It also has the highest number of polities, with some 80 nations claiming soverignty (and that number is much lower than it once was, due to wars of consolidation). As such it is hard to say any one thing about the people of Porozlo as a whole... players may wish to make up national cultures. But they do all have one thing in common:<br/>\n<br/>\n**Porozlo Keys**<br/>\n - Key of Intollerance<br/>\nPorozlo inhabitants all tend to think in very local, parochial, terms. Even the members of the other nations of their world are to be suspected... to say nothing of somebody from another planet or system entirely. Gain 1 EX when speaking intollerantly about somebody when they are in earshot. Gain 2 EX for acting against somebody who is not from your culture... simply because they are different. Gain 5 EX for the character getting into a fight due to their intollerance. Buyoff: Be accepting of somebody very different. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Darrians***<br/>\nAs a species, Darrians are simply humans, and get no special species secrets (pointy ears notwithstanding). <br/>\n<br/>\n***Darrian Confederation*** <br/>\nThe Darrian Confederation is a union of worlds controlled by racial and ethinic Darrians. They are allies of the Imperium, and are known for their exceedingly high level of technology.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Darrian Confederation Secrets**<br/>\n - Secret of High Tech<br/>\nThough probably not really capable of producing a lot of high tech items beyond the ability of Imperial worlds, the Darrians have always hovered around the ability to do so, and one can frequently find examples of their handiwork at this level of technology if one looks hard enough (don't even ask about the Star Trigger). Unsurprisingly, Darrians tend not to allow this technology to get into the hands of non-Darrians. This secret allows the character to obtain tech level 16 equipment (though generally the secret of imbuement or similar rule must be purchased to obtain the specific abilities indicated). <br/>\n<br/>\n**Darrian Keys**<br/>\n - Key of Stoic Aloofness<br/>\nThe Darrians are not really snobby, but they are stoic to the point where they tend to remove themselves from the trials and tribulations of other races. Gain 1 EX if the character ignores somebody else's problem. Gain 2 EX if the character refuses to deal with somebody else's problem, even when asked nicely. Gain 5 EX if the character allows something bad to happen to something he cares for, simply to show how aloof he is.

The game is versatile.<br/><br/>But that's not the question.  The question is, "What is the definition of the game? What is the definition of a person in in this game?"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>Christopher,<br/><br/>Pools are what make up a person in the game. They are prerequisites for person-hood. In TSOY, without Vigor, Instinct, and Reason, you are not a person. This holds for adventure swords and sorcery, but what about other settings? I could see a game of TSOY set in, say, the Crusades, that used God, Man, and the Devil as pools. Or, a fairly hard sci-fi game with Vision, Craft, and Intuition as pools.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure more pools won't work. Two might work pretty well, though - but I haven't tried it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>Christopher,<br/><br/>One time, I thought I should write a book on how to customize TSOY for your setting. I don't have time, but here's what you do:<br/><br/>- Change the pools. *Definitely* change the pools. They define your setting.<br/>- Ah, the abilities. Only change ones that obviously don't fit. I thought about those more than you'd think.<br/>- Secrets. Secrets are my sacred cow, and one I should have killed. I'm glad I didn't - I love 'em - but they're not that useful. A handful of them do everything. Use Secret of Imbuement for almost everything, and the Secrets of Blessing, Enhancement, and Specialty for everything else. The species secrets are cool for color - maybe add those in to whatever setting you have.<br/>- Keys are easily mixed between the core keys and ones you need for your setting. That's pretty easy to do.</blockquote>\nSo, the real question is, how does one group want to define the world and the person of their <i>Traveller</i> game.  The issue isn't whether or not a TSOY/Traveller hack can handle Wanderlust or Ambition.  Of course it can.   The issue is only one of emphasis -- what is considered central to the world and to play.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced this is an issue that has to be nailed down.  Your group might be focused in part on Wanderlust.  Mine, Ambition.  Sweet!<br/><br/>In the nearby <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4395&amp;page=1#Item_19" rel="nofollow">Go Anywhere, Do Anything</a> thread, Simon is working hard to make Wanderlust viable.  I think it's a path toward madness.  I think there are often our ideals of what we want our RPG experience to be like, and then the reality of what sitting down to play a game actually is.  Simon's looking for that experience of reading "The Lord of the Rings."  As Joshua Newman points out in that thread, playing an RPG is more like the process of creating the tales of Middle-Earth than bumping into story that's had all the rough edges and process of creativity smoothed out after the fact.  The expectation of simply going from world to world is a dear one to all of our hearts -- but how will it work in actual play?<br/><br/>And more to the point, what else is works that will produce similar effect that actually works?  I offer focusing on character drives of one kind or another.  These have worked well as Kickers in <i>Sorcerer</i>, the job in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, Issues in <i>Primetime Adventures </i>and so on.  The color of the world is there to support the narrative drive of character based play that I think is almost required when the color can change as swiftly as it does in <i>Traveller</i>.  (I'd say that a group committed to building and exploring one world -- going deeper and deeper each week into play -- is a whole different kettle of creative fish, and allowed the possibility of successful Sim play.)<br/><br/>Further, I find Wanderlust as a motivation, as stated above, kind of dull when contrasted to a character who actually is trying to get somewhere.<br/><br/>Finally, in the world of play I'm envisioning, Ambition is who these characters are, not Wanderlust.  Wanderlust is a symptom, a behavior, yes, but it isn't one of the defining qualities of the characters I want to interact with as a GM.<br/><br/>Here's some dialogue from "The Man Who Would Be King":<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-family: Courier;">PEACHY CARNEHAN: Home to what? A porters uniform outside a restaurant and six penny tips from belching civilians for closing cab doors on their blowzy women?<br/><br/>DANIEL DRAVOT: Not for us thank you. Not after watching Afghans come howling down out of the hills and taking battlefield command when all the officers copped it.<br/><br/>PEACHY CARNEHAN: Well said, brother Dravot. </span><br/><br/><br/>I want THAT.  I want the rules to define those guys.  I want the rules to define THAT world.<br/><br/>I want Captain Sir Richard Burton wandering the Congo because he hasn't found the recognition he desires.  I want Han Solo working his ass of to get free of his payments so he can be his own man.  I want a marine General who wants to take back that world the Imperium considers lost.  I want the tensions the the class system of <i>Traveller</i> implies -- not someone who can wander away from his frustrations, but someone who feels them gnawing at him all the time.  I want a group of guys bound to each other through blood and sweat, aiding each other in ambitious plans that no one else would help them with or think would work.<br/><br/>And, if nothing else, Imperial Ages are about Ambition.  And I want the rules I want to use for <i>Traveller</i> to key in on that.  The Imperial angle was one of the things that drew me to <i>Traveller</i>.  But so much of the implied setting was this antiseptic, bureaucratic, paper-pushing cubicle-land.  Ugh.  No, no, no -- Imperial age.  Movies like <i>The Four Feathers</i>, <i>Elizabeth</i> and even <i>The Sea Hawk</i> are the kinds of things I'm talking about.  I really feel that the Imperial Age was lost in a lot of the <i>Traveller</i> material, and I want to do anything I can to heighten that.<br/><br/>Now I understand you want something different.  Or at least a different focus.  Cool!  <br/><br/>But I don't think this has to be nailed down.  I think the Pool descriptions, as Clinton notes, are variables that establish the world and what makes a person a person.  In my <i>Traveller</i>, one of the qualities that makes a person a person is Ambition.  In your <i>Traveller</i> it's Wanderlust.  <br/><br/>Excellent!<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99486/#Comment_99486" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T09:57:02+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  9:57AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2007 10:01AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, I'm not seeing where we're disagreeing all that much.

For a steampunk/swashbuckling game, we didn't change the terms at all, though Instinct drifted in play slightly more towards Intuition perhaps.<br/><br/>Now refresh scenes (of course based on their pools) made for some terrifically, surprisingly fun scenes. My players really got into those, not breezing past them as I expected. They're one reason I woudn't have different characters have different pools - watching two player's takes on a Vigor refresh while at a society do was fascinating. Perhaps this is the sort of stuff Clinton sphinxly alludes to. And Christopher, I'd recommend you give refreshes plenty of thought.<br/><br/>We swapped out some abilities, for sure. We kept the feel of certain existing abilities - the way Blades covers weapons as well as cooking, for example. That felt important.<br/><br/>Players seemed mostly driven (reacting, solving, framing) by their primary two or three abilities, only one or two of their Keys (I find it hard keeping more than that in my head) and a secret.<br/><br/>Swapping out Keys for other Keys was also vital, of course (we assumed 10xp for a buyoff, 10xp for an advance, 10xp for a new key, but other groups offer new keys at 5xps *and* buyoffs at 10.

But it presents a potential issue in coordination between players and GM.  Especially when the GM is the prime facilitator of a game for players who aren't as familiar with the rules, it adds a level of difficulty to say - "Remember your Secret lets you spend a point from your Ambition pool...err, wait - do you have Ambition or something else written down?"<br/><br/>I know this has been a problem for me in games that encourage players to define their own names for stats and abilities - suddenly everything becomes confused when I'm trying to explain how the game functions.

I'm assuming more ideas will come to people, and they'll post.  But I think I've got enough to go on.<br/><br/>My notion now is keep the rules as much as possible to the rules as they stand.  I'm pretty sure I don't want to have tons of new Secrets, Keys or Abilities.  The rules as they stand pretty much cover everything.  I think the second quote I have from Clinton in the post above covers my agenda on this.<br/><br/>I've got some ideas based off the SOTC homebrew linked to upthread about how I want to handle ships, and I've commented on that already. I"m pretty sure I don't want the players tracking Credits in a weekly manner.  The trick for me is to have an economic abstraction that offers trouble to arrive with their ship, but it should be something that ARRIVES (you're going to have to do something for fuel before the authorities find you) like a Bang, and not a sim checkbook issue.  I'll tweak that and see what I can come up with in play.<br/><br/>If others want to add more to the thread, that's cool.  Mike's already going gangbusters on all the Keys and Secrets of other races.

My rhetorical style always says stuff like, "Nooo, you can't do it that way, it's gotta be this way!" But that's just me being enthusiastic about the idea I've got in my head, not really saying that the other idea is wrong in any way. <br/>\n<br/>\nJason... I think that's a good third option, to have the pools defined for each player individually. I'm not sure it's what I'd want, but I am sure it will work, too. Sorry, Flynn, I've never had the problem that you're talking about. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoe, yeah, I think that the pools are informative in precisely the way you mention: in terms of the refresh scenes. But that most character decisions, and what drives play are, especially, those two keys. Wanderlust, Ambition, whaever... if you have the Key of Cowardice, and it's what interests you about that character, that's going to drive play more than anything else. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I still want to post more Traveller notes on secrets and keys, because... well... it's a heap o fun. Chris, are they helpful to you at all? Just as inspirado, if nothing else? I'm hoping, actually, that people will come along and correct them where they think they should be different than they are. I'm throwing this stuff out pretty fast, and it's bound to be a bit schlocky.

I probably am going a bit overboard, but I'm thinking of this material as more inspirational than actually meant to be included in actual play neccessarily. My guideline is not to try to replicate everything from Traveller (that'd take years), but to provide as much stuff as you find for Near in TSOY. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm getting close already. Several species, several cultures, several generic keys and such. The homeworld example for Porozlo is meant to show how to make your own homeworld, not to try to be encyclopedic about all 11,000 worlds or anything. Interestingly, the number of homeworlds that are enumerated in enough detail to make a reasonable homeworld culture from are pretty few. Given that the authors didn't tend to dwell a lot on the cultures of the planets. <br/>\n<br/>\nBack when we did that other thread, I went back and read through the LBBs, trying to figure out how much of what I knew as in there, and how much was from sources that followed those books. I was interested to find some things that are in the books that I didn't expect, and other things I did expect to be there are completely absent. Take the aliens... nothing about any of them in the LBBs. The Vargr, really central as the stock alien, was introduced right thereafter, in Double Adventure 1, JTAS 8, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, they're technically not part of LBB Traveller... but I have to admit that part of my reason to play is actually to get the Third Imperium, with much of it's trappings. My hope is that I can treat the tons of supplemental material I own (pretty much all of it, including periodicals), as simply inspiration, too. That is, we'll let the setting form itself around the PCs, but we'll just have all of that supplemental material as stuff to inject as we need (or just want it) to flesh out the environs. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it's just that I spent a couple thousand dollars on it all, and I'm trying to finally get back a really good return on my investment? Perhaps.
