Angels loom outside the village - powerful, hungry, and demanding. They protect you from threats and you worship them, but at the same time sometimes they must be killed off for the good of the village. Everything is for the good of the village. You play the religious elite of this village: the priests who ordain the sacrifices, the executioners who ordain the purges, the temple guards who defend the pure, and the marked - those who will one day rupture into angels themselves. It is you that will decide the fate of this small village upon the river.<br/><br/>It's kinda like a mixture of Dark Sun and Warhammer Fantasy and cannibalism and dark twistedness.<br/><br/>Unicorns don't have a birth canal capable of delivering young. That's why unicorns have horns, so that they can puncture their way out of their mother's stomach when they reach full gestation.<br/><br/>So, anyways... that's background. Feel free to comment, but the questions are to follow.<br/><br/>The game has a traditional structure in some ways: There is GM who does prep between sessions, authors external opposition, and does a fairly large bit of scene setting. The other players form a party, and they will tackle the situations that are presented to them. There are classes (Priest, Temple Guard, Executioner, Marked).<br/><br/>There are a few ways in which I'm striving to be different from 'that', though. The classes are all connected and tied to a specific situation and setting (religious elite in a dying village). Prep consists of preparing situations more than linear adventures - the fact that the PCs have a physical and relational anchor point is part of this.<br/><br/>My idea is that the GM preps a bunch of enemies, their plans, and their demands. The PCs decide how to meet all of these. I want to explore ways to prep SITUATIONS rather than... stories/progressions/dungeons.<br/><br/>The system itself is really nonexistant at this point (read: all suggestions are probably valid right now), and I'm going to focus a lot of "what happens" on this...<br/><br/>So, I want a way of creating situations that allows players to take different approaches and <i>face different pressures from the same sources, depending on their approaches</i>.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>The advance scouts for a huge orc horde approach the village. They are slimey, rotten creatures. They have a demand: give them access to your women, and they'll fail to inform the horde that this village even exists. The GM has prepped the orcs for combat, for negotiation, for running back to the Horde. The Horde also sits prepped, and it is prepped for all-out war, for slave trading, or for prolongued siege (cutting off trade routes, poisoning water supplies, etc). By this point in the game the players know that orcs are competitive, restless and often turn on each other.<br/><br/>There are many options here: Options that include bartering with the scouts, killing the scouts, taking the scouts hostage, counter-assaulting the horde, defending the village against the horde, moving before the horde reaches them, as well as other things I'm not thinking about.<br/><br/>The basic idea here is that even with combat-heavy situations, you prep not for war but for alternatives. I'm talking about prepping resources more than anything here. The equivalent of maps and stat blocks in something like d&amp;d.<br/><br/>Now... enter the problem:<br/>I don't want a GM sitting there prepping 1,000,000 possibilities and what resources he/she will have in each instance. That'd  be lame and non-fun.<br/><br/>Now, enter the question:<br/>How can I achieve the "prepping multi-ended situations" feat without getting bogged down in the "spend hours thinking up all possibilties" suckage?<br/><br/>Now, enter the way you can help me:<br/>Give me some tangible examples of how to work this. Feel free to just invent a system or the pieces of a system needed to demonstrate your idea. (ie, "You have six traits, and they are...")<br/><br/>You can either give me examples of how this kind of thing is done in other games, or preferably create some possibilities for doing this in this game. I'll post right after this with one possibility I thought up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66501/#Comment_66501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T23:32:32+00:00" title="May  1, 2007 11:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2007 11:38PM by Mcdaldno.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought is you break prep-able stuff into categories. Anything that could be used to oppose the PCs fits a category. These include: Group, Character, Angel, Proposition, Aggression.<br/><br/>Any prepped "entity" will have the four basic point pools, as well as some traits listed on the catergory traits page.<br/><br/>The four basic point pools are:<br/>Vicious<br/>Persistent<br/>Songlike<br/>Untold<br/><br/>Note here that a Character and his Aggression (attacks) are seperate entities. This means that Blacktooth the Orc is distinctly seperate from his Raging Warrior Attack.<br/><br/>The idea here is that when you face Blacktooth the Orc, he gets resources for Blacktooth the Orc (Character). Whenyou face Blacktooth the Orc in combat, he gets resources for Blacktooth the Orc (Character) and Raging Warrior Attack (Aggression).<br/><br/><br/>A session's worth of prep might look like:<br/><br/><br/>The Orc Vanguard Approaches<br/>Group<br/>Vicious 4, Persistent 3, Songlike 2, Untold 1<br/>Anxious Mob, At Odds With Itself, Harbingers.<br/><br/>......................................A Deal to Make: We Want Your Women<br/>......................................Proposition<br/>......................................Vicious 2, Persistent 0, Songlike 4, Untold 1<br/>......................................A Small Sacrifice, Purity Lost, Unreliable<br/><br/>......................................Shadow Warriors<br/>......................................Aggression<br/>......................................Vicious 4, Persistent 1, Songlike 1, Untold 3<br/>......................................The Dark of Night, Cobra Fangs, Poison Daggers<br/><br/>The Orc Army Lays In Wait<br/>Group<br/>Vicious 6, Persistent 4, Songlike 1, Untold 0<br/>Anxious Mob, Warsingers, Orcish Warsong<br/><br/>......................................Blacktooth the Orc<br/>......................................Person <br/>......................................Vicious 2, Persistant 3, Songlike 1, Untold 0<br/>......................................Cobra Fangs, Unflinching, Makes Examples<br/><br/>...................................................Raging Warrior Attack<br/>...................................................Aggression<br/>...................................................Vicious 3, Persistant 0, Songlike 0, Untold 0<br/>...................................................Cobra Fangs<br/><br/><br/>......................................Warsinger Pailmouth<br/>......................................Person<br/>......................................Vicious 1, Persistent 3, Songlike 5, Untold 2<br/>......................................Warsinger, Orcish Warsong, Blind, Devote<br/><br/>(Edited for formating)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66514/#Comment_66514" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T04:34:22+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  4:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Joe, just to throw this out there - if this is a mythopoetic fantasy past, there's no compelling reason not to constrain choices.  Maybe, quite literally, there are only four ways to approach any conflict.  You can Fight, you can Talk, you can Run, you can Pray.
