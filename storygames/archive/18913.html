I am talking about a game which is not yet out in the open in its full glory but I feel we can have a really good grasp of its basics by looking at <a href="http://dig1000holes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/the-city-of-fire-and-coin-preview-version-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">The City of Fire and Coin</a>--which is a wonderful play&amp;learn-by-read adventure--and Epidiah Ravachol's posts on the <a href="http://dig1000holes.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">publisher's (basically his) site</a>.<br/>All that said, I feel a burning desire to understand these very basics more fully. The more direct one is about failing. On some specific conditions, failing (doubles, being stymied) seems a bit out of place for me. These occassions are:<br/> - when your rogue's Trick is being knowledgeable about something (like Manyara in the demo adventure), so you show it by forcing a Discovery Phase and that you are asked, handed the dice<br/> - when in a Rogue Phase, no matter if it's for a Trick or not<br/>These two are situations when I understand the rules as you really want to show some strength of your character and I don't see how can you do that with a failure (double, stymy). So what is your opinion on this?<br/><br/>A completely unrelated thing with this game I find hard is the incorporation of prep. Now, I guess this is much harder than the previous one as there are much less rules and hints already publicated regarding this side of the game. The game gives the players so big freedom that it's an incentive in itself to build the world, the story from the ground up. How can you prep and incentivize the others using your prep as a base for their play?<br/><br/>Thank you in advance for your honest advice and thoughts!<br/><br/>Peter                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423069/#Comment_423069" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T14:21:05+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  2:21PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am delighted to hear that the relationship seems mutual!<br/><br/>So I might have some answers for you, but I have to warn you, the first may sound a bit like bullshit. It's not! But it may sound like it.<br/><br/>I try to avoid using the term "failure" in the text, specifically when referring to when you roll a tie, because I want to avoid the traditional paradigm that accompanies it. Just like a traditional failure, if you roll a tie in <i>Sw/oM</i> your rogue is prevented from achieving their goal. But none of the other baggage comes along with it. It's not necessarily the rogue's fault or due to a lack of competence. It doesn't mean the rogue is forever prevented from achieving their goal. It does not have to be a "whiff."<br/><br/>Instead, think of it as an opportunity to invest glory in your opposition, like I talk about <a href="http://dig1000holes.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/the-shield-the-ring/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You are not thwarted because you're not of a high enough level to deal with the situation. You're thwarted because no one is of a high enough level to deal with the situation. This is not a moment of failure, this is a moment of fantastic difficulty or hardship.<br/><br/>To use Manyara's trick as an example, this thing you've encountered can be so weird, so unusual, so unique in the world, that even Manyara has never heard of its like. (This is one of the reasons why half the ties in the game lead to a Mystery.)<br/><br/>Okay, so that's the change the paradigm solution. That's all well and good, but sometimes you need a more practical solution. You may find that in the Heroic Feat rules on page 21 of "The City of Fire &amp; Coin." These let the Rogue Players ignore a roll they don't like, and ties certainly qualify.<br/><br/>As for incorporating prep, here's a simple way to write an adventure for <i>Swords Without Master</i>, and one that anyone, not just the Overplayer, can do. (In fact, it's actually one of the Tricks available to Rogue Players.) Take your three motif cards and pre-fill out the last element on each card. So it will look a bit like this:<br/><br/><b>Motif <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></b><br/>* __________________<br/>* __________________<br/>* An icy cavern that echoes in the voice of a child.<br/><br/><b>Motif <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></b><br/>* __________________<br/>* __________________<br/>* The slaying of a 1,000 warriors in a single night.<br/><br/><b>Motif <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a></b><br/>* __________________<br/>* __________________<br/>* Astride leather-winged mounts.<br/><br/>When it comes time to play, toss them out on the table. You play normally, but before you can move on from one motif to the next, you must have the pre-filled out element arise in play. Once it does arise, treat is as normal. You can even set up your echoes by doing things like describing "bat-winged silhouettes against the moons" while you're still on the first or second motif card.<br/><br/>There are other ways to incorporate prep, but the key to them all is to prep only part of each idea. Draw a map, but don't fill it in (<a href="http://planet-thirteen.com/DungeonMaps.aspx" rel="nofollow">For Love of Dungeons</a> is perfect for this.) And always be open with it. Put the entire map right out in front of everyone from the beginning. Let the other players write and draw on it. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>Hopefully that's a little more helpful. I mean, it's not as helpful as publishing the damn game already, but I hope it's at least a little better than scrawling all this information out longhand in a notebook and then setting that notebook on fire before anyone else had a chance to read it.<br/><br/>P.S.

Actually this understanding of "failure" was one of my guesses, so I believe I am in the know now and I feel confident and good.<br/><br/>As for the prep thing: I still see these as the trickier parts of the game but I know they'll work. It's a pity I haven't understand the mechanic fully when I read your response first--I somehow missed the part about the obligation to "pre-incorporate" so these pre-written motives seemed a bit forced and detached in play, indeed. (But hey, I nevertheless preincorporated one of them instinctually!)<br/><br/>It's not a big thing but I am eager to hear some clarifications or an example about this: I am not yet fully confident about Morals in the Discovery phase. I see the other options but what could be the <i>unintended consequence</i> of remembering, recognizing, discovering or knowing something?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423468/#Comment_423468" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T18:36:22+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  6:36PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/czipeter">@czipeter</a> With a Moral in a Discovery phase you get to re-contextualize things, perhaps your own character, perhaps the world, to your regret. Your character may realize that the mark on the temple door is the same as a tattoo on their arm that appeared one night. Or, classically, learning something may then make them the target of some person/god/monster/lover's ire. Remembering something may suddenly make the chase you've been running--for example, away from a pirate crew--suddenly make sense: that woman you stole your sword from is the captain of the ship. <br/><br/>Hope those examples help!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423485/#Comment_423485" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T03:30:26+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  3:30AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Emily, your examples not just help, they inspire! At the same time, I have to add, I was not specific enough. Where I lose my confidence is writing the thread about this Moral. While in the other phases you act, in the Discovery you don't really do anything. So a statement, a judgement on some action--a Moral--is problematic for me as I don't see any (present) action in this case. Could you please augment your examples with the lines then written down by the player? I'd love to see them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
