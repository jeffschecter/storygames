                    I've been digging up old idea-seeds that I generated with the Mix-O-Tronic on an earlier incarnation of my website and polishing them up for posting to my blog.  One of them is called <i>Clockwork Gods</i>, and it goes something like this:<br/><br/><i>The Clockwork Gods have come to Summerland. In an infinite land of eternal summer, an agrarian society has lived for eons. Now, with the coming of the Clockwork Gods, technology, and all of it's blessings and ills, has started to spread across the land. Seige engines, windmills, canals and locks. Gunpowder. With this change comes the end of the old ways, of the Worldly Spirits.<br/><br/>Not that the Worldly Spirits are taking all of this lying down. Since the appearance of the Clockwork Gods, storms have increased their power, damaging windmills. Floods have become more common, drowning canal locks. The Clockwork Gods' greatest feats, the clockwork mecha, are susceptible to lightning; their pilots are falling prey to wolves and other beasts of the forest.<br/><br/>Caught in the middle are the people of Summerland. While the coming of the Clockwork Gods means less toil for them, their connection with the land is too valuable for them to lose. In the war of ideas, there are no more casualties than in the ranks of those just trying to strike a balance between clockwork and nature.<br/><br/>Clockwork Gods players can choose to play a clockwork god, a worldly spirit, a proxy or paladin of either, or one of the temporal leaders of Summerland who are caught in the middle of this epic conflict.</i><br/> <br/>original concepts :: {gadgets . mythology . Alice in Wonderland}<br/> <br/><i>A large part of the inspiration for this game - what I see in my head when I think about it - is Princess Mononoke. Towering spirits of the forest coming to get their revenge on the evils of encroaching man. There is a twist, however, in that the encroaching humans have spiritual powers working with them. Originally, I was going to set the game in Wonderland itself, but then decided that a more history-neutral term, like Summerland was more apporpriate. After all, Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland in the Victorian Era, which is practically synonymous these days with clockwork and steampunk.<br/><br/>One of the key elements of the game is the balance the players and the story takes between Clockwork and Spirit, technology and magic. Clockwork Gods works on the presumption that the two are, if not antithetical to each other, at least non-cooperative. In the end, however, the true compromise lies in understanding that Nature and Technology can work together, even interact symbiotically. Whether or not the characters wind up exploring these themes, this is the underpinning of the rules system for Clockwork Gods.</i><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Ok, so that's the idea.  The problem, thus far, has been in trying to figure out what the upside of neutrality is.  Originally, the main character attribute was going to be a single track, with a score of Clockwork(10) at one end and Spirit(10) at the other end, with a zero point in the middle.  (I hope I'm describing it adequately.)  <br/><br/>Having a 10 in Clockwork means that you can drive a clockwork mech, forge a suit of chainmail in a day, invent and build new Rube Goldbergish devices and otherwise be a techno-fantasy badass - but if you wade across a river, you have a much greater chance of being swept away.  If there's a bear in the area, you smell like dinner - that sort of thing.  A 10 in Spirit means that you can call on animal friends <i>a la</i> Aquaman, ride out a hailstorm without being beaten to death, and bend living trees to your will.  But if someone slaps you in a pair of forged iron manacles, you're helpless.<br/><br/>The theme of the game is balance and symbiosis - so there must be an upside to having what is effectively a zero in both Clockwork and Spirit.  At first I thought it could mean that if you achieved that balance, you had an <i>effective</i> score of 10 in either.  But then if you stray to either side (and movement along the continuum would be a common thing), the drop-off in effectiveness is sudden and too steep.  I need an upside to the middle ground so that it's an effective third road to mastery on either side.<br/><br/>I also considered a third derived statistic, Temporal (meaning worldly influence in the affairs of humanity).  But I wasn't sure how to implement it in such a way that it would work well with the other two much more dramatic statistics.  It'd be derived by taking (10 - Clockwork) or (10-Spirit), whichever the character had a positive score in.  So a character with a Spirit of 1 would have a Temporal of 9.  But I don't know what that gives me in the design of the game - or what it means in terms of the game world - mainly because it says that the greatest of the temporal rulers are those without power in the realm of Clockwork or Spirit - when really I'm looking for a fusion of the two.  I suppose changing the nature of the derived statistic to something else might help - but I was looking for y'all's opinion.                </div>

<p>Well, what are the obligations of having a close tie to Spirits?  What are the obligations of having a passion for Clockwork?  How hard does a character who wants both have to work in order to find peace between the two principles?</p>
<p>I wouldn't try to balance it like points in D&amp;D are balanced.  I'd balance it like moral issues in DitV are balanced.  If someone wants to walk the razors edge, make sure that the path is sharp.  They get the power to do what they know is right ... now they just have to figure out what that is.</p>
<p>Damn, late enough at night I get downright poetical.</p>

                            I did something like this in my Ill Winds campaign.  The key here is to remember how you've defined 'Neutrality' - as a state of balance between the two poles, where neither is dominant but both can function effectively - but you're trying to make them operate on a single scale.  How about this:<br/>
<br/>
Each character has two tracks:  Spirit and Clockwork.  Losing a point of Spirit means gaining a point of Clockwork and vice versa, but both tracks start at 5.  That way, you can have 5 in each, or 10 in one or the other, or any balance in between.  When you're all about Technology or Nature, you push towards a 10; if you're in balance, you want to hang around at 5 in each.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you probably can't maintain a 5/5 balance easily, so you might want to make it easier to have your actions shift your tracks more easily the smaller the difference between the numbers.  Personally, I'd have the tracks be an odd number, so a perfect balance would never be possible.  There's a lot more potential to having people waver between 6/5 and 5/6 than there is in having people ever be able to achieve, even temporarily, pure balance.  That balance (I think) is more interesting if it has to be dynamic.                        </div>

                            I like Tony's idea.<br/><br/>Also, if the reward for going to the extremes (0 and 10) is being effective, it strikes me that you need a <i>different</i> reward for staying balanced. For example, you could give experience points (or character development points or something) based on how far the character strayed from the middle: 5 if you stayed at 5 throughout; 4 if you went to either 6 or 4; 3 if you went to either 7 or 3; and so on.<br/><br/>Also...as a very off-the-wall thought...you could use a mechanic based on how close a random number is to the attribute. For example, if you roll 1d10, then you're most effective if you roll your attribute exactly; you're very effective if you're within one of your attribute; you're quite effective if you're within 2 of your attribute; and so on, until you get to 9 away from your attribute, which is a drastic failure.<br/><br/>With that mechanic, numbers closest to the middle are the most effective. (OK, hang on, that's not quite what you want, but it's probably worth throwing out there).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
