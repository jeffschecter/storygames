I like the <i>idea</i> of flashbacks, and having recently seen how they are implemented in <i>3:16</i> has made me wonder about other potential uses.<br/><br/>Here's the original thought experiment:<br/><br/>The PCs are aged and experienced adventures, say level 30s with all the glitz and kickin' gear that implies (for convenience sake, I'll use <i>D&amp;D 4E</i> terminology, because I assume most people are at least passingly familiar). They are all on a pilgrimage of some sort together (being as they are epic-level characters, maybe it's literally the road into the afterlife/into the west/into a new universe), and they decide to pass the time by telling stories.<br/><br/>So, then, each player takes a turn setting up a piece of their character's history. They pick a level of play, and set the stage, and then the gamemaster takes over and runs an adventure. The thing is, not everyone else's character was there, so everyone else has to crank out a character at that level (let's say the first story takes place at level 1), unless two characters knew each other back then.<br/><br/>Next session, another PC gets a chance to "tell the story". For convenience's sake, they have to use the next level of play, <i>but</i>, once the stage is set for the flashback, anyone can either make a new character, or introduce one of the characters from the previous session into this one.<br/><br/>So, the starting party (the 30th levels) are A, B, C, and D.<br/><br/>Session 1: A starts telling the others a tale of his first adventure, in the Marsh of Madness. He remembers like it was yesterday. With him were E, F, and G... So the other players stat up E, F, and G, ,the narrating player makes up his own character, A, at level 1, and the Marsh of Madness is played.<br/><br/>Session 2: B says "That was an excellent story. It reminds me of the time I fought the goblin overlord in the Howling Mine. It reminds me of that because I met G right after she left the Marsh of Madness, and helped her recover from that poisoning! So it was me, G, H, and I..." B makes a version of her character at level 2, and someone levels up G. The others make  up H and I, two new level 2 characters.<br/><br/>Session 3: C's turn...<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>Eventually, you would see the various tales of the characters and their background cast grow and evolve. You could revisit places, either with the same character or different ones (at level 20, D's party at the time went to the same Marsh of Madness, which was now populated by some kind of potent aberrations, but when they cleared it out, they also founded a village there. By the level 29 adventure, A goes back to wander his old haunts, and finds that there's now a city where he went on his first adventure. Nostalgic tear).<br/><br/>Obviously I've thought about this most in terms of <i>D&amp;D</i>, because the level-based system makes it easy to think of "eras" of play, but there's no reason it wouldn't work with other games just as well (perhaps better). <i>Pendragon</i> springs to mind immediately as one example.<br/><br/>-AD                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201103/#Comment_201103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T10:21:21+00:00" title="April  7, 2009 10:21AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool.

I'm not entirely what to suggest, though, because you also want to be able to stat out characters at different levels of progression.  Risus, maybe?  Though might be too freeform.  In a Wicked Age is arguably built for something like this.  Just let the current player create one or two oracle cards, and draw the other ones.  Neither of those really supports dungeon-crawly encounters, though, when it comes to number-crunching.  Red Box Hack, maybe?  Hrm.

My FLGS is only just starting to get into the idea of selling RPGs that aren't "mainstream". They have a HUGE RPG section, but the "indie" stuff is limited to <i>Burning Wheel</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, and <i>3:16</i>, maybe a few others, and living in Canada, the shipping costs kill me when I order stuff from online, even when the exchange rate is good.<br/><br/>Can you give a quick example of the <i>IaWA </i>mechanics and how they would click with this?<br/><br/>I thought about <i>Risus</i>, but the problem is that there's no concrete "development" mechanic in that game, and I think it works better if the players can see their character mechanically developing from one stage to another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201113/#Comment_201113" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T11:05:36+00:00" title="April  7, 2009 11:05AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2009 11:53AM by MikeRiverso.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all: You can get a pdf version of IaWA online directly from Vincent.  I think it's only $10.  It's a game where you don't have to reference book much, once you learn it.  Hell, it's easier to learn by playing it, rather than by reading the book.<br/><br/>Basically, at the start of each session, you randomly draw 4 cards from a normal deck, compare them to a chart of "Oracles".   Each oracle card is essentially one sentence which provides an evocative image (te official oracles, as well as a bunch of custom generators, can be found <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=In_a_Wicked_Age" rel="nofollow">here</a>)  From these oracles, the players and GM come up with potential characters and their best interests (including their relationships to one another), as well as the situation they find themselves in.  <br/><br/>So, for your example above, one of the oracles (if you're letting the active player write one) could be something like "A dense marsh, the air thick with an hallucinogenic fog."  Then you draw a few cards from your own custom oracle and come up with a few things like "A young priest, wavering in his faith." and "A pack of cannibalistic goblins, hungry for blood."  So you take these elements and figure out the situation.  Perhaps the priest is an NPC and has hired the PCs as guides/bodyguards as he takes a journey to reaffirm his faith.  Or the priest could very well be one of the PCs.   With a mechanic like this, you don't have to spend any time prepping, and can just work on the fly.<br/><br/>The other key to IaWA that makes it work for what you want here is the Owe List.  Namely, whenever a character goes into a conflict as the underdog (lower dice than his opponent) and doesn't get thrashed outright, his name goes on the list.  At any point, characters can remove their name from the list to get a bonus die.  At the start of each session, the character on the top of the list is the one character guaranteed to be in that sessions story.<br/><br/>The dice mechanic is a little tough to explain, so I won't bother (and if I did, I'd have essentialyl told you the entirety of the game, and some sort of copyright police would be after me :P).  Suffice it to say, all rolls are contested, and you only roll when someone (GM or player) challenges your narration.  "I slit his throat!"  "No, you don't!"  *roll*  Losing a conflict means either taking a hit to your stats, or giving the winner some narrative control.<br/><br/>Note that Wicked Age isn't quite made for party-oriented games, as the games often involve players working against eachother, but with the right mindset, it can work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yasha" title="Yasha"><img alt="Yasha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/535/nC2R7IBQNACRI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yasha">Yasha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201132/#Comment_201132" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T12:37:45+00:00" title="April  7, 2009 12:37PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Tales of the Caliphate Nights True20 supplement has a Framing system in which a player spends a conviction point to allow their character to tell a story in-game.  The story can then be played out with the player narrating and the other players playing various roles in the story. There are optional quick-and-dirty diceless rules to speed resolution in these framed stories. (In Arabian Nights fashion, stories can be framed within stories within stories.)  Mechanically, the story-telling can help or hinder that character's attempt to influence an NPC.  It also gives players a way introduce new facts about the world, but there are no mechanics for determining which facts within a story are truth or fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201134/#Comment_201134" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T12:51:12+00:00" title="April  7, 2009 12:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought about this: anyone who isn't playing a character that we know survives to the end (ie A, B, C, and D in my original example) doesn't have to worry about growing attached to the character. They can play, knowing with all certainty that their death only matters inasmuch as it impacts the "narrator's" story. So in Session 1 noted above, if E dies, it might have an impact on A ("I am harrowed by it still, all these years later. E was my friend from childhood, and on that first tragic adventure, he died in my arms"), but E's player doesn't have to worry much.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Mike">@Mike</a>: I'll pick up the PDF later today!<br/><a href="/forums/profile/James">@James</a>: I dig the "story within a story" element, and I think it would work really well in a freeform system.

The only modification is that you'd have to give each character an automatic "in" during every 2nd, 3rd, or 4th session...<br/><br/>It's designed to have various characters weave in and out of various stories, and grow stronger or weaker over time.<br/><br/>You could even go with "players take turns introducing the story" instead of drawing cards from the Oracle. As long as the player gives people enough material to generate a handful of characters, you're ready to go.<br/><br/>One major difference from what you're describing is that some players would play the "main characters" and some would play "the opposition". The game doesn't make a clear line between the two, so it's quite possible that a character could be a hero in one story, a villain in the next, or, more likely, something in a shade of gray.<br/><br/>1,001 Nights, linked by wanderer, also does this, in a slightly different way. Possibly better, for your purposes.<br/><br/>You might also do a search for "Bedlam", a sort of twisted, comical version of the same kind of "story within a story" setup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201420/#Comment_201420" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T09:42:47+00:00" title="April  9, 2009  9:42AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just picked up <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, but with Passover prep and cleanup, haven't had a chance to read it yet.

It reads like something that's more episodic, and also is about characters who went on their adventures -together-. I like the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> idea that the PCs/narrators have never met before, so their stories might be entwined, but are distinct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
