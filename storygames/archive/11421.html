I wish I could have spent more time there! Hell, I wish I could move down there from up here in dreary Columbus Ohio. Have a blast! On that note, probably the last thing I would suggest is gaming when you could be outside doing beautiful things in beautiful weather. Among the things I would suggest (of which there are many, but I'll try and narrow it down):<br/><br/>1. Step outside South Beach. We stayed at 17th and Collins, which is a great starting off point for anywhere you want to go. Sit out on the beach, but don't JUST sit out on the beach. Restaurants in SOBE are expensive, and not terribly amazing, so going further inland or off the main drag are definitely worthwhile. For high end deliciousness, go to Soyka in the design district. For good affordable sushi, go to Hiro's on Washington in SoBe (south beach). For delicious breakfast, 2 places: Ice Box (fancier) David's Cafe III (dinerish, and has the best cuban coffee at one of those little outside accessible counters. GET IT). Also for authentic cheap cuban food go to La Caretta on 8th st. It's a chain. While you're there, walk around Little Havana, you'll see dominoes being played by old men, voodoo shops, and lots of delicious looking markets.<br/><br/>2. Going out! There's lots of live music in the area. Some cool places to hang out (and I prefer the more artsy alternative stuff) were Electric Pickle, News Cafe, Bardot, Vagabond. All of these are in Miami proper. If you want some trashier touristy hangouts, SoBe for sure. These can be entertaining, as well as beautiful (setting wise).<br/><br/>3. Shopping! There's some really fun stores and open artist galleries down Lincoln Rd. This is probably my favorite touristy area. There's an awesome store you won't be able to afford anything in called All Saints you should definitely check out, if only for the wall of skulls they have. Washington ave has some seedier places, some great thrift stores, and a museum of erotica (it was expensive though, I didn't actually go in. But they do have a hilarious collection of postcards just inside.) And Little Havana on 8th st has lots of fun shops as well.<br/><br/>4. Museums! I haven't gone to any of these yet (oddly, usually that's what I hit first), but the Miami Dade museum is supposed to be one of the better ones. There's some fabulous museum art in Miami in general, if you're looking to spend time inside, there's supposed to be some great collections.<br/><br/>5. Gardens! We went to the Fairchild Botanical Gardens. Lots of pretty and rare trees and flowers, including the awesomely rooted Banyon trees. Beautiful stuff. They also have an odd collection of garden sculpture from a few contemporary artists. The everglades are a bit of a drive, but there's some awesome wildlife down there as well.<br/><br/>Hope that's helpful! Have a great time down there, its so much fun, and a great community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256054/#Comment_256054" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T19:00:03+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  7:00PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Listen to what anansigirl said.
