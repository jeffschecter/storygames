I wrote <a href="http://yarukizerogames.com/2013/03/05/adventures-in-self-publishing/" rel="nofollow">a lengthy blog post</a> about the whole experience, but overall I was particularly happy with Amazon's CreateSpace, and found it better than Lulu. Even so, I'm definitely interested in other perspectives on various POD services.<br/><br/>Since Matthijs asked, here are the main bullet points for CreateSpace as I see it:<br/><br/>1. CreateSpace has an online checker and proofing tools, making it easier to spot potential problems before you pay for a proof.<br/>2. With the CS and Lulu proofs side-by-side I found they had comparable printing quality for the interior, but the colors on the cover of the CS version were out and out superior.<br/>3. Printing costs were substantially lower for CS. The proof literally cost about half as much, though the actual royalties work out to be roughly comparable.<br/>4. CreateSpace gives your customers Amazon's shipping options, which means shipping can be cheaper if not free.<br/><br/>It's been all of two days since I launched the book, but so far given a choice people are overwhelmingly choosing Amazon over Lulu as the place to order it (~10 Amazon orders versus zero on Lulu). I'm still in the process of setting up POD printing through DriveThruRPG (which does fulfillment through Lightning Source).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408361/#Comment_408361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T09:03:12+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  9:03AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's worth noting that neither CreateSpace nor Lulu do the printing themselves, as I understand it, and subcontract it out to other printers (maybe even including Lightning Source).

Things may have changed. Like US postage for one thing, and I dunno about subcontracted printers. Also, my opinions about what is good and what isn't may have changed, too. A year is a long time. Also, this is just one dude's perspective, so I will try to explain it as best I can.<br/><br/>Ease of use:<br/>1. Lulu was by far the easiest service to use. It took me like less than one hour to set up an account, load the files, order a proof, and pay for it.<br/>2. CreateSpace does have a checker and frankly it pissed me off. It gave me guff about my margins and blah blah blah and they required that it go through an approval process before they would take my order for a proof. I understand why and all that, but I just want to order the goddamn book that I made and I am more than able to see the mistakes in the physical product and fix them on my own. If I want help I'll ask for it.<br/>3. Back then I found the drivethrurpg process just too dense and complicated to even bother getting a proof. Since then I've found the pdf process at least quite easy.<br/><br/>Print Cost and Shipping Cost:<br/>I live in Canada, so shipping options are different for me. Lulu's print cost was higher than CS, but the shipping cost from CS was higher than Lulu. I'm talking about a $2-3 difference in shipping one book to Canada, I think it was. The overall cost difference (print+ship) was about 25 cents in favour of CS, which ultimately didn't sway me. Although CS being cheaper than even the cheapo paper type at lulu definitely says something. If I remember correctly American shipping was about the same between the two, but of it comes down to a decision between my fellow Americans and my fellow Canadians, well, I'm 'a side with my side of the border.<br/><br/>Product Quality (I'll take a few pics after my camera charges up):<br/>1. I have a black-and-white cover. The contrast on the CS cover was really high and there was a weird yellowish tint to it. The lulu cover looked more like the original art. Lulu's barcode on the back was smaller and more unobtrusive. The text on the CS cover was sharper and slightly better-looking.<br/>2. The blacks in the interior of the CS book were better, but the greys in the artwork were higher contrast and the dots looked all weird--perhaps a bit of that whachamacallit effect you get when layering zipatone.<br/>3. Lulu adds a final page with a small barcode on it so they know what cover to put on the book. But CS made a proof specifically, which means it has "Proof" in big letters on the last page. WTF? How 'bout you send me exactly what people are going to buy and I judge that, maybe, and not something you fucking graffittied up that I can't sell if there's no changes? It's not going to make me feel any more "professional" or some shit because ooh, I'm ordering a "proof" look at me. I'll feel professional when I cash the cheque. Also this is how you spell "cheque" properly.<br/><br/>Also I make no money from the Metamorphica, so I can't actually say anything about revenue collecting for either site. I CAN say that Lulu just changed their revenue tracking system and the new one is fucking bullshit garbage and it pisses me off. It will give you a nice Excel file but I do not remember how to use Excel and all I want to know are total sales for individual products separated into pdf and print and the auto services won't do that for me and I am very mad about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408395/#Comment_408395" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T15:37:45+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  3:37PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 for Johnstone.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408399/#Comment_408399" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T16:23:46+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  4:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got a question Ewen:\n<blockquote>3.

Their price point for printing is quite a bit higher than DriveThru but they also take a lower cut of the profit. For me this meant that my profit on a sale was pretty much the same as with DriveThru, but buying copies for myself (or for direct sales to others) was much more expensive.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408405/#Comment_408405" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T17:10:44+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  5:10PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still waiting on a proof from DTRPG to start up POD sales, but IMO the backend is functional but inelegant.

Does CS just take a bigger percentage after printing costs or something?</blockquote>\nSpecifically they take a further percentage for having it distributed through their online stores--20% for the CreateSpace store and 40% for Amazon--which for Amazon puts the royalty rate about on par with Lulu's. The lower printing cost basically helps you when it comes to ordering proofs (for me at least a CS proof with shipping costs less than a Lulu proof without shipping) or ordering extra copies to sell yourself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408406/#Comment_408406" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T17:27:24+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  5:27PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2013 5:41PM by Johnstone.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stop.<br/><br/>Hammertime.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_covers.jpg?w=534"/><br/><br/>Pictured above are my original proofs from both CreateSpace and Lulu (you may note that the batsnail logo is not on either of them, because it was added after I got these). You can see the contrast difference even with my camera's shitty resolution. While I normally default to preferring higher-contrast art, in this case the CS cover really put me off. Like a lot.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_backs.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>Above are the back covers, so you can see the different bar codes. My camera is nowhere near good enough to show you that CS has slightly better definition and that Lulu has some... I dunno what to call it... crap? dots? distortion? around the lettering.<br/><br/>On that note:\n<blockquote>The cover especially had duller colors and less contrast in the Lulu version (which is kind of a big deal when the cover design has pop dots in two shades of blue), and the interior paper is of an off-white color that I would not have chosen myself.</blockquote>\nLulu's publisher grade paper (the cheaper option) is white and requires a barcode (and only comes in 5.5x8.5 and 8.5x11). The standard paper is cream (and doesn't require a barcode). You don't get options other than that. The Metamorphica I always thought of as a white book, but really I just went with the cheaper option, while Adventures on Dungeon Planet is a Dungeon World supplement so it should be 6x9 on cream paper just like DW. Drivethrurpg gives you paper options for all sizes of book, I don't remember about CS. Also, worth noting that, unlike Ewen, I had no colour on my cover. Except for the unpleasant yellowishness on the CS cover.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_lastpage.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>And pictured above is the final page, which is inserted as extra in your book. For Lulu, they add a whole page. For Drivethrurpg, they will print whatever you want on the <i>second-last</i> page, and just reserve the last page for that barcode.<br/><br/>There are a few other negatives to keep in mind when dealing with Lulu. Here is the first one:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_spines.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>First you will notice that the CS copy is thicker (because its heavier paper) than the two Lulu books. The Lulu books however, are a different height. One of them is 1/16th of an inch taller, or about the same height as the CS book.<br/><br/>There is another height disparity, this time in the interior (of the Lulu book):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_margins.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>Half-way through the book, the margins change, by a full 1/8th of an inch. The CS book did not have this problem at all, and there was the same distance between the edge and the text throughout.<br/><br/>Unfortunately my camera is nowhere near good enough to capture the nuances of the interior art for you. I mean, it's pretty good for something I found on the ground at 4am on New Years Day when I finally decided to stumble home shitfaced from my friend's place, but that was nearly a decade ago and it just doesn't cut it in this case. So, just know this: If you like thick, deep blacks and think that Se7en is the greatest piece of cinematography ever made because of it, CreateSpace is good and Lulu's white paper is not, although the blacks in their standard (cream) paper are very nice. If you want your greyscale artwork to be made of differently-sized dots all plotted out on the same grid and not formed into weird-ass patterns that look like crap, then pick Lulu over CreateSpace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408412/#Comment_408412" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T18:22:58+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  6:22PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2013 8:54PM by Johnstone.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is another issue that has come up for me lately: BLEED.<br/><br/><del>Neither Lulu nor Drivethrurpg will give you bleed</del> on your B&amp;W interiors (ie you can't get pictures/art/black ink to go all the way to the edge of the page). (EDIT: Okay, Lulu says it WILL do bleed if you set the margins right.) Can't remember what CreateSpace says, prolly the same. Or anyway, that's what they tell you, which doesn't mean you can't give them pdfs with art that goes to the edge of the page. Since Lulu doesn't give me any guff about my margins like CS does (and I'm a grown man) I can do whatever the fuck I want. So I give them pdfs with art all the way to the edges.<br/><br/>EDIT: I checked the margin requirements for bleed on Lulu and ordered a copy with full bleed. Will post below when it arrives.<br/><br/>Anyway, you can also order copies without bleed. The results are partly negative:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_lulubadbleed.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>As you can see in my proof copy of Adventures on Dungeon Planet above, because the file is 6x9 and the book is 6x9, but the cutting isn't super-precise, the image is offset by 1/16th of an inch, which leaves that much white space. This space varies a little bit throughout the book, but 1/16th of an inch is the most egregious it gets.<br/><br/>But the results are also partly positive. Here is a picture of another page, which has luck on its side:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_lulugoodbleed.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>This page has the appearance of full bleed! Unfortunately for me and this particular proof copy, the majority of my illustrations are on the left-hand pages. This not-bleed is sort-of a problem and I guess unfortunate, but it could be worse.<br/><br/>It could be this, for example:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_lsbadbleed.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>This is a page from my backer copy of Barrowmaze II, which says it was printed by Lightning Source in Milton Keynes UK (via Drivethrurpg). While I'm happy with what I got from my contribution to the Barrowmaze II kickstarter, I'm not real happy with the quality of the printing and I wouldn't want it for any of my books. The white border is at least 1/16th of an inch and is on the top and outside of both left-hand and right-hand pages. It is worth noting that my Adventures on Dungeon Planet is 6x9 softcover and Barrowmaze II is 8.5x11 hardcover. Larger Lulu books might be set off more, smaller LS books maybe less, I dunno. However, the printing quality on Barrowmaze II is what I would call "photocopier quality" or perhaps "I'm not mad, just extremely disappointed." The blacks are not even as good as the cheaper grade paper option from Lulu.<br/><br/>You may have seen the warning that comes with all the Vampire books on Drivethrurpg:\n<blockquote>Note: The Black &amp; White print editions of this book are not full-bleed. Because of printing requirements there is a small white border around the edge of the pages.</blockquote>\nI have not actually bought any physical books from Drivethrurpg, BUT I have to assume those white borders look just like the ones in Barrowmaze II. Also I hope the paper isn't the same because it gets crinkly near the spine. In any case, if these admittedly small sample sizes are an accurate representation, you can almost fake it with Lulu and it looks really bad with Drivethrurpg/Lightning Source.<br/><br/>Hey! Just for a bit of contrast, let's take a look at Joe Mcdaldno's game Gun Thief:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/pod_kablam.jpg?w=533"/><br/><br/>This was printed by Ka-Blam, who specialize in comics. It is comic-book format, has rich deep blacks, nice white paper, and full bleed. I don't know what else they have to offer, although sometime in the near future I will tap the local comics scene for info on this area of indie publishing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408415/#Comment_408415" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T18:37:46+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  6:37PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please, Hammer, don't hurt 'em!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408440/#Comment_408440" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T00:01:00+00:00" title="March  8, 2013 12:01AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            50 points to Johnstone.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mattastic" title="mattastic"><img alt="mattastic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/ldwgS.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mattastic">mattastic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408600/#Comment_408600" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T19:46:09+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  7:46PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to note about CS proof checking, it is done by a program.<br/>If you have text boxes set up in InDesign and the text is in the correct placement but the text box goes into the margins you will get an error.

Uploading the cover I have to go through hoops like at Drivethru but there's fewer instructions.

They only do direct deposit to bank accounts in the US and a few EU countries, and even though they will pay me by "check" they want me to do a bunch of tax paperwork right off the bat before they will even give me all of my money. Yeah, sorry CS, but I think I'll wait and see if this whole deal will actually <i>make</i> any money before I start paying an accountant to manage it for me.

It turns out that Lulu also witholds from your revenue for tax purposes, and that CreateSpace is just WAY more up-front about it. Only Drivethrurpg will send you your whole revenue and not try to worry about it for you. So I suppose I still have to get an accountant sooner, rather than later.<br/><br/>[And before you suggest it, yes, I suppose I COULD just learn how to fill out the tax forms and blah blah blah. Or I COULD just write up a new Dungeon World class and sell it on Drivethrurpg for a dollar and then give that money to an accountant. You know which one you want to happen more, and so do I.]<br/><br/>Second, let's talk more about Lulu.<br/><br/>Thanks to Rafael Chandler, I learned how to ad-hoc-bundle a print+pdf sale together. You see, Lulu does not like to sell more than one thing at a time. They will not even sell a pdf with differently-sized pages, or I would have put the letter-sized character sheets in the same pdf as the trade-sized rulebook, but NOOOOO. So I gave the character sheets away for free, because I mean really, fuck it.<br/><br/>So anyway, as Rafael explained in the Print and pdf thread, you can send people a thank-you email with a link to the pdf after they buy the print version. There are a couple of problems to this:<br/><br/>1. You don't get a custom thank-you email for each product, you get one for each account. So every product you sell will send the same thank-you email. I solved this by selling the pdfs through the account that sells the Metamorphica, while selling the print version through a different account. This would become a major pain in the ass if I had a lot of products to do this with, but with one it's okay. It also lets me do what Lulu won't do for me (and I have to learn Excel to do), which is tell me sales numbers for a single product instead of just everything all at once.<br/><br/>2. It doesn't always work. Not everybody gets their email. So again, I just do what Rafael does -- I let people know they can email me and get the pdf from me directly. There hasn't been very many of these, so it's hardly a hassle, but it's a glitch that does exist.<br/><br/>Another weird thing about Lulu is that the preview image for the print version is taken from the CMYK cover image, so it looks weird, unlike the pdf preview image which is RGB and which I uploaded separately.<br/><br/>So that's some notes on how to use Lulu.<br/><br/>I should have a slightly more interesting update in about a week or so...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411650/#Comment_411650" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T07:07:10+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  7:07AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, my book arrived on Saturday and it looks very good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411667/#Comment_411667" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T09:07:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  9:07AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience with Lulu is that the sales levels are so low that it's hardly worth it.

That is, it's been pretty solid for each of them, very much like Ewen showed above, but less high-quality than the more traditional digital and offset press printing we usually do. <br/><br/>That said, I'm glad to have POD options, and since the quality across them seems about the same, I'm currently favoring DTRPG because of the administrative tools, stronger game marketing, and the monthly payments (as opposed to Lulu, where it's quarterly, I think).<br/><br/>For those reasons, we've never really pushed Lulu as a storefront. If people want <i>Grey Ranks</i> or <i>Drowning and Falling</i>, we used to link to them there, but now we're mostly pointing to DTRPG.<br/><br/>(as an example of why I'm not crazy about Lulu, you can't find our books by searching for Bully Pulpit Games, even though we've been selling there for years.

Maybe I should even feel flattered? There doesn't seem to be that much pirate-demand for other DW supplements! (10-11 days it took, but the request for it went out within the first 24 hours. Maybe my next book will be requested before it even comes out... just like a Pathfinder product!)<br/><br/>On the other hand, I AM offended by the laziness. All I had to do was shut things down for like 20 minutes and change the links around and bam, no more piracy until somebody else with 20 bucks wants to share. Normally pirates at least take the effort to upload to a file-sharing site (and then I wouldn't be able to do anything about it, too!).<br/><br/>Oh!

Check the O.R.! You love the O.R.!<br/><br/><b>Here is the story of Lulu and Drivethrurpg.</b> Why did I choose to sell through Lulu? The short answer is "fuck Lightning Source" and the long answer is...<br/><br/>So back in the first half of March I was setting things up to sell <i>Adventures on Dungeon Planet</i>. I had already bought versions from Lulu so I could proofread them, so I had that set up, it just needed to go public. But Drivethrurpg is THEE rpg storefront, so I set things up there as well.<br/><br/>Pretty quickly my cover was rejected. If you have the book and are looking at it, that's what they rejected. Try and see if you can tell what is wrong with it, go ahead. If you don't have the book, here is a picture that will show you what is wrong:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dsc00029.jpg?w=658"/><br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Did you get it? The answer is: the text on the spine goes all the way to the edge of the spine area! Their instructions are to leave 1/16th of an inch space between the text and the edge of the spine area, to account for a printing variance of 1/16th of an inch. Or that's what they said. But we'll get back to that.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I emailed Drivethrurpg about this and talked to the guy there and he went over to LS to talk about it. This was a slow process. A week later, all he's done is confirm why they rejected the cover and said he can't do anything about it. But there's another problem they didn't bother to tell me about before: LS didn't even get the interior file. The DTRpg guys checks for me and confirms I uploaded it properly and they sent it to LS. So, not exactly off to a great start.<br/><br/>At this point I lost my temper a bit, because the entire process from uploading files to ordering and paying for a copy at Lulu takes 20 minutes tops and here I am with bupkis after a full week. Then I calmed down, modified the text on the cover, and resubmitted everything to DTRpg.<br/><br/>A week and a half later I still had no response, and the month was almost over so I started selling the book through Lulu. Two and a half weeks later (or one week after I started selling it) it was approved by LS. So I ordered myself a copy. Another two and a half weeks later (AKA yesterday) it arrived. There is literally only one thing better about it compared to Lulu: it costs less to print.<br/><br/>Okay, first let's back up. What does the spine look like? I don't like it. Here it is:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dsc00032.jpg"/><br/><br/>Apparently they don't have a problem with the placement of the black bar that covers the entire spine, it's just the placement of TEXT that is a problem. Now, okay, there is a perfectly good reason for this requirement: most books have a spine that is the same colour as the cover and text that doesn't touch the edges. If some dufus puts their text in the wrong place, customers will think it is a misprint and return it. So, institute a rule. That is fine, but I already printed my cover, it is awesome, and so I know it works, even though it is highly unusual. In fact, if I look at my bookshelf, there is only one book with text that covers the entire spine, and it looks like absolute dogshi--<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v518/malcolmcraig/games/hw_cover.jpg"/><br/><br/>Oh. Well, no. It looks absolutely fucking amazing, actually. I guess me and <del>Malcolm Craig</del> graphic designer Paul Bourne are just from some alien planet of weird book design or something. It's a bit odd though that they will let me fuck up one part of my cover but not another.<br/><br/>It could also be that I misunderstood what that 1/16th variance is supposed to mean, however. Because if we look at the back of <i>Adventures on Dungeon Planet</i>, we can see that the spine bleeds over onto the back cover by... about 1/16th of an inch.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://redboxvancouver.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dsc00033.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's hard to see in that picture because my camera is crappo, but the black bar that is supposed to cover the spine and only the spine does indeed wrap around onto the back cover for about 1/16th of an inch. Which means that the cover measurement LS gave me was wrong. Wait, what? Is that right? Yes, that black bar that covers the spine is exactly the same size as the measurement they gave me for the spine of my book and it was wrong. So, does this mean that I can have the text touching the edge of the spine next to the front cover and I just have to pretend that the edge touching the back cover is 1/16th of an inch to the right? I don't even know!<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Okay, so that's a bit of a problem. There are a few others, too:<br/><br/><b>First</b>, I ordered cream pages. I got white pages. Maybe "cream" means something different for them? I dunno. Why is the option there in the list if you can't pick it?<br/><br/><b>Second</b>, no bleed. This wouldn't be a big deal if I was making a book that didn't have bleed, and it wouldn't be AS big a deal if their competitors also didn't offer full bleed, but I am and they do so it is.<br/><br/><b>Third</b>, the inking is rather poor quality. It looks like they attempted to use the same deep, rich black ink as Lulu does but it somehow doesn't stick to the paper as well and looks washed out. Kind of gives it a "bad photocopy" look.<br/><br/><b>Fourth</b>, I don't really like having a bar code on the back, but that's just a personal thing. The actual cover is just as good as the Lulu cover.<br/><br/><b>Fifth</b>, did I mention how long it takes? With Lulu, 20 minutes to go from pdf on my computer to book that is paid for, plus a week in the mail. With LS it's two and a half weeks for one, two and a half weeks for the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412780/#Comment_412780" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T10:05:23+00:00" title="April 26, 2013 10:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2013 8:54PM by Johnstone.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the bright spots, or the other side of things:<br/><br/>It's not an automatic slam dunk on all counts for Lulu, however. It is definitely cheaper to use Lightning Source, by a couple dollars, which could either go to increasing profit margins or reducing the cost of a book. They also have a different selection of options, and Drivethrurpg is, as I noted before, THEE rpg storefront.<br/><br/>So, for example, I've been thinking of doing a revised version of <i>The Metamorphica</i> at some point in the future, when I have enough extra material to make that feasible. And I've been thinking about it being 6x9 trade size instead of half letter size, to match my Dungeon World books. But this book has to have white pages, which Lulu doesn't do for 6x9 books. Since it doesn't have a lot of art, the inferior quality of LS's printing wouldn't really be much of an issue. Plus it would be easier to sell pdf and print together on Drivethrurpg (sorry guys, I'm not going to do a <i>free</i> revised version).<br/><br/>LS also doesn't do staple-bound books, and I want to make some stapled 6x9 adventure modules for Dungeon World. So that has to be through Lulu. Since these are adventures, not rulebooks, I feel like I can sell print and pdf separately, as long as the print is at a fairly reduced price. Which would mean I could sell pdf through DTRpg and print through Lulu. And hopefully customers who want both wouldn't be too upset.<br/><br/>I still have to get the first one finished, though, but those are some thoughts on actually putting this comparison to use. I just hope everything so far in this thread has been either useful, enlightening, or entertaining.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds" title="nerdwerds"><img alt="nerdwerds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/515/nJ7S2QOLDAAGX.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerdwerds">nerdwerds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412829/#Comment_412829" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T20:42:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  8:42PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very enlightening.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413696/#Comment_413696" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-07T18:08:12+00:00" title="May  7, 2013  6:08PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another problem with Lulu is that they won't let you sell more than one product per individual sale. This is solved by putting a link in the thank you note they email to customers. Which itself has two problems:<br/><br/>1) Only one thank you note per account, not one per product. Every product sold from a particular account receives the same thank you note email. I have been told this is a pretty simple thing to solve and that some dumbass at Lulu just put the widget at the wrong level in the storefront code but I can't say for sure.<br/><br/>2) It has not been working for my book for a few days now. I've contacted Lulu about the problem, but right now customers are not receiving thank you note emails. Ugh, Lulu, you make such nice books, why can't you get the rest of your shit together?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413697/#Comment_413697" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-07T18:18:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2013  6:18PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently released <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/ribbon-drive/" rel="nofollow">Ribbon Drive</a>, and ordered proofs through two sources: Lightning Source (DriveThruRPG's POD affiliate) and MagCloud.<br/><br/>In the end, I went with MagCloud, though the quality on both was impressive. It's a full-colour book. The backgrounds printed via MagCloud look a little grainy, but overall pretty good. The cover looks gorgeous. The MagCloud version lays much flatter than the Lightning Source one, and generally felt "less POD."<br/><br/>MagCloud is expensive per-page ($0.16 per colour magazine page), but with a small enough page-count it starts to make sense. Ribbon Drive is a lean 24 pages including front/back inside/outside cover.<br/><br/>My camera isn't great - maybe someone else can take more photos of their copy?<br/><br/><img alt="image"

version of SFBK I used a British pod firm called BookprintingUK; although they now seem to be called something else, and have a different name for the billing, and a guy brought in to revamp the operation- who was full of enthusiasm when I spoke to him a few months ago- is now no longer working there, none of which has the effect of inspiring confidence. Nevertheless, the quality is fine-a wee bit on the flimsy side but I've since found out that I could have paid slightly more for a harder cover and stiffer inside pages. The insides are b/w and there are 54 pages- not sure of the weight but it feels pretty light- and the cost per copy was \xa31.80 (about $2.80 US), which seemed very reasonable, plus the MOQ was only 20 copies. <br/><br/>Eventually I'll probably go for lulu because of the distribution, ISBNs and cross-pollination with Amazon etc., as someone has mentioned above, but I don't see why you can't have files on multiple platforms- I hear that as RPGNow uses Lightning Source their quality is excellent, and I just had an e-mail from Matt saying that the percentage is 30% for exclusive, and 35% for non-exclusive, which again seems pretty fair. <br/><br/>P.S. Joe, Is...is...is that the hand that wrote Monsterhearts? And Ribbon Drive, and Perfect (Unrevised), and, and, The Quiet Year?

Maybe it was just a rough patch there, since some people have got them since then. So maybe it just takes a really long time and some people are impatient, or it gets caught in their spam filters and they never see it, and maybe sometimes it just never goes out. Or Lulu sends it to an email the customer doesn't use anymore so they have to hit me up direct. All of which is fair enough, of course. I want a pdf right away too.

Once or twice a year Lulu hand out a bunch of discount codes and you start to see threads on all the rpg sites asking which RPGs are available to use it on. Positioning yourself so you can plug your game in those threads is smart IMO. It worked for me, I sold a few extra copies of Other Worlds to people I wouldn't have reached otherwise.

I played Squadron UK, the Brit supers game by Simon Burley, at a con a couple of months ago. It's produced by Lightning Source, and my feeling was that it was a bit flat, but that could be because, as you suggest, it was standard, not premium, colour, or the stock or something. <br/><br/>Btw I just want to re-iterate that even though lulu has been getting a bad rap on this forum, I think the distribution channels, links to Amazon and ISBN make it worth doing, plus I don't think there's any reason why you shouldn't have a product listed on multiple sites.

Seriously low sales, and the last time I looked into distribution options they cost money up front, which I wasn't interested in. In addition, some standard shipping addresses come up as "undeliverable" in their system, and I've never had a particularly useful customer service experience with them. One technical question, about why a cover thumbnail doesn't render correctly on their website even though it prints just fine, has gone unanswered for years.<br/><br/>Lulu is, however, extremely easy to use and pretty predictable about what you're gonna get out of it.<br/><br/>I've found their prices, per unit, hilariously high when compared to doing a short digital print run through a digital printer that specializes in such things. This is, of course, moving away from true-print-on-demand and into printing books and having stock, which is another conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416493/#Comment_416493" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T13:05:20+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  1:05PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I tried another experiment.<br/><br/>Being unhappy with the B&amp;W product produced by Lightning Source (via DTRPG), I tried using their Standard Colour option. You get bleed with this one and it is still cheaper than Lulu's B&amp;W per-unit cost. Unfortunately I have to say I am not at all satisfied with this option either. The bleed is fine, but the ink is, if anything, worse than the B&amp;W version (which in turn is worse than Lulu's ink). Plus, they rejected my text on the spine twice even after I made it smaller and smaller and it fit into the space guidelines they asked for (or so it seemed to me, anyway) that I ended up leaving the spine blank. It was smaller than the text on the spine of the B&amp;W version, and yet they seem to be the same size. So who knows.<br/><br/>But it's pretty obvious that if I want to sell print books through DTRPG, they're going to have to be text-heavy or premium full-colour.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416498/#Comment_416498" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T13:52:41+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  1:52PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah jeez, just when I'd more or less decided to go with RPGNow; I've already entered into a conversation with them about prices etc. What about CreateSpace, anybody used them?<br/><br/>And...\n<blockquote>My understanding is that an ISBN you get through Lulu (or CreateSpace) technically lists lulu (or CS, etc) as the publisher.

I moved the Metamorphica over to DTRPG on the 18th of last month and only today did I get my print copy. It might be because they send me books from the UK instead of the US, but the approval process also takes a long time.<br/><br/>But! I got my copy, so: comparison time!<br/><br/>The Lulu version is publisher grade white paper, 5.5 x 8.5 inches, black and white (full bleed available).<br/>The DriveThruRPG (Lightning Source) is white paper, 5.5 x 8.5 inches, black and white (full bleed not available).<br/><br/>Since the Metamorphica doesn't make use of bleed, the differences are negligible. Like really, really small differences in the actual printing and alignment and the bar code on the back. Tiny. And Lightning Source is much cheaper. Which isn't a big deal for this book, since profit is by donation, but clearly marks DTRPG as superior in this particular cage match.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418828/#Comment_418828" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T15:47:55+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  3:47PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, here is something I did not expect!<br/><br/>I switched Adventures on Dungeon Planet to DriveThruRPG today.

I'm preparing to have one of my games listed on DriveTHRU atm and I was wondering the same thing. In fact, in all my exchanges with first of all Matt McElroy then Scott Holden from onebookself they've been extremely helpful, explaining to me patiently all the options <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>.   <br/><br/>I have a query however: as the difference between exclusive and non-exclusive is only 5%, isn't it sensible to go for non-exclusive and list the game elsewhere too, in order to maximise sales? (I realise this was partly spoken to upthread but I can't find the bit where it was mentioned, so apologies if folks end up having to repeat themselves).<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418965/#Comment_418965" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-24T14:54:06+00:00" title="July 24, 2013  2:54PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on what your other vendors are. If they will generate NEW sales in excess of the lost 5% margin, then yes, you should list them elsewhere. If you are like me and your current other option is just Lulu, then almost anybody who would buy the pdf from Lulu will buy it from DTRPG. If you're selling through IPR and the majority of your business is offset print hardcopies (bundled with pdf), a non-exclusive pdf-only deal with DTRPG is probably all icing, basically.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that it's only the pdfs that are exclusive. You can still sell print versions through other channels, and you can still sell your pdf directly from yourself (or give it away). But that 5% difference also applies to the print version you sell through DTRPG. And I think the print version is the one that people have more of an issue with. Australians do NOT want to order your book from Lightning Source, for example. So those new pdf sales have to cover 5% of pdf AND print sales from DTRPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422335/#Comment_422335" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T16:55:50+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  4:55PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've trashed Lightning Source a lot in this thread, so I should give them some kudos when it's deserved.<br/><br/>Recently, I was looking at Jackson Tegu's copy of Itras By, because I've heard about it a bunch and was curious. It's hardcover, standard colour from DriveThru, and it looks really, really nice. There's not a whole <i>lot</i> of colour, since it's B&amp;W line art with colour highlights, and the black ink isn't quite a thick, dark, and glossy as Lulu's, but it still looks really nice. I don't know the exact specs, obviously, but according to the stuff I know, it's cheaper to print this version than a normal B&amp;W version from Lulu, and actually looks better (even if it's because of the colour elements).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422344/#Comment_422344" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-02T20:17:50+00:00" title="October  2, 2013  8:17PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here I am thinking about why LS and Lulu's blacks are different.
