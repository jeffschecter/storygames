<div class="Message">
                    So for almost four years I've played in this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Werewolf: the Apocalypse</span> LARP. It runs every other weekend, with about 25 to 30 players, 2 co-GMs and one head GM. I'm the paperwork guy (lovingly referred to as "Desk Nazi"). It ostensibly uses Rock-Paper-Scissors Mind's Eye Theatre rules for task resolution, but there's lots of fiat.<br/><br/>Last weekend the GMs improvised a major plot event: in response to a perceived insult, all the werewolves' spirit allies stage a walk-out. This would have sweeping effects in the fiction, as many characters maintain intimate relationships with their particular allies.<br/><br/>As this event unfolded in the fiction, the players did their best to react appropriately, but there was a haze of disconnection in the air. "How is this <i>possible</i>?" was the tenor of it. It went profoundly against many players' understanding of the fictional spirit world. The "insult" that triggered the betrayal didn't seem to justify the magnitude of it. There was also a scene in which a GM played a beloved NPC against type, engendering more bewilderment.<br/><br/>This week the GMs are drawing major fallout. A third of the players have filed a complaint with the Player Representative, who's a go-to guy for channeling concerns to the GMs. The word "redline" (i.e., retcon) has been bandied about, which is something I've rarely heard amongst a group as play-it-as-it-lies as this.<br/><br/>It is a classic illustration of the fundamental act of roleplaying: you need to agree on what's happening in the fiction. The GM and many of the players are having a disagreement, and now we're working on resolving it at the Social Contract level. (It's complicated when thirty people are involved!)<br/><br/>Curiously, I did not suffer the disconnect as strongly as the other players. When wacky things happen in LARP fiction, I've learned to be flexible -- kind of like an Improv actor whose partner throws a curveball he doesn't dig. Better to run with it than to block, is my usual attitude.<br/><br/>But when I think about it, I can think of curveballs I <i>would</i> call foul on. If the GMs had told me, "Hey, this guy from your backstory appears, takes away your ancestral curse and disappears," I'd be all, "full stop!" It just so happens that this spirit-world walk-out didn't affect me that way, whereas others feel differently.<br/><br/>So I guess I came here wondering -- how do we identify such things up-front? With a "Lines Not To Cross" box on the character sheet? <i>Can</i> we even identify these things ahead of time? I think so many players were stunned in part because they wouldn't have dreamed of the GMs doing this.<br/><br/>I feel like there's tension between the Lines and the GM's role to threaten things we care about. In theory, this could have been a masterstroke for the GMs, since all the characters in the game care about the spirit world; but as it happens, the GMs went too far too fast. I'm trying to see what mistakes happened -- if any at all, or instead it's just normal human misinterpretation.                </div>

Now, does this remind me of more than several occasions of Vampire LARP or what? (I'm picking out Vampire, because it's the longest running campaign I've been involved in and thus had most of these unfortunate events)<br/><br/>The way I cope with such situations is usually plain ignore. If it doesen't make sense, I kind of tune the whole thing down and concentrate on something else. It's not a terribly good method, but better thank spending the whole game not being in the character.

I don't have any easy solutions, just some basic larpwright 101 things that could help with it.<br/><br/>- Setting material should be something that can only be interpreted in (roughly) one way and that GM's and players are playing the same game. Werewolf is bad at this, with loads of setting books with different tone and emphasis.<br/>- Huge changes in setting, like this one, should be prepared. Either hinted at for some time (like slowly building up the situtation - spirits are tense, then hostile, then just go away) or the setting should be communicated in a way that prepares players for this kind of stuff (as a bad example, like telling players beforehand that Big Things Have Been Known To Happen Around Here). Or just tell them, straight up, that things in this game are Big and Change on moments notice.<br/>- Preparation, preparation, preparation. Larps can't be run in the same way that tabletop games can be, because it lacks the communication tools available in latter. Changing the setting in tabletop is easier because a) either the GM has the power to do that and means to communicate that (and the change the perception of setting for a handfull of players), b) things can be negotiated between the players, or GM and the players. Also, players can react with more ease, since the setting can be in constant state of change. Not so in a LARP - if you change something big in, say, game session pre-briefing, the change just drops into there and is there for the duration of the game. Communicating such a big change in setting for 30 players is considerably more difficult (providing that GM's even want to communicate such stuff to players during the game).                        </div>

I have done the very same in times past. I'm not surprised to know this phenomenon is shared.<br/><br/>In this case, I mentally sequestered the events from the rest of the setting as I knew it. My character has filed this episode away in the box labeled "1001 Reasons I Don't Understand the Spirit World"... even though my character's skills rate him amongst the most knowledgeable about the subject in the game. <br/><br/>It seems <i>that</i> reaction is the one the GMs wanted -- they didn't intend the event to be a fundamental betrayal, they wanted to "stir things up." Other players, however, are still reeling: and I'm trying to understand what the difference is between them and me. Right now my leading theory is that we were differently invested in the thing the GMs attacked.

Huh. When I came to this LARP community (former OWbN / Minneapolis, MN) from my previous LARP burg (Camarilla / Rochester, NY) I definitely needed to learn that these guys didn't interpret the setting books the same way we had out East. It still causes me some friction, just because I remember how I preferred to interpret canon, but I've learned to adapt here...<br/><br/>...and perhaps there's the gold. I have never been under the impression that the GMs and I are on the same page in regard to setting; I fought a while, but I adapted. But I'll bet many other players really thought they and the GMs really had a mutual understanding of How Things Worked. And this incident ran along a fault line.<br/><br/>Thanks for the helpful insight!

Also true. The other players have said as much: their reaction would not be so negative if this had been better foreshadowed, instead of improvised.<br/><br/>That's challenging, because I want to write a LARP where the GM doesn't have to prep much. A new GM rule? "Change the setting incrementally?"

This plot twist happened at a large formal gathering, so all the players were there to learn about the spiritual whiplash. No prep needed; the GMs had the presence and the power. It would certainly have been even more messy were the players dispersed through the building at the time.                        </div>

I suspect - though I don't know - that one of the problems could be that players have formed their own vision of how the setting works, and GM's have a different vision. If you base your play on some understanding of the setting that you consider to be fundamental and then that understanding suddenly goes haywire without proper explanation or preparation, you get yourself booted out of the experience of being in a consistent imaginary world with a speed of light. Things just don't make sense any more and you get this ugly feeling that you're playing a game where someone cheated or fucked up just because they had power to do so. Which might not necessarily be so, but there you go, it has already ruined the experience.<br/><br/>Doing drastic changes to the gameworld is a powerful tool, just a very difficult one to use in LARP's. Campaign LARP's are like dancing on a thin ice from the GM's perspective because pretty much the only time you can (and should) use your power to change things (ranging from starting small plots to huge changes like these) is between the games, and even then you're operating with limited amount of information since it's pretty much impossible to know what the players did in the game and especially how they are interpreting the setting. You do a change that goes against players vision (which could be different from player to player) and end up wrecking things.

Ayup. Saying "we're playing MET werewolf" is like stating that you're playing in a modern world setting but not specifying if it's North Korea or North America. This is probably one of the reasons why the LARP culture around here has evolved towards what it is: larpwright's meticuosly prepare everything, from setting material to characters, keep control of everything until the game starts - after which players have control over pretty much everything. It's one way to keep the vision and setting consistent and to make sure that everyone's investing to the same game. Incidentally, same goes for a lot of tabletop playing.<br/><br/>There are probably plenty of other ways to achieve the same thing or what ever goals the GM's and players (should) have set for the game. It's just a bit of pain in the ass to stumble through the jungle of mis-communicating until the correct methods have been found.

That, there, is the Philosopher's Stone of LARP. If you happen to find it, I'll come and steal it from you. If I'd want to run a one-day LARP for, say, twenty people, the preparation time would be at least a month (provided I could spend my evenings writing and designing the game and wouldn't have to spend much time looking for the venue and doing other arrangements).                        </div>

And this case was surprising in some ways because my group has been playing together for <i>years</i>. That's a pretty good basis upon which to assume we have a mutual understanding! But on this point, we didn't.

I'd rather you pay $20 + $3 shipping and handling. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But the system I'm working on is geared toward fairly casual, long-term play with players designing their own characters; one-shot play is an entirely different animal.                        </div>

                            Hi Adam,<br/><br/>It's interesting to note, isn't it, that this problem seems peculiar to White Wolf? Nobody stops a game of Dungeons and Dragons to say "But that wouldn't happen! Orcs only attack when provoked!". No-one stopped my Meat Loaf game to say "Actually, in Meat Loaf canon, ghosts can't interact with the material world".<br/><br/>So, I think that: it's a specifically White Wolf problem; it's a product of giving people large books of setting to read; it makes it almost impossible to tell stories, because "canon" is so strict; and I think it's <i>crazy</i>. <br/><br/>But I agree it's a social contract problem. The GMs and players had different understandings of what the GM's role was. If I had my way then, when a player joined the game, they would be told:<br/><br/>1. How strictly the GMs were sticking to the setting. So either:<br/>a. "We like to stick very strictly to canon" or<br/>b. "We mess about with 'canon' for the sake of the story"<br/><br/>2. Whether the game was player-led or GM-led. Either:<br/>a. "The GMs hardly bring plot element in at all"<br/>b. "The GMs bring in plot elements, but only to react to the players."<br/>c. "The GMs bring in plot elements, which you can ignore or go along with."<br/>d. "When the GMs bring in a plot element, you're expected to stop what you're doing and deal with it."<br/><br/>...and so on, covering player character death, how combat orientated the game was, etc, etc.<br/><br/>So, yes, I think it's a social contract problem and, because the GMs and players weren't clear what the GM was allowed to do, it all went wrong. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

I too have only seen this in a White Wolf context -- but then, White Wolf is probably the only thing out there right now that combines large books of setting with a LARP system. Do you think that no such thing would happen in, say, a Forgotten Realms LARP? ("That isn't how a Red Wizard of Thay would behave...!")
<blockquote><br/>1. How strictly the GMs were sticking to the setting. So either:<br/>a. "We like to stick very strictly to canon" or<br/>b. "We mess about with 'canon' for the sake of the story"<br/></blockquote>
This warning, I think, would have been ineffective to prevent the issue: the GMs believed they <i>were</i> sticking to canon. They thought this event was well within the realm of possibilities for how a fully-functional spirit world might act. Unfortunately, it turns out that many of the players disagreed.<br/><br/>So in that sense, I'm not sure this was avoidable.                        </div>

                            Yeah...you're right. People interpret "canon" in different ways. <br/><br/>But it seems like there's some point that the GMs should have made. Something which isn't as definite as "This is what we're going to do" but  "This is the kind of thing we'll do". Don't you think? Something along the lines of: "We're not going to give you an easy ride. And all the setting stuff? We're going to <i>use it against you</i>.". <br/><br/>It's hard to explain what I'm saying, really, because I don't know the setting. But it's like I was running an MET Vampire game, and an Archon came to town, and I said to the players "OK, we're not playing this like an after dinner speech. This guy's an Archon and he'll kill anyone who gets in his way". Either way would be a good interpretation of canon, in its way.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'd say that World of Darkness canon is anything but strict; there's plenty of setting material available that covers different kind of themes, power levels, and a lot of stuff happily contradicts itself. Furthermore, both the different games published for World of Darkness interpret the "canon" and single games themselves tend to provide different flavours of setting. It's one mess of a setting material, where the larpwright has to interpret and be able to communicate his canon of choice to the players. The WoD setting material can, at it's best, only act as inspiration and a mix-bag from where you can pick the details you want and then form your own setting.  Otherwise, you're almost bound to run into problems as players interpret the "canon" in ways they are familiar and want to interpret it.<br/><br/>The new World Of Darkness seems to behave a bit better with this, since it practically forces you to create your own setting or at least provides a number of sub-settings that are more consistent. And while the WOD is probably worst example (in terms of workload for preparing a game) of the settings, it's quite an universal problem, unless the game is based on something which has a very strong theme that also controls the setting (Meat Loaf setting is an excellent example of this), or the setting is narrow enough and players are able to interpret it on same way, for example.<br/><br/>The GM-active/reactive and player-active/reactive -questions are, in a sense, a whole different matter. Without a solid setting as the base of the game, there are still plenty of changes for both players and GM's to go in very different directions, regardless of who's active and reactive. Social contracts are good for controlling this, but a bit limited with the setting.<br/><br/>LARP's where the GM's have tools to influence the play and setting during the play, tend to get easier time with this, I suspect.                        </div>
