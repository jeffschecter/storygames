The aim is to play such trailblazers; exploring, solving mysteries, righting wrongs - all the staples of riproaring adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of the game for me, Graham, would have to the simplicity of the mechanic (although I have a big soft spot for the setting). The game mechanic is the thing guarenteed to turn me off a game if its too complex or trying to be arty for the sake of it. I'd have to politely disagree with Luke about it just being an exercise in adding squishy modifiers; that certainly isn't the intention. The mechanic was designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible so that it was fast, easy to apply and didn't get in the way of the story. It was also designed to make the players think hard and describe how their skills worked, rather than falling into lazy gaming. <br/>\n<br/>\nGregor Hutton has come up with a very nice little acronym for the name - C2S2, which really should be a Star Wars droid! The name is intended to be evocative of the feel of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, Johnstone, I'd like this to be an open discussion; people frequently raise really useful points in concert far more than in isolation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Given the goal above I don't really see this in your game.  I see a lot of text telling you to do this but I don't actually see any game activity that help focus the game on this activity?   What the players doing?  What is the job of the GM?  What makes this game fun to play?<br/><br/>I'm not talking about lots and lots of crunchy rules.  I know lots of games with equally as many "rules" but those rules all hang together in a creative cycle that pushes play in the direction the game is intended to go.<br/><br/>Consider FATE.  In FATE I have Aspects.  I earn Fate points when I let those Aspects lead me into trouble.  I can then use those same Fate points to get out that trouble.  The cycle is what makes the game fun.<br/><br/>What I'm talking about doesn't have to be mechanical either.  It can be purely structural.  For example, Dirty Secrets is a game about exploring the underbelly of society.  So at the beginning of theres a procedure for setting up a tense social situation that's been victimized by a crime.  Then the procedures of the game help you deepen and expand that social situation.  The core of the game is basically a partially randomized voting mechanic that lets you decide who in this steam pot is the guilty party.<br/><br/>Basically, what's the payoff in your game?  What as a player am I creatively striving for?  When do I know I've played successfully (not the same as "winning")?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256175/#Comment_256175" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T12:38:19+00:00" title="February 11, 2010 12:38PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2010 12:38PM by J_Walton.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Lynne,<br/><br/>To offer some context for all this (which you may already be aware of, I don't know; I don't remember seeing you post before).  Story Games is weighted towards -- but not entirely composed of -- folks who are interested in relatively focused game designs whose mechanics drive towards specific themes, rather than more general, freewheeling systems that get out of the way and let the players decide what the game is about.  If you're interested in making your game more focused, you're going to get a lot of useful advice here and some potentially less useful sarcastic comments (look, you already have some of both!).  If you're happy with the design direction you've already chosen for you game, which it sounds like you are, a lot of this stuff may be less helpful.<br/><br/>To follow up on Graham's (and Brett's) comments, can you tell us about the parts of the game you are less satisfied with or the aspects that aren't working as well as you like (ideally, in play)?  That would help me have a better sense of how to be of help.<br/><br/>Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256176/#Comment_256176" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T12:46:45+00:00" title="February 11, 2010 12:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>Story Games is weighted towards -- but not entirely composed of -- folks who are interested in relatively focused game designs whose mechanics drive towards specific themes, rather than more general, freewheeling systems that get out of the way and let the players decide what the game is about.</blockquote>\nAs a point of clarification I really wish people would stop using "theme" this way.  D&amp;D has the structure I was talking about.  I construct a character with various abilities.  I pit that character against various challenges which earns him resources that open up more abilities to take on more complex challenges.<br/><br/>No "theme" in there.

Well, I can think of how to use it there. In fact, I can think of a way to use my descriptor on ANY roll at ANY time to get the full bonus. And your system is not getting out of the way.

And it is. However, it leaves some parts of it a bit counter-intuitive, specifically how the bonuses and target numbers are worded.<br><br>Having to beat the target number, and not match or beat, feels very weird. When the GM gives me a number, I first think that is the number I need. That or less, or that or more. So if the GM says "4" and I roll a 4, I feel like I should succeed. Certainly most RPGs and wargames work that way, or they have ties in the fiction when the dice are tied.<br/><br/>It also seems strange to get a +1 for any normal action. Usually, baseline items like this are ranked at 0, which tells you there is neither advantage nor disadvantage. I would think my special skills would give me bonuses, anything "normal" would be ranked 0, and anything requiring technical skills I would have a penalty for, instead of a 0.<br/><br/>Without changing the actual mechanics, just the wording, I would suggest using "match or beat" Target Numbers (use the same chart, increase all the numbers by 1), and change the bonuses you get: +2 for best skill, +1 for other skills, 0 for anything you don't have that is normal, and -1 for specialized skills you don't have.<br/><br/>Now, sure, I realize you want to have a +3 because wounds subtract from your skills. Except the first time I read that I kinda wondered if I would have to erase stuff, or something. Since the penalty applies to all skills, you could instead have a Wound track with three boxes in it. Each box checked off gives you a -1 penalty to a die roll, and if you check off all 3 boxes, you're out.<br/><br/>(As an aside, the penalty to abilities works in PDQ because you choose where to apply the penalty, instead of wounds being a penalty to all abilities. As a universal penalty, it usually works better to record it in one place and then apply it to all rolls.)<br/><br/>Of course, this is a matter of personal taste, since my suggestion above doesn't change the actual mechanics at all. I'm just going off my observations of gamers here.<br/><br/>On perhaps a more important note, at the end you also mention you had somebody else design the mechanics, because that's not one of your strengths. Now, this is a really simple resolution system, and if even that much is giving you trouble, you may want to consider concentrating on the setting instead, and creating a system-less document, which would allow players to choose whatever they happen to like, but still use Empire of Steam material you are creating. I'm thinking specifically of <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/deluge/8290918" rel="nofollow">Deluge</a>, which <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/halfjack/?p=381" rel="nofollow">Brad Murray</a> published just recently. Lacking a system certainly isn't something to be ashamed of. I'm pretty certain there are a lot of people out there who would be happy to pick up a steampunk book just as a resource, and not for the rules in it. You could also publish a suggested rule set as a supplementary document, in case people do want it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256227/#Comment_256227" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T17:22:06+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  5:22PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding characters, I agree with Luke that three vaguely-defined skills is rather boring, and having one of them be better doesn't actually make my character more effective in that area, if I write a narrowly-usable ability. John Wick had a problem with application of aspects when he was designing Houses of the Blooded, and opted for strict definitions of when they were applicable. Over the Edge has player-defined abilities, but they are usually professions or distinct abilities, though there's obviously still room for weaseling an ability into every situation. You might think an admonition to the GM to be reasonable would be enough, but clearly it's not for Luke. Keep in mind, though, that Luke is a raging monster of a GM whose cold, black heart desires nothing more than to see players fail all their rolls all the time and suffer excruciating misery and doom.<br/><br/>Myself, I think having only three details to a character pretty boring. At least give me one skill in each category, and then one extra skill at a higher rating. Reactions from other players may vary, but there's your data point.<br/><br/>Also, let's consider the actual skills you've described in the game. You mention Spirit of the Century at one point, and this is where it really shows. Your skills are very reminiscent of Aspects: "Not as Dumb as He Looks," "Amazing Strength!," "Crowd Pleaser," and "Sneaky Blighter" are not skills. Skills are verbs. These are descriptors applied to a character, aka adjectives.<br/><br/>In Spirit of the Century, you have Aspects, Skills, and Stunts. Skills function as verbs, or how your character actually does something (also what your character does). Stunts allow you to break the rules in little ways. Aspects give you a mechanical bonus for adding colour to your narration. They don't actually function as skills or abilities, they don't give you additional powers, and they don't let you deviate from the same rules everybody uses. And since you can apply them any way you want, there is th Fate point economy to keep them under control. Meanwhile, a set skill list means everybody has the same idea about what expertise in a certain skill actually means.<br/><br/>I get the idea you want a character sheet that is simple, and allows the player's imagination free reign, yeah? Do you have other specific objectives for the character sheet?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256234/#Comment_256234" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T19:52:10+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  7:52PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Lynne,<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing your game, here.<br/><br/>You mention you're looking for feedback.

But I am also wise enough to know that to each his own and the difference between being abrupt and being rude ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of feedback, comments on the mechanics are particularly what I'm after; I'm happy with the setting. But I would also like comments on the wording; as many of you will understand, when you write something, you know what you think you've said and included when frequently you haven't. Some of you have already spotted areas where this has happened (and in some cases has already been addressed in the full version of the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Jared, its entirely possible I've got it wrong - funnily enough that's why I'm here asking for advice from experienced gamers (allegedly). No-one is going to put themselves through the sort of flagellation you get on an open forum if they think they know it all already,unless they have an intensely masochistic streak.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstone: thank you for your comments. The bonuses were set to balance the sliding scale of difficulties and weight the rolls in the players' favour; I make no bones about this, I want the players to succeed more than they fail. Constant failure with a system that's weighted against you leads to frustration and miserableness. I want players to enjoy themselves, but there still to be the capacity in the rules for those "Oh bugger!" moments when the world hates you (hence the natural 1 rule). The system isn't meant to accurately model real world situations, but then again, you do get highly trained professionals screwing up and complete imbeciles doing extraordinarily well in real life, so who knows...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character sheet idea is also a useful suggestion, thank you. Yes, I do want the players' imaginations to have free reign and I don't want to get too rigid in descriptions. But, having said that, one of the playtesters did suggest that each area should be more prescriptive and that there should be a set of well-defined abilities for each one so that people knew where to aim; this is something I plan to investigate at Conpulsion and its interesting to see that several people are generally suggesting similar things. She did also ask about character development; originally, one concept I toyed with was specialisms in an area, which I may well adapt as a means of enabling character development for those that want it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany of my players are live roleplayers that are used to "invisible" systems; in the one we've all played for years, everyone has one skill at which they are *the* expert in that field and can't really be beaten. The rest is up to them to roleplay and it hasn't led to one dimensional, boring characters that can do everything. I don't think, therefore, that three skills is boring per se, it what you do with them that counts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256317/#Comment_256317" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T10:09:56+00:00" title="February 12, 2010 10:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lynne H</cite>I avoid games like Burning Wheel like the plague as I find they stifle player creativity by being far too prescriptive and overwhelming.<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>But, having said that, one of the playtesters did suggest that each area should be more prescriptive and that there should be a set of well-defined abilities for each one so that people knew where to aim; this is something I plan to investigate at Conpulsion and its interesting to see that several people are generally suggesting similar things.</blockquote>\nI wanted to pull out these two statements, Lynne, because there's a conflict here, as people have pointed out to you in this thread and from playtesting.

One GM might throw out 3s, 4s, and 5s in a particular set of circumstances, while another GM in the same situation would set them all at 6, or even 7. It would help if you got just a little bit prescriptive, and listed some concrete difficulties. This would also help guide players towards what you expect characters to be doing in the game, even before they look at the setting material. So, like, average difficulties for swinging across the room on a chandelier, for reprogramming Prof. Moriarty's Babbage machine, for seducing a German duke when you don't speak German, etc. Perhaps also a guideline for making actions more difficult due to adverse situations -- like, if leaping from the zeppelin onto the roof of the cathedral in the day would be difficulty 4, you should only increase that to 5 at night in a storm, and not +1 for darkness, and +1 for the storm both.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I see the chart goes up to 8. You might want to consider capping it lower that that. If the highest possible difficulty is 6, you always have a 1-in-3 chance of success with any of your three skills, or capped at 7, you always have 1-in-3 with your best skill. That would also tend to push arbitrary difficulties lower, because it alters the GM's perception of how close to the maximum he or she is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256410/#Comment_256410" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T16:46:23+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  4:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing I'd suggest is that you really do need a healing system. Even something as simple as:<br/><br/>a) You always start a game session with no wound penalties. You might still be wounded in the fiction, but not mechanically.<br/><br/>b) At the end of each session, you heal 1 point, and if you get medical attention, you heal 1 point. So if you get taken out, you'll still be wounded next session (if you want characters to stay wounded over the course of sessions).<br/><br/>I mean, you also have a section explaining what roleplaying is. The people who need this section are not going to be real good at making up their own rules, and the people who can write in their own rules don't need you to explain roleplaying to them (and might be able to write the rest of the rules themselves, too). Players can change the rules just as easily as making up new rules, so it would be better for players who don't want to do that to have even really simple rules to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256517/#Comment_256517" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T19:55:17+00:00" title="February 13, 2010  7:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2010 7:56PM by Emily_Care.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks like a fun game that will do what you want it to. Your reasoning behind the weighting fits what seems like the experience one would get out of it. And simple, too. Nice.<br/><br/>Three traits seems to work well for PTA, as well as Over the Edge. They are as loosely defined in Primetime Adventures as in yours, though they may be a bit more limited in PTA. In the same way, they are there to help give the characters a boost in a drama-oriented way. In yours, because the tone is heroic adventure and the goal is to help players succeed. In PtA, the character with spotlight is given more advantage. You have a caveat that GM has final say. Having more guidelines in the creation process might help avoid arguments over interpretation as well. <br/><br/>Throughout the game, it seems like there is an underlying assumption that the GM's job is to help provide adventure and reasonable challenge to the players.  And that the GM has an understanding of how to construct and run and adventure to do that. You might want to talk about that perspective, so as to let GMs that are of Luke's proclivities that they should play something else (like Burning Wheel <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>, or realize that if they are making their players unhappy by regularly juking situations in unbelievable ways to screw the players, that it will be their own fault if the game falls apart. <br/><br/>On the other hand, no reason to worry about them. They'll figure that out on their own. Eventually.  <br/><br/>Some more help, like the guidelines for the traits and difficulties might be good. Story ideas, sources they can draw on. (I kept thinking of TinTin as I read the game.)  Maybe expand on the story ideas etc. to give more structure and point out potential plots from the background to help GMs that need more prompting in the adventure structure department. But you can see how much hand-holding people need as you get the game playtested more.<br/><br/>If you want to have some dialogue between players and GM at the start of the game, the players could pick some aspect of the background that interests them, and then the GM could respond by crafting the adventure around what was picked. Do you determine how the characters know one another? That's a good spot for potential plot hooks too. <br/><br/>If you are writing for folks like your friends who are larpers (yes?), they will probably be interested in having good in-character and inter-player-character interactions. That might be something to think about talking about in your game. So many rpgs end up being "the GM does this, now you make a roll," etc. Which is boring if what you want to do is have fun being your character.  Apocalypse world encouraged a lot of that when I got to play, that might be a game you'd like to look at as a model. (The actual rolls in AW have some similarity to yours, though the traits are wicked different.) Though I doubt the reason for that is written in the game text. It was more like in the world we were each given skills that were direly needed by everyone else, so we interacted to figure out how to help each other do stuff. Needing each other to get by, and having or growing connections with each other may be angles to look at. That is the dynamic in larps, too--in many everyone has a piece of the puzzle that you need to get through. <br/><br/>Hope some of this is of use to you! Best of luck with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lynne%20H" title="Lynne H"><img alt="Lynne H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lynne%20H">Lynne H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256784/#Comment_256784" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T10:27:46+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 10:27AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, predominantly yes I would hope the game would appeal to people who don't like complex main-stream systems and as a temptation to LRPers to put down the costume and come and sit in the warm and dry for a bit. Cakes, it has to be said, is a bit of an in-joke with our LRP group. We did a Victorian steampunky LRP for about 8 years and the motto was "We Stop for Cake" (in Latin, of course); because it was such a social thing, it seemed like the most alliterative way of titling that particular skill area :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJohnstone, there will definitely be more examples of how to set difficulties and suggested skills and a bit more on healing. There will be a great deal more on adventure seeds, guidance for GMs, plot hooks and actual examples of play in the full version as well.
