I also would like to inject a good amount of Mythos Dreamland stuff  (especially Lovecraft's work).  I'd also like to have a boatload of symbolism that is the nature of dreams.<br/>I'm not super familiar with the Dreamlands (yet) so any details on locations or people/beings you'd suggest I include would be fun.<br/>Here are some notes on the investigator and the story so far.  Any ideas you have would be great.  <br/><br/><br/>-  following the "Innsmouth Incident" the investigator is one of a few independent civilians asked to follow-up the situations.  It is 1929 and the group is becoming the origins of Delta Green. <br/><br/>-  the PC investigator is Dr. Franklin Atherton, a psychologist that is becoming known for his occult knowledge.  He has written a book or two investigating the Mythos and also has a small collection of Mythos Tomes.<br/><br/>-  Dr. Atherton found a portal (left by Nyalarthotep), this portal led into the Dreamlands.  So he is physically there.<br/><br/>-  the things he's investigated most are: Deep Ones and the Shan (Insects of Shaggia)<br/><br/>-  he's discovering the Bible (specifically the Vulgate and Septuagint) are important (and connected!) books to the many tomes of the Mythos<br/><br/>-  the player is very open and okay with reading any Mythos Tomes and learning to cast spells<br/><br/><br/><br/>Any thoughts?<br/>-kev-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178204/#Comment_178204" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T13:03:52+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  1:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whenever I play stuff like this, I use Hastur and usually the Delta Green material for it.

I've always felt that the best technique was careful use of the surreal and non-sequiteur, sudden transitions are good, and the feeling of powerlessness that comes from nightmares is something you can do in dreams by just telling players that they can't do the simplest things (e.g. "You hear a sound behind you, but you can't turn around" or "You open your mouth to speak but the words won't come out, just silence).<br/><br/>Of course CoC dreamlands are not quite as heavy handed as that most of the time (though they can be), but the sudden transitions work perfectly.<br/><br/>Another thing to stress is the fact that what you see is always more symbol than reality. The moon really does have a face, a storm is full of claws, when time is short you can hear the clock striking midnight even if there was no clock before. Symbols can also be wonderfully exaggerated in dreams, the full moon takes up half the sky, day and night go past like flickering shadows, you don't get small lighthouses by the sea, you get vast glass towers topped by fire that rise *from* the sea. And so on.<br/><br/>The final technique I use is tricky and I often don't get it right, but for nightmarish sequences you can play off the awful sense of inevitability that real nightmares have, the feeling that you just can't get out of the situation because you *know* whats going to be on the other side of the door, no matter what. It's like railroading yes, but if you do it right the overshadowing sense of nightmare will excuse that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178235/#Comment_178235" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T19:42:57+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  7:42PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2008 7:50PM by JuddG.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The neatest and most counter-intuitive part of dreams to me is the "forced knowledge" nature of dream information.  There are times in dreams where you just KNOW that, if you do this thing, it will lead to some disaster, so the dream "plot" is all about trying to find another way to do it.  Or maybe that is just me.  I have a great deal of dreams where some things are just givens and no explanation of how this lore was acquired is present.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there should be incomplete things and items.  Often in my dreams, there is something that has only a segment of what would really be present in an item or person.  Things like a person's hairdo (real example here) that is not made of hair, it is simply the design of the hairdo.  Another example would be the memory of a statue that was long ago eroded away clinging to the remains of the stone like a ghost.  These incomplete things often have some sort of emotional component related to why they are not fully realized.  Even without that component, such things are quite eerie.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother dream element that is very creepy is the feeling that something going on in the dream is somehow fake or staged.  Sometimes, there is simply a dread of this or just simple knowledge that the anger this person shows is not real, or that the people in the crowd are all hired actors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these items come down to "cognitive misfires" that warp some aspect of reality and interpreting your senses, but all of them are counted by me as the creepy elements of a dream most likely to make me wake up and wonder what that was all about...<br/>\n<br/>\n...I just hope some psychologist isn't out there right now saying, "Yep.  Warm up the rubber room!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178243/#Comment_178243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T21:13:41+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  9:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>The neatest and most counter-intuitive part of dreams to me is the "forced knowledge" nature of dream information.

It doesn't have to be bad either, a lot of dreams I have can revolve around knowing that the way out of a nightmarish situation is just to do some arbitrary and weird thing that I somehow know will make things better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178609/#Comment_178609" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T15:54:48+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  3:54PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just talk to my wife for a day about her dreams and write it all down.

Unfortunately it's way too self-contained, in that real world situations really can't be resolved in any sensible way.<br/><br/>My advice if drifting a current system towards this play is to allow (and encourage) players to work entirely out of the box. It's completely changed how we play, and it's a great mental exercise. Throw out examples of people fighting and resolving conflicts through ignoring one another, say, or looking through a picture book of false memories ("Hey, remember that Christmas where the tree caught on fire?" Roll damage, character has burn scars on their face). Remind them that amorphous physiques are the norm, and blow their limbs off. Every injury should be devastating, and none have mechanical effect unless their metaphorical response does, too.
