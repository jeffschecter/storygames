It's easy to say, "Oh, that's just improv", but it's strongly motivated improv that works off a very wide leeway in use of the pre-existing facts of the scenario.<br/><br/>By that I mean--sure, if you make use of the interstices of prep, you can improvise anything, but there's a point that strains credibility and undermines the legitimacy of the prep. If you don't define the cop's personality beforehand, then you can slot something in on the spur of the moment that'll hit character X's character issues perfectly. Say, character X has an aversion to violence but a dedication to standing up for the little guy, so you decide that the cop'll put the beat down on a hapless immigrant right in front of the character...and nobody else seems willing to do anything...so it's all up to him. Awesome! Conflict! Hard decisions! Well, some people might like that, but to me it feels heavy-handed, contrived, and shallow.<br/><br/>Difference of quality or degree? Maybe you could work up to the conflict, lay the groundwork, give players a chance to get to know their characters and the NPCs. The DitV GMing section has something similar--the idea that you can give a player an easy decision in Town A, then push against that decision in Town B, keep going until a sort of crisis point is reached. In theory it still sounds contrived; in practice I haven't seen it either in person or in actual play reports. Every instance I've seen of people mindfully applying the Bang/Conflict/Escalation strategy, I've been turned off--except where the game is so radically outside the norm that there's no doubt it's an altogether different thing from what I think of as character-perspective roleplaying. (E.g., Polaris still looks like it could be fun.)<br/>So how does the GM make improvised decisions? Randomly. Unconsciously. Whimsically. Falling back on local tropes of the group and general tropes of genre. Extrapolating from the known to the unknown. Depending on the mood at the table, the GM might also choose to bridge from one piece of prep to another--a kind of "say yes". But not with an especially strong aim to push conflicts toward crisis and resolution." </blockquote>\nI had recently finished up a Sorcerer game that I had thought had gone really well.  But maybe it hadn\u2019t?  (This was a game that we played for several months called THE BROTHERHOOD.  You can find some details about the game <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26365.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>I was so startled by this passage I decided to email it to see if maybe I had been doing everything Elliot suggested.  After all, the GM\u2019s experience of the game is different than the Players\u2019 experience (and each Player\u2019s experience different than each other.)<br/><br/>I\u2019m all about concrete reality when it comes to this stuff.  People had played: what was their experience?<br/><br/>So, I sent them Elliot\u2019s post and asked: \u201cOut of curiosity, is this how you experienced THE BROTHERHOOD?  Did things feel forced?  \u2018Heavy-handed, contrived, shallow\u2019?\u201d<br/><br/>Here are some of the responses I got:                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169851/#Comment_169851" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T09:48:58+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  9:48AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 10:18AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Colin replied:</b><br/><i>Nothing was contrived or heavy handed.  He makes it sound like some GM on high just methodically issuing conflict after conflict with no rhyme or reason. As opposed to basing it off of the character flags they give the gm saying "HEY!  I WANT THE GAME TO BE ABOUT THIS".</i><br/><br/><br/><b>Eric replied:</b><br/><i>My experience with "The Brotherhood" was nowhere like that poster was describing. In no way did I feel like my character and by extension I was manipulated based on GM Bangs designed to go directly against my character's flaws or fears. In fact each Bang or Decision Moment or whatever you want to call it seemed to be your (the GM's) lobbing a revelation at me to see how I would react -- neither of us knowing for sure where I will take the story next, which I feel is the reason we play these games. Not because we see just one or two choices ahead of us like rails on the ground, but instead because we're both dying to know how a player will react from a Bang.<br/><br/>Case in point: When David King finally learns the truth from Stubbs about what's happened to his family and why they were targeted, as you mentioned, we're in this crazy prison facility with murderers and criminals, and at that point people are scared of this one father's reaction. And we had to end a session there because it took me a week to get into David's heart and figure out what his next course of action would be. I'm just guessing, but I don't think anyone at that table knew what David was going to do at the start of the next session --- and that's what made it like the best effing show on TV.</i><br/><br/><br/><b>Vasco replied</b><br/><i>I was pretty confused as I read that post you quoted CK, because I was waiting for it to make sense and it never did. It was totally alien compared to my experience in The Brotherhood game. <br/><br/>At all times it felt like the situations and conflicts that unfolded were intrinsically tied to the PCs goals and choices. There was never the case of the NPCs doing these cool and awesome things 'way over here' that had nothing to do with the PCs. Instead, everything dovetailed back into that beautiful relationship map you created around our PCs.<br/><br/>Looking back, David [Eric's PC] was totally capable of leaving the prison to seriously fuck some people up at that point. But that wasn't the path Eric decided to take. And it worked because it wasn't the only option left open to by CK, which made choice and the further development of the story that much more meaningful.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169852/#Comment_169852" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T09:49:50+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  9:49AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2008 11:17PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Point of This Thread</b><br/><br/>There is a gap between Elliot's experience/anticipation of "bangs" and what my Players experienced at the table. When reading Elliot's post, I do not recognize his description of bangs in any meaningful way. Neither did my players. <br/><br/>This thread, then, is about that gap. Or rather, it about how I use Bangs within that gap. The gap is large: Elliot has experienced and anticipates bangs in a certain way; my Players do not recognize what Elliot is talking about.<br/><br/>I make no claim that everyone will like Bangs or should like Bangs. It is a given these days that different people will want different experiences from a roleplaying game. (The heavy lifting on that work was done a decade ago.) I claim only that there are effective ways of using Bangs, and ineffective ways that will most likely annoy the hell out of players. Whether or not someone would like Bangs after soaking up some of the experience I'm posting in this thread is not my concern. It is a thread for the sorts of folks who want Bangs -- and want them to work well as part of the fun of playing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Some Caveats</b><br/><br/><b>I\u2019m not responsible for how other people play.</b>  Other people use Bangs well, others poorly, I suppose.  But I can\u2019t speak for them, nor do I.<br/><br/><br/><b>In the current discussion, I\u2019m only using Bangs in the context of <i>Sorcerer</i></b>.  <i>Sorcerer</i> is a tool for making stories, and all the pieces work together in tandem.  Bangs do not exist in a vacuum.  They are tied \u2013 in my view \u2013 to what is known as \u201cThe Back of The Character Sheet\u201d among <i>Sorcerer</i> Players.  The Back of the Character Sheet (which, in my view, should be on the front) contains the names of NPCs, Places, Things and Incidents tied to each PC\u2019s Price, Lore, Cover and Kicker.  Bangs are also tied to the game's definition of Humanity, Lore and Demons.  Thus, nothing appears willy-nilly and is organic piece of a whole as created by the GM and the Players.<br/><br/>That means I had a list of NPCs.  I knew their agendas.  Their agendas could change.  It also meant that \u2013 since we were playing over the course of several weeks \u2013 that I might add details and go deeper in the backstory design as the PCs came into clearer focus. There\u2019s not shame in this.  Dickens and Robert E. Howard expanded their characters and universe as they wrote, as do serialized TV writers. No shame at all. To keep growing things down and outward as the story becomes clearer is part of the fun.  This doesn\u2019t mean arbitrary.  It means growing more fun and more possibilities. <br/><br/><br/><b>The act of story creation is <i>the</i> fun for me</b>.  My win condition is this: We finish playing and we should have something worthy of being typed up as a short story, movie, or HBO mini-series.  This doesn\u2019t mean I run roughshod over my players forcing them follow my idea of what the story is \u201cgoing to be\u201d or any other bit of nonsense some people fear about games they don\u2019t play.  Everyone at the table is part of this experience.  And given the emails posted above, some folks seem to really enjoy it.<br/><br/>The fun is the same puzzle-building high a writer gets when saying, \u201cOkay, what would be the most interesting thing to have happen here?\u201d  \u201cYeah, we could have a fight, but what would make the fight interesting. Why does it matter?\u201d  It\u2019s not stated or thought out like that bluntly. We\u2019re just sitting around a table having one incident after another happen.  But as creators and audience members of a story (like a staff room of writers working together to build an episode of TV) we get off on putting out ideas, building on them, and feeling the heat when good ideas take off.  <i>That</i> is the fun \u2013 not some theoretical paradigm or punishing each other arbitrary beats or combining things that have no business being together and saying, \u201cBut it\u2019s a Bang!  So it\u2019s good!\u201d <br/><br/>Having actions, revelations, reversals, character decisions, bits of color and business, the rising and release of tension, conflicts that send characters off in wholly unexpected directions, and the enjoyment of watching something grow that could not have been anticipated before <i>is</i> the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169855/#Comment_169855" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T09:52:31+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  9:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 10:04AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Some Notes About My Bangs</b><br/><br/>Through trial and error I\u2019ve found my own way of using Bangs that work for me.  They might not be everyone else\u2019s successful way, but my Players seemed to have a good time.  In the email exchange I had with my Players on this matter, we ended up having a side conversation about Bangs.  <br/><br/><b>During that conversation, I wrote this:</b><br/><br/><i>Kickers are the things that start off the game for the PC.  They are the situation that the Player "authors" for his PC.  They are 1) emotionally grabby in some way to the Player; 2) demand a decision or action on the part of the PC (they can't be ignored); and 3) what that decision is remain open-ended until play ensues (which way the PC responds to the Kicker is unknown until the actual circumstances of the GM framing the scene and the Player interacting with the circumstances in play.)<br/><br/>A Bang is a GM authored moment -- that is in many way like a Kicker. It's a moment the GM tosses at the Player.  It should be grabby.  It demands a choice that is open ended in it's possibilities.  There's no expectation of what that choice will be.  The GM absolutely should NOT think, "And then, when Jimmy finds his wife dead, he'll will want to get revenge, and we'll be on our way to the climax!"  <br/><br/>To make this clear:  Some people think dilemmas ("Should I save Gwen Stacy or the Tram???")  I say, "Nope."  Because that still implies the GM is expecting one of two choices.  I say to hell with that.  When I say open-ended, I mean open ended.<br/><br/>While the Bangs the GM tosses out should be grabby, there's no guarantee the Players will care!  The GM can only toss them out, see if it leads to more interesting things, and then toss out the next Bang.</i><br/><br/><br/><b>In another email I wrote:</b><br/><br/><i>Eric, you wrote:</i><br/><br/>"In fact each Bang or Decision Moment or whatever you want to call it seemed to be your (the GM's) lobbing a revelation at me to see how I would react..."<br/><br/><i>This is pretty much a summation of my own views about Bang (which I think I've mentioned to you guys), which draws heavily from Aristotle's Poetics.  In his view the best dramatic moments come from Revelations and Reversals -- which means that things that audience knows to be true or have assumptions about are reversed, or new facts about the situation are revealed. Usually what is meant by a "twist" in a story (either during the story or at the end) is not a new thing that happens, but the REVELATION of backstory that none of the Protagonists (and the audience) knew about.  Reversals are actual, new developments.  But they can't just be a turn.  REVERSAL is the key word here.  Ripley and the marines go to the colony world to rescue the colonists.  They only find one survivor.  A bunch of marines gets killed by dozens of Aliens breeding in the reactor (Revelation!) and on their way to pick up point to get off planet and complete their mission the shuttle is destroyed -- and now they are as trapped as the lone, surviving colonist (Reversal!  They're not rescuers anymore -- it's a survival mission!)<br/><br/>The strongest way to do this in straight-up drama (TV, Movies, Plays) is to have it revealed through a character's point of view.  In this way, you get an emotional response to the Revelation and Reversal via the Protagonist.  If the Protagonists know all the details of the Revelations and Reversals, but the audience simply gets them doled out as an afterthought it really has little effect. In such cases we're only catching up to what's going on.  This is why Bangs that hit the PCs on this level work so well in a game.<br/><br/>In a lot of RPG play there Revelations and Reversals, but it works at the "mystery" level of story -- "We didn't know what was going on, and now we do!"  But this, to me, isn't as effective as making sure the facts are tied in direct manner to the PCs.  Eric's example of David's discovery of what was happening with his family is a sharp diamond of this kind of Bang, as is Colin's example of Visili staring into the decayed lich Landsfield face and hearing the words, "I don't want to leave" and seeing his own future.<br/><br/>In RPGs, Revelation or Reversal by definition only growing the Bang out the circumstances of the fiction that already been created.  Thus obviating any concern that it's just stuff thrown at the players that has nothing to do with anything that's already been created. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169857/#Comment_169857" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T09:55:47+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  9:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/><br/>You know, there is some interesting stuff going on here, but I'm having real trouble engaging with it amidst all the talk about how Eliot is wrong and out of context and shit -- especially as his wrong out of contextness is both in another thread and feels like you putting words in his mouth. <br/><br/>So, um, yea.

In fact, not much "exists" (is prepped) outside of stuff relating to the characters.<br/><br/>This tendency then loops back to a kind of play I don't like ( and I suspect others also don't like, like, possibly, Bret's players)"<br/><br/>I would also point to the fact that, from outside knowledge, I know that E's interest in RPGs goes back to the 1970s, and the idea of RPG as a superior form of wargame, with the GM taking a role as info provider and neutral "keeper" of the reality.<br/><br/>** Anyway, I think his "Laugh at the primitives" comment is the real key to understanding the whole thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169862/#Comment_169862" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T10:07:05+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 10:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2008 11:17PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited to remove all references to Elliot and his comments except the first quote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169870/#Comment_169870" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T10:39:28+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 10:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 10:41AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another note about Story is the fun:<br/><br/><b>The Protagonists Are the Story</b>  If you watch a movie, there may be wide screen shots of vistas, but usually you are watching the characters. The camera follows the characters. We know the world through the characters.  <br/><br/>This may or may not be everyone's fun.  There is a solid -- and fun! -- tradition of making up a world and having the Players interact with it via their PCs.  The sense of discovery is great, and it's a fun way to play. This kind of fun has inspired great RPG sessions, and great electronic games from <i>Myst</i> to <i>Bioshock</i>.  <br/><br/>The story-focused game is simply different.  There is a world, but there world is there to test the Protagonists.  It is there to provide focus back at the characters.  The characters are forced to make choices because of the world around them -- and in making choices they reveal who they are.  <br/><br/>In the movie <i>Aliens</i> I know almost zip about the world of the future.  I mean, really, almost nothing.  I know just enough to surround Ripley and her fellow travelers with trouble and choices.  That's the purpose of the sets and the landscapes <i>around</i> a character in a movie. <br/><br/>Now, as stated, this doesn't make one kind of fun better than another.  (At least not for me.)  I've enjoyed both -- and continue to do so.  But they are very different.  And the main thing is, that because they are different a) all the Players have to be on board with this kind of play; b) and the fun comes from everyone being into have their characters making decisions.  The fun is in that focus... just like it is a writer's job to make sure that the events in a story in are grounded in the choices of the protagonists.<br/><br/><br/><b>In the email exchange from above Eric wrote:</b><br/><br/><i>CK, all of that is spot-on, in my opinion, in particular when you write that the Revelations need to be nested in the POV of the character(s). And be directed at them instead of at anyone.<br/><br/>If the movie The Matrix were a campaign of an RPG, I could see some GMs making the big revelation is -- "Surprise, the world you knew all your life is just an artificial construct. It's not reality!" That's pretty shocking and revealing... The real revelation in a <b>story</b> isn't that beat, though. It's, "I believe you are The One, Neo. The only one who will save us all." Because that is character-centric.</i><br/><br/><b>To which I added:</b><br/><br/><i>And, strangely (cause I never thought of this before), the reveal of the "the way things are" in The Matrix is almost an afterthought to a series of "bangs" that are about something else.<br/><br/>Neo is asked to trust a stranger's voice on the phone -- and doesn't.  <br/><br/>He tracks down someone who can help him, but she says, "I can you show you, but I can't tell you..." and he decides to go.<br/><br/>Later, he's told he has a choice of two pills -- one will reveal the truth, the other will wipe all memories about his concerns from his mind. He takes the pill to press forward -- and we get the reveal out of that. But the BANG was the choice at the pills.<br/><br/>In other words, the movie isn't about the big reveal (which only lasts a second, after all), but about TRUST.  In Sorcerer Humanity terms, that's what the movie is about.  You can see it from the start of the movie building to Neo's final decision at the movie's climax when he takes on the agents and wins.</i><br/><br/><br/>Now, clearly Eric and I are writing from the POV of a story focused game. Which is the point of this particular post.  Some focus and tools and techniques float the boat of some kinds of games, and others don't.  <br/><br/>When I'm playing for <i>story</i>, the focus is the Characters.  And the Players all know this.  We're going to be creating details and scenes and moments of interaction between characters that would be worth capturing on film.  This is a specific pleasure -- working within this constraint of making the narrative beats character and thematic based.  Some don't like it.  Others do.<br/><br/>But the key is that in a story focused game "the world" is not the focus of interest.  The focus of interest is the characters and who they are after making many choices.  The Bangs provide those choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169881/#Comment_169881" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:11:32+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>But the key is that in a story focused game "the world" is not the focus of interest.

It's more an issue of GM as neutral keeper of the "reality".<br/><br/>As part of that 'neutral keeper" role, shit does not constantly circle the PCs and their issues, emotional or otherwise, although sometimes it very much will impact them.<br/><br/>And,yeah, a different flavor of RPG. Players aware of those differences of flavor can make some informed decisions on how the thing works. People unaware, not so much, and that seems to be where the whole original railroading complaint in the original thread came from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169886/#Comment_169886" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:23:52+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 11:30AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert,<br/><br/>An excellent clarification.  My bad for phrasing it that way.<br/><br/>Better to say: In a game focused on story, the fictional world is not neutral.  It does not exist outside the interests of the PCs.  That is not to say things change and shift willy-nilly or at whim, or that NPCs do not have their own agendas that they act on.  It <i>is</i> to say that ultimately all these fictional elements -- even when existing "independent" of the PCs -- are there to be tapped to put pressure on the PCs to make choices. <br/><br/>Again, I use the example of movies or television shows: the amount of stuff that we don't know about the world around the characters -- even when we're dealing with strange environments -- is <i>enormous</i>.  The camera follows the Protagonists.  In a game of <i>Sorcerer</i> the characters are Protagonists, by definition.  The camera follows them.  They are the points of interest.  Selective elements of the world "out there" arrive in frame (whether it is an NPC who arrives or a store the PC goes to) that will reveal the parts or details that will shine a light on or spark in some way more details about the PC.  That is the job of the world around the Protagonist in a game where creative play is focused on story.<br/><br/>As a GM, then, my job is to throw focus on the fictional world's established NPCs and settings the most interesting bits for the PCs, and in turn throw focus on the PCs via those elements to get the PCs to make choices .  This is the focus, the challenge and a great deal of fun.  It isn't always easy.  It means orbiting the PCs while holding the fictional world in the head and selecting which bits to meet with the PCs on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169887/#Comment_169887" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:29:59+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 11:33AM by komradebob.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>Better to say: In a game focused on story, the fictional world is not neutral.

This is both the great thing about Story games type games and their great bane. Frankly, it's great to be able to strap in and jump right to that kind of thing without wandering around game session after game session to find that place.<br/><br/>On the downside:<br/>1) Damn but it can be draining!<br/>2) If you aren't used to it, it can look like "emotional" railroading. After all, everything ends up <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aimed right at you</span>!(or you + your character). I mean, a narr-y GM can look like a over-caffienated sadist at times, even after you've been exposed to the core concepts.<br/><br/>Now, I did mention that I'd GMed a couple games for Elliot, and I was wondering how his comments matched what I knew from being on the GM side of the screen. The game incidently was Basic D&amp;D ( we were feeling retro...). Anyway, my MO with most traddy games is to start out fairly neutral, then sculpt more and more towards the PCs + their players interests over time, until it gets to the point where things are almost akin to your story-game style with it's camera focus. In this case, the character issues are more an evolved state, than a preloaded thing. I really don't know how El feels about that bit of info, but really, that's the part I was curious about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169890/#Comment_169890" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:38:54+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a related note, I do think you can have sandbox-like play and still make events relevant to the characters (and more importantly, the players).

YES!  It's hard -- for both the Players and the GM. But it is also exhilarating.  It's the selection of aesthetically -- correct?/interesting? -- that you know are right as all the pieces fit together in a whole.  It's the same rush a writer or actor gets when they know they are "right" about the choice they have found or made in revealing something about a character.<br/><br/>Which is why I would say to your second point:  It's not just a matter of not being used to it.  It's a matter if you even want do <i>deal</i> with it.  The effort involved presses certain buttons.  And like going to the gym to lift weights or sitting down to write a screenplay or working a gymnastics routine, one is either jazzed from the effort of progress or "got it!" moments or one is not.  The fun is there for some people, and not there for others.  And there's no rhyme or reason.  One of my friends is writing a show for CBS.  His response to <i>Primetimes Adventures</i> was, "More story?!?! Great!!!"  Another friend of mine, a story editors on a CBS show, sat down to play <i>PtA</i> and said, "I do this for a job! Why would I want to do this now?"<br/><br/>It's not big deal that people like different things.  What is a big deal is recognizing that a game like <i>Sorcerer</i> (or <i>PtA</i>, or <i>Polaris</i>, or a host of other games), have tools to evoke story as the act of pleasure.  And either someone is going to get a buzz from circling that as the focus -- or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169893/#Comment_169893" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T11:50:10+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 11:50AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2008 11:51AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>I want to be careful here.<br/><br/>I doubt there are many games, of any stripe, where the events are <i>not</i> relevant to the PCs.<br/><br/>This is a thread about Bangs.

I polled my players for a reaction to this statement -- just to make sure I really wasn't missing something important.  You can read the emails I got from them upthread.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Judd whispered to me on the other thread and asked me to start a thread about Bangs. My head is full of comments about Bangs and I'm spilling them out.  <br/><br/>I kicked off the thread with the quoted post and the responses from an Actual Play group of Players talking about their actual play.  I think it was a good way to start the thread.  I started with the fears a lot of people have about playing a game like <i>Sorcerer</i> and the nightmare sloppiness that some people fear Bangs will bring about.  And then my players -- to a person -- said, "Nope.  That's not the way it goes down."  I liked starting it that way.  It clears the assumptions with Actual Play quickly -- directly responding to those assumptions.  And now we're into, "Okay, so what did the GM do get that kind of reaction from the Players."<br/><br/>I'm not defending anything.  There's nothing to defend.  It would be like saying someone needs to defend making a movie because sometimes bad movies are made.  The question on the table for me is, "How can we more reliably make good movies?"<br/><br/>I didn't see the posts as an attack on Bangs or story-driven play.  I saw the statements as <i>wrong</i>.  I checked with my players to see if I was right about that.  Apparently I was.<br/><br/>Now my focus is, "Okay.  So what did I do?

When reading Elliot's post, I do not recognize his description of bangs in any meaningful way. Neither did my players. <br/><br/>This thread, then, is about that gap. Or rather, it about how I use Bangs within that gap. The gap is large: Elliot has experienced and anticipates bangs in a certain way; my Players do not recognize what Elliot is talking about.<br/><br/>I make no claim that everyone will like Bangs or should like Bangs. It is a given these days that different people will want different experiences from a roleplaying game. (The heavy lifting on that work was done a decade ago.) I claim only that there are effective ways of using Bangs, and ineffective ways that will most likely annoy the hell out of players. Whether or not someone would like Bangs after soaking up some of the experience I'm posting in this thread is not my concern. It is a thread for the sorts of folks who want Bangs -- and want them to work well as part of the fun of playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170288/#Comment_170288" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T11:31:07+00:00" title="September 20, 2008 11:31AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2008 1:07PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>\u201dA Problem Right Now\u201d</b><br/><br/>The term \u201cBang\u201d was first introduced on page 77 in the rules of <i>Sorcerer</i>.

The character comes home from a long trip, and, with no warning, discovers that his wife has become addicted to opium in his absence...<br/><br/>Since there were no clues that it was coming, there was nothing he could do to prevent it. And since it went completely counter to the sort of person he understood his wife to be, it didn't seem plausible -- no principles of the imagined universe he was aware of indicated that this sort of thing might happen. <br/><br/>It didn't go over well.</blockquote>\nWhen I read this description, the part that stood out to me was this: \u201cNo principles of the imagined universe he was aware of indicated that this sort of thing might happen.\u201d<br/><br/>As noted above, Bangs in <i>Sorcerer</i> can only grow effectively out  of the fictional circumstances of play.  This would include details found on the Character Sheets (Kicker, Price, Cover, Lore), as well as world setting details (including the definitions of Lore, Demons, Humanity), and the background setting itself (NPCs, factions of one kind or another, objects and circumstances of value).<br/><br/>If one is using another game and using Bangs, the Bangs must still be drawn from a wealth of fictional material created by the GM and the Players.  If not, one runs the risk of making arbitrary Bangs \u2013 slapping blocks of wood behind the PC in the expectation of delight \u2013 but only getting, as in the Actual Play report above \u2013 \u201cIt didn\u2019t go over well.\u201d<br/><br/>Why is that?  <br/><br/>Because humans are pattern making creatures. And patterns have both Unity (things going along as they are) and Variety (disruption of unity that grows out of the overall pattern.)  If the Variety simply comes out of nowhere, it is not pleasing.  It does not satisfy.  It frustrates.<br/><br/>If you are watching a movie and it\u2019s a cop procedural and twenty minutes before the movie ends the cop can suddenly fly and has the ability to burn people with X-Ray eyes and solves the case with these powers, you wouldn\u2019t be satisfied.  You would mock the movie.  You would laugh.<br/><br/>The same is true with Bangs in RPGs.  If they simply come out of nowhere, with no rhyme or reason, the Players will be frustrated.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s a limit test:<br/><br/>If you were watching a movie, and the Bang you were thinking of throwing at the Players occurred onscreen, would you lean forward thinking, <i>\u201cI wonder what the character is going to do now?\u201d</i> or would you think, \u201cWhere the hell did that come from?\u201d<br/><br/>After all, Bangs are part of a shared storytelling experience. This is the prima focus of playing with Bangs \u2013 to build a story.  That is the point.  So if something happens that would make you balk in a movie or a TV show, everyone at the table would have every reason to balk during an RPG session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170290/#Comment_170290" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T11:38:46+00:00" title="September 20, 2008 11:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Bangs Demand Choices, but the Choices are Not Given</b><br/><br/>As stated up thread, making a character choose between one of two choices is not a Bang.  It is a dilemma.  And if the Player (via the PC) really only has two choices, it doesn\u2019t count as a Bang.  A Bang is an event or incident that demands an action on the part of the PC.  Which way the PC jumps is what makes the next part of the story.<br/><br/>This doesn\u2019t mean a dilemma can\u2019t be a Bang.  It just means that the Player can choose any response he or she wants in response to the dilemma.<br/><br/>For example, in the movie <i>Spider-Man</i> Mary Jane Watson is thrown off the Queensboro Bridge by the Green Goblin. The situation is especially tricky, as the Goblin also sends a cable car loaded with passengers falling to the river at the same time.<br/><br/>In RPG terms, the GM might say, \u201cYou can save the Cable Car or Gwen! Which do you choose?!?!\u201d<br/><br/>I\u2019m going to say right now that without doubt there are many GMs who do exactly this sort of thing.  I will go further and state that many of them assume they are doing something they would call a Bang.  I\u2019m also here to say, \u201cNo.  They are not.\u201d<br/><br/>In the context of an RPG (specifically a game supported by fictional material and story-creation play that supports Bangs), the GM might have the Goblin toss Mary Jane off one side of the bridge and send the tram plummeting off the other.  However, for such a situation to be a Bang, what the Player decides to do in response is completely open.<br/><br/>The Player might have Spider-Man go only for Mary Jane.  Or only for the Tram.  Or go for both.  (Which, rules wise, would start making things trickier.)  Or the Player might have Spider-Man rip off his mask and say, \u201cFuck this shit.\u201d  Or he might have Spider-Man attack the Goblin to make sure the villain can\u2019t escape to harm anyone else.  Or anything.<br/><br/>So, to be clear: The Player must choose a course of action for the PC (which might include ignoring the situation!), but the GM cannot layout in any meaningful way which course of action the PC is supposed to choose from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170293/#Comment_170293" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T11:40:49+00:00" title="September 20, 2008 11:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher,<br/><br/>Do you use more bangs that were pre-written or bangs that grow out of play in the midst of the game.<br/><br/>Do you make a formal list or do you kind of eye their sheets and think in your head?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170311/#Comment_170311" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T12:51:50+00:00" title="September 20, 2008 12:51PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUuGSCsh96c" rel="nofollow">this previous discussion on bangs</a> might be useful in moving this thread forward.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170312/#Comment_170312" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T13:04:47+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  1:04PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Judd,<br/><br/>I use a mix of both pre-planned Bangs and and Bangs I make up on the spot.  <br/><br/>I don't make formal lists.  For the pre-planned Bangs I simply review my prep materials and the character sheets some time in the week between games.  I think, "Oh, that's interesting," and know there's some great reveal or reversal that would work well as a Bang.  (That said, I always know the Players not care about it and ignore it!)<br/><br/>Other Bangs occur to me on the spot in the context of play in the moment.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell you which was more pre-planned or on the spot -- and I think that's a really telling point.  I try to be alert the possibility of Bangs, if that makes sense.  A good Bang, in my view, grows out of the moment at hand -- whether in the context of a scene or in respect to the rhythms of scenes as they flow from one to the next.<br/><br/><br/>In terms of pre-planned Bangs, I've probably got about two or six Bangs floating around in my head at any time.  But I don't mean I've got two or six that I <i>know</i> I'll be laying down on the table that night.  All I know is that there's a bunch of cool Bangs that I've got on hand that I can trigger <i>when the time is right</i>.  In this regard they I think of them less like Bang in a Bandolier (a phrase many people use), than "Stuff I know from the prep-background I can share with the Players to create a Bang."  The Bandolier metaphor really doesn't work for me (but it might work brilliantly for other people!)  My problem with it is it makes my head focus to much on looking for moments to have a specific Bang happen -- which can lead to all sorts of grinding and pushing or forcing Bangs into spots where they don't belong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170313/#Comment_170313" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T13:06:01+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  1:06PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's an example of how I used prep-material to create a Bang during play.  Was it pre-planned or on the spot?  I would have a difficult time saying.  But I think it will be informative.  It's from from <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26365.0" rel="nofollow">The Brotherhood</a> game I ran:<br/><br/>In the game, Eric (a Player) had a character (David) who had a daughter murder who was murdered by a cult.  His wife went insane from the murder was is sent to a hospital.  The cult leader is safely ensconced in a prison and gets off an a technicality, though David's own (pre-game) research makes him certain this man ordered the murder.  He goes to jail to get vengeance upon this man.  While in prison he realizes there's Sorcerous Lore floating around.  He grabs at it in oder to accomplish his goals. <br/><br/>So, that's all background stuff.  Everything in that previous paragraph came out of the character creation session.<br/><br/>I then take all that and go off to do my GM prep.  I come up with more NPCs.  I flesh out the Cult Leader.  I figure out the wants and the needs of the NPCs, their relationships to each other and to the PCs.  I end up knowing a LOT more about the background than the PCs do.<br/><br/>So, I arrive at a session knowing something Eric does not:  I know that David's wife an affair with the cult leader years ago and the daughter isn't even his daughter -- her father is the cult leader!   I know why the Cult Leader did this (David's wife was part of a lineage of Sorcerers (as his the cult leader) and a child produced by them would be a powerful sacrifice according to the game's Lore.)<br/><br/>Okay, I know this right?  I KNOW David has ruined his life to get justice against a man who killed girl he does not know is not his daughter.  <br/><br/>Now, clearly, this is a Bang.  Because I know that when Eric/David finds this out, there WILL be a reaction.  But, and this is key, I have no idea what the reaction will be.<br/><br/>But is it a Bang?  Well, that's the point I'm trying to make right now. I don't think it's a Bang YET -- because a Bang is not a Bang till it hits the fiction.  Right now, in my head, before I deliver it, it's just information.  I have it on tap.  And I'm pretty sure -- given several weeks of play we've already got behind us -- that at some point something will happen to tap this information.  However -- and this is key -- even if we never get to it, that will be all right too.  <br/><br/>So, were in the middle of a session and Vasco character Roman drag David along to sneak into another cell block to confront an inmate that is trying to kill Roman.  And Eric realizes that this NPC, Stubbs, might have the dirt on his little girl -- because since getting into prison he's gotten information might be alive after all!  (That was the Kicker Eric built for David.) <br/><br/>And David rushes up to confront Stubbs and demands he tell him the truth about his daughter.<br/><br/>Now, here was the weird moment for me.  Remember, I hadn't set a spring-trap that said, "When they talk to NPCs X, Y, or Z, Eric finds out the man he's trying to kill fathered the girl he thinks is his daughter."  There are a gazillion ways this fact might be uncovered from all sorts of interactions with the fictional world and characters.  I just know it's a fact waiting to be sprung.  So Eric, in some really great, intense roleplaying gets right in my face as I'm playing Stubbs, a father who desperately needs to know what happened to his little girl... <br/><br/>And this little light bulb goes off in my head -- "Hey, would Stubbs know what is going on with the cult leader, David's wife, the little girl, and David?  I mean, I didn't know.  Since I'm open to my Player going anywhere or doing anything I don't pretend to know everything that is "real" in the world.  And I might have known what Stubbs knew about David's daughter if I'd ever thought about it.  But as I said to my Players after the session, I didn't even think Stubbs was going to get any screen time that night.  At the end of the previous session the third NPC had started a prison riot and I had assumed the session was going to be about THAT.  I didn't suspect that Roman and David would use the riot as a distraction to sneak to another cell block and confront Stubbs!<br/><br/>So, I'm standing them (Eric and I are standing at this point, miming the motions of David and Stubbs as David confront Stubbs in Stubb's cell) and I'm thinking, "What does Stubbs know about this?"  I start running the facts in my head: Stubbs is a major Sorcerer in the penitentiary, in charge of one of three cell block buildings that are actually demons.  He is battling the cult leader directly, who also has bound one of the cell blocks.  He has a high lore and has been living in the penitentiary for a while.  It occurs to me that Stubbs knows a LOT about what is going on.  And he's so scared of David at that moment he starts dumping info...<br/><br/>And he tells David the girl he thought was his own daughter is actually not.<br/><br/>Bang.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170314/#Comment_170314" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T13:06:09+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  1:06PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's a man who has ruined his life to get vengeance, who has just discovered he's trying to avenge the murder of a daughter who isn't his daughter, that he's a cuckold, and that <i>the girl is still alive</i> and cult leader is still trying to kill her.  What is David going to do?  <br/><br/>Well, that's Eric's decision and I have no idea!  I mean, it was just a crazy moment at the table as Eric, Colin and Vasco froze upon hearing the words and everyone had no idea what would happen next.  All sorts of questions were suddenly present; though they remained unarticulated and mostly likely never intellectualized: What does it mean to be a father?  Did David consider himself still the girl's father since he raised her for eight years?  Would he take action on her behalf even if he didn't consider her his daughter?  What would this mean with his relationship with his wife?  Would he just walk away and wash his hands of the whole mess?  I really had no idea what was going to happen.<br/><br/>Moreover, Colin and Vasco, the other two players, might have some opinions about this as well.  Would Vasco or Colin have their characters try to save her if Eric has David blow the little girl off?  What is David's relationship to the little girl?  If David went off to kill his wife (and again, he might! I don't know!) will Vasco have Roman try to stop him, and so on...<br/><br/>So, that was a Bang that was both "pre-planned" and arrived at "in the midst of the game."  I'll get to a post about a Bang I made up on the spot in another post, but I want to add a few more comments about this Bang.<br/><br/>Given what I said above it being important that Bangs grow out of the fiction and not just arrive out of the blue, what was the context for this Bang?\n<ul>\n<li>Eric's Kicker for David was, "I find out my daughter is still alive."  So we knew that relationship stuff between David and the daughter was important and of interest to David.  Having him be <i>a</i> father the girl without being <i>the</i> father to the girl turn that Kicker up to white hot and made an excellent Bang for it.<br/></li><li>Colin's character, Visilli, controlled had bound one of the cell block demons. His Kicker was, "My nephew arrived at the penitentiary and is making a move to take control of my cell block."  So we had already established themes of family responsibility and family complications as part of the game even before play began.  Sowing seeds thematically does a lot to lead all sorts of Bangs to being viable.<br/></li><li>Eric, a very bright guy, had been wondering, "Why David's daughter?  Was it just coincidence, or is there some bigger puzzle piece I'm missing here?"  The Bang filled in some info and answered questions that the Players (in audience half of our duel role as storyteller and audience) wanted answered.<br/></li><li>Several strange behaviors of David's wife (sent off to an asylum) now made sense -- since she was both dealing with guilt and because she was, in fact, a Sorcerer trying to keep her daughter safe from the cult leader.  Again, when you <i>answer</i> a question the audience has they are happy to get the info!<br/></li><li>The Lore for The Brotherhood was abuse and submission.  The cult leader had fathered several children years ago because, according to my definition of the lore, not greater abuse could be inflicted of that of parent upon child.  In fact, the cult leader was trying to gain power to prevent his own father (also a cult leader and Sorcerer) from getting to him and kill him!  Though dark and terrible, the Bang fit the pattern of the Lore that had been establish.</li>\n</ul>\nGiven all that, even though the Bang was a complete surprise, it grew from the patterns already established in the fiction and so felt a part of the fiction and not an <i>intrusion</i> into the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170328/#Comment_170328" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-20T17:24:09+00:00" title="September 20, 2008  5:24PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2008 5:24PM by Arminius.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><b>The Point of This Thread</b><br/><br/>There is a gap between Eliot's experience/anticipation of "bangs" and what my Players experienced at the table.

If you haven't played Sorcerer, and thus used Bangs as an incorporated part of the system, then their use and function may be hard to grasp, but it doesn't mean they don't work.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting what Chris describes as a "Bang is not a Bang till it hits the fiction." So, even if I have a list of potential bangs in my notebook for the coming session, all based on the game's fiction so far and the player characters, they are only that: ideas. They may not even be used, because a Bang that you "discover" and use during play is often much more twangy. Or my list of Bang ideas may be used all of them, if the fiction goes that way, or some of them might be used in play, maybe more or less tweaked from the original ideas I had when noting them down. Nobody is able to tell before actually getting down to play.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170490/#Comment_170490" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T10:00:20+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 10:00AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This whole "Gap" highlights why I've been saying for years that GNS Simulationism is fundamentally broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no trouble at all seeing what Elliot dislikes about bangs and why they are totally BAD techniques for the sort of play he likes.  This is the largest gap in all of roleplaying.  Larger than Role vs. Roll.  Larger than rules heavy vs. rules light.  Larger than free form vs. system matters.  This is IT.  This is the big canyon that seperates roleplayers into those who want their games to be simulations and those that don't.  Very few people live happily on both sides of that canyon.  Some (like myself) used to live on the simulation side of the canyon but crossed over because I no longer have the time and patience required to do those games properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimulation role play is like a science experiment.  You know how in chemistry class you mixed this chemical and that chemical together, heated it to a certain temperature, added something else and then reported on the results...that simulation play.  In a science experiment there are certain things you're allowed to adjust and everything else is a control.  You can't futz with the controls no matter how badly you want to...if you do, you invalidate the whole experiment.  I'll say that again...invalidate...as in wrong...as in wasted time...as in unuseable result...as in something to be avoided at all costs.  Invalidate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what bangs are, or what they very easily can be...futzes with the controls.  It may be the coolest thing ever to have this character and that character come into conflict over this issue.  But if you use hard scene framing techniques to throw the two characters together just to see what happens...you've futzed with a control.  If they just happen to come together organically, then fine...but no fair forcing that to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where we went around and around on the Forge when Simulationist discussions came up, and where despite my repeated tablepounding GNS kept getting it wrong.  Narrativist play is all about recognizing that there are certain moments in play that are (or have the potential to be) impactful (even transcendent) and using certain techniques (like hard scene framing, like bangs) to compress the time between those moments.  I've come to really like that play alot, largely because I don't have the time to wait for those moments to "just happen".  But for a true Simulationist those techniques...that artificial compression...is futzing with the control and invalidating the experiment.  Just as a gamist might sneer at fudging as cheating and invalidating the competition so a Simulationist will snear at these compression techniques as cheating and invalidating the simulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't particularly ever want to play a game where "lets get to the good stuff...right now" is considered invalid again.  But I used to play that way all the time.  It is not a divide that can be crossed casually, and no amount of explaining what a bang is or how it works will help...because the very concept of what a bang is for is anathaema to the very concept of what a simulation does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider it a personal disappointment of mine that I couldn't get this concept drilled into the GNS canon before the theory forums were shut down...because, as can be seen, its still an issue that makes communication difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170505/#Comment_170505" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T11:03:42+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 11:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But, Ralph... the compression of time to "get to the good stuff" happen in simulationist play ALL THE TIME!

Obliviously not, the difference can't be the about the existence of "compression techniques", nor can be about the "inside the fiction" existence of bangs: characters make hard choices all the time even in simulationist gaming. What change is the point-of-view you use (if you look at the choices looking at theme, self-expression, tactical advantage, etc.).<br><br>It seems to me that the problem is that SOME choices, SOME shortcuts, are seen as "game breaking" while others are not... even if they would be completely appear the some from the point of view of a character! Even if the "solidity" of the fiction plausibility is the same, or even enhanced (blind chance seems less "realistic" that deliberate choices that appear random, this is known by everybody who rolled on a rpg table....).  And that differentiation is not based on any principle I recognize, for any example of somwething unacceptable there is something that is exactly the same thing that is perfectly accepted. <br><br>I tend to think it's simply cultural. Habits. The difference is only in the eye of the beholder.<br><br>(I am not saying that anybody would like anything. I am saying that often a player dissatisfied with a game, for a clash of CA or any other reason, tend to give the blame to some ephemera, or even techniques, as "unacceptable", even i he have no problem using the same tecniques, or some variant, in games he like, not recognizing them out of that context. The purely aesthetic differentiation between the compression of the time of the sleep of the character and the compression of the time the character don't do anything "thematically interesting" is a differentiation based on what the player find interesting and the rhythm of the game, not on the technique. But it's the technique that gets tagged as "unacceptable" even if that player always used it himself to avoid roleplaying 8 hours of a character sleeping...)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170509/#Comment_170509" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T11:09:38+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 11:09AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2008 12:53PM by Max Higley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ralph,<br><br>Paraphrasing you, it looks like the core of the issue is that some players want the fiction to proceed according to observable rules or principles like a science experiment.  As you said, this means no futzing with the controls.  Other players are more interested in situations that allow you to explore issues together, and which provide decision points that enable meaningful choices.  In order to create the sorts of situations that provide fun choices more consistently, they're willing to futz with the controls to get them.<br><br>If I'm understanding you correctly, then that's also precisely the difference between <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=167551" rel="nofollow">the Strategist and Radical modes</a> that I've been talking about.  While there's not a direct mapping between GNS and these modes, Sim and Gamism are strongly Strategist flavored, while Nar is pretty heavily Radical flavored.  Paralleling that, or perhaps because of it, the insistence on some underlying principles of how the imagined world works is something that GNS Sim and Gamism share, and that makes them much closer to each other than to GNS Nar.<br><br>(As for the other modes, I'd guess that the Manager mode prefers a more simulation style game, but may not be as adamant about it as the Strategist.  The Warrior and Guardian modes probably don't care either way.)<br/><br/>-- Max                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170529/#Comment_170529" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T12:28:23+00:00" title="September 22, 2008 12:28PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2008 12:30PM by Valamir.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't buy that actually Moreno.  Having spent alot of time thinking about it...and even a few threads on the Forge where I argued the same thing, I don't think so.  It goes back to the experiment notion again.  Lets say I'm in a class and I'm doing an experiment and I futz with the controls...and nobody catches me...because from the perspective of an observer the experiment looks exactly the same as if I hadn't futzed with the controls.  But just because it wasn't caught isn't the same thing as being accepted (as any sim player who's caught their GM using Illusionist techniques will agree).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that ALOT of it is habit, what we've grown accustomed to enjoying.  I've been able to grow quite comfortable with a style of play that at one point I would have labeled "not real roleplaying" in much the same way as, at one point, I labeled Sorcerer as "not a real roleplaying game".  But just because I switched camps doesn't mean that the camps are actually the same thing.  Ideologically the camps are utterly incompatable...but defections are possible.  And further, a number of people who were in one camp by default (because that's what their group was) but who were more ideologically suited to the other camp, can now find defection to be pretty easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which is to say only this:  No matter how well Christopher describes using Bangs in this thread (pretty darn IMO), it will still only be useful to people who already live on that side of the divide, and will still be nothing but an intellectually interesting bit of information (at best) for those on the other.  No amount of explanation is capable of reconciling these two priorities...IMO...ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170578/#Comment_170578" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-22T19:26:02+00:00" title="September 22, 2008  7:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, would you agree that Pendragon is a game that bridges that divide to some extent?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170648/#Comment_170648" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T08:35:20+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  8:35AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If by "bridges that divide" you mean people in both camps can play and enjoy Pendragon, yes.
