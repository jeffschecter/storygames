I've mentioned this idea to some local gamers, most of which have outright scoffed at the notion.  It seems that "leveling up" (so to speak) has become a crucial part of the long-term play process.  But what can be done instead?  What methods are available to suitably substitute for "advancement" in a game campaign?<br/><br/>I ask, because I've been toying with some new proto-ideas for a game - a game which I want to be able to facilitate enjoyable multi-session and even long-term play.  But the more I think about it, the traditional concept of mechanical character advancement just doesn't fit well within my vision of this game.  However, I fear that without it, I might lose the interest of some of the players.<br/><br/>What do you suggest, SG?  What other rewards, tangible or otherwise, can be offered?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200101/#Comment_200101" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T09:31:04+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  9:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played The Shadow of Yesterday?

It's a common approach to LARP play, actually, so that new players aren't totally gimpy compared to experienced players, which creates a two-speed game (low-level content and high-level content must be provided, every game).<br/><br/>Longer answer: you might be confusing "advancement" with "reward." I don't think you can successfully remove reward for play from long-term play. That reward, however, needn't be a mechanical change in character efficacy (and the commensurate inflation of opposition efficacy--the arms race). For instance, a reward could be allowing the player more authority over the game world or play situations. Again, this approach is common in LARP--players become "lords" or "barons" or otherwise enjoy benefits of rank that don't provide efficacy but might provide a better cabin at the campsite, or a say in out-of-game plot planning. Another way to constrain advancement is to provide it as one-shot gains rather than persistent ability, or provide item rewards which (typically) can't all be used at once--flexibility, not additional efficacy. Another way might be to provide "experience," but it only applies to a subsequent character (an "heir").<br/><br/>Basically... read the Experience section in <a href="http://glasscutters.org/GLASS.pdf" rel="nofollow">GLASS</a>, for a variety of ways to constrain advancement or out-right eliminate it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200110/#Comment_200110" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T10:00:39+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 10:00AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like advancement.

Numbers can go up but, because of the way stats interact, this doesn't really represent the character "improving" just changing.<br/>Agora might be a poor example, I'm not sure.  It's competitive.  characters can definitely gain more power (and lose it), but they do so in a more organic way, by struggling with the other player characters over resources and opportunities.  so it's very different from a game in which you're handed experience points after every session or battle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200113/#Comment_200113" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T10:06:04+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 10:06AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2009 10:09AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NPC</cite>How does a character "sort of get better" in that system?</blockquote>\nThe game's freely available; <a href="http://crngames.com/the_shadow_of_yesterday/" rel="nofollow">you should check it out.  </a>  Characters get better by doing things their players have flagged as fun, challenging, or interesting to them.

I couldn't say it was grounded at all.<br/>I remember a game of Amber we played in which we'd discovered that we were Amberites. I wanted to build up slowly through developing my powers and the whole emotional trip, some people wanted to go straight to blasting chaos and world building. Guess which won out.<br/><br/>I'm pretty happy with little to know changes in a characters abilities but I do like to see changes around them, so snippets of information rather than numbers, relationships, etc. We had pretty much no advancement in a game of Over the Edge I ran, but I did hand out character cards from the On the Edge card game as contacts which gave the players a neat way of visualising change.<br/><br/>I don't think advancement is necessary, but change is, whether external to the character or internal and there are many ways of managing this but I think the first thing to do is check that your group is happy with this idea.

Otherwise, why bother making it long-term in the first place?<br/><br/>But I also like advancement, for several reasons:<br/><br/>- There are plenty of games where character creation limits how competent a PC can be at the outset, and that frequently makes long-term goals seem ridiculous without advancement.  I can make a character who <i>wants</i> to be king of the world, but if he starts off barely qualified to run a Dairy Queen and cannot improve his skills significantly, then he comes off as delusional and sad rather than ambitious.<br/><br/>- In new or unfamiliar systems, advancement gives a handy way to ease into things.  Learning a new trick every other session gives you time to familiarize yourself with them and really understand how they work in a way that isn't true when you sit down in the first session and have forty tricks at your disposal right away.<br/><br/>- Advancement is one of the things that I can play with when we're not playing the game.  We get together on Saturday, we have a good time, it's awesome; then on Tuesday over lunch I can idly skim the game book on my own and think "What would be a good choice for spending those XPs?"  The fact is, advancement is <i>fun</i>.  It's fun to do, it's fun to think about.<br/><br/>- Advancement lets me fix my mistakes organically and make a story out of that.  We start playing a game, and up until the first session I think "This character's going to be awesome to play."  Then I find out that no, he isn't.  He doesn't quite fit the game, or the thing that I thought we were going to do a lot of turns out to practically never happen, or the thing I thought he would never have to do is the thing he ends up doing all the damn time.  And I could turn around and say, "Okay, screw this character, I'll just make a new one," but what if we went to some effort at the start of the game tying all the PCs together?  Now it's not only my own work that's been wasted, it's the work everyone did, and that's not cool.  But if there's a chance that I can have fun playing the guy who starts off in over his head but eventually learns the ropes, I can do that without having to make a big deal out of it.  Just funnel all those advancement points into learning to be a fighter rather than a lover, or whatever.<br/><br/>- Advancement lets the game itself change, for the same reasons.  We could bop around solving crimes for the FBI or what have you, and then transition into running our own detective agency following up on paranormal experiences, and then turn to charitable work to improve our hometown, and all the time keep the same characters without having to do periodic major rewrites ("okay, so she was a fingerprinting expert, but in this scenario she'll need to know how to exorcise demons, and in the next one she'll need to be able to hang drywall...").  Instead we can all fit ourselves into new niches as we go along -- learn on-the-job, as it were.<br/><br/><br/>...which I guess puts me in the skeptical "I don't know what other rewards you can offer to make up for no advancement" camp.  You can do one-step-forward-one-step-back advancement, where people can get better at some things at the cost of getting worse at others, but that's obviously not a perfect solution for anything.  You can offer more ethereal types of advancement (more friends, more history, etc.), but that doesn't hit all the right notes, either.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm more familiar with no advancement in short-term games.  There, it's not a big deal; you can have everyone start out with mad skills and unholy power if you want to do a "let's take over the world" scenario.  You can stick with systems that everyone knows well so that no one has to be eased into anything.  You can make sure that the characters fit in with what the game is about and not have to worry about how things might change.  But that's not where the appeal of a long-term game is, I think, and I don't know what can be used to fill the gap there.<br/><br/>It's an interesting question.  If it IS taboo to take advancement out of long-term games, maybe it's for a good reason?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200133/#Comment_200133" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T11:29:31+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 11:29AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with David A.

Call of Cthulhu comes to mind, with the ever-diminishing SAN score.  Also, some games that support a kind of "tragic warrior eventually brought down by the weight of the world" motif -- Burning Wheel, Riddle of Steel, and Warhammer Fantasy come to mind -- have the character taking on more and more penalties as the game progresses, such that they are eventually not able to heal them all.  It's like getting to the high levels of Tetris, basically, where blocks start coming faster than you can get rid of them.  As such, even if your abilities increase, you still have this weakening process occurring at the same time, which may eventually kill you.<br/><br/>Also, freeform games have been going on forever without any mechanical changes or advancement.  My sense of those is that the players become invested directly in the fiction and characters, skipping any investment in the mechanics or becoming mechanically superior, and so are chomping at the bit to continue finding out what happens -- as if they were watching their favorite TV series -- without any mechanical reinforcement.  But if you have a fiction and characters that really aren't that gripping, where the players are mostly invested in their own PC and becoming more badass, then that might not work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200205/#Comment_200205" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T15:39:03+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  3:39PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Also, some games that support a kind of "tragic warrior eventually brought down by the weight of the world" motif -- Burning Wheel, Riddle of Steel, and Warhammer Fantasy come to mind -- have the character taking on more and more penalties as the game progresses, such that they are eventually not able to heal them all. </blockquote>\nJonathan, do you mean short-term BW, TRoS and Warhammer?

I find I need to feel that accomplishments are measurable somehow. Achievement in the fiction is better for me than mechanical advantages, but if you can tie them together, that's even better. Second, for a long-term game to be successful, it really really helps when new stuff comes into play. This is as easily achieved by gaining new powers as it is by accumulating wounds, penalties, scars, and disadvantages--either way, the challenges you face and the options available to you are changing over time.<br/><br/>Reward can also be had through the revelation of information ("I learned what X meant, and now that's a piece of information I can use to achieve goal Y") or the discovery of new things to explore and play with (for instance, moving on to explore a new world or country, discovering a new species, facing a new enemy).<br/><br/>I'd say you need some form of reward and change in a long term game.

I really like the idea of, you know, starting as this guy who's kind of a schmuch, but who's going to go out and, well, <i>adventure</i>.  He was raised on a farm, or maybe he was the son of a blacksmith.  Whatever.  He's a pretty tough kid, but he doesn't really know what he's doing yet.  So he's got his hands full fighting a a few kobolds or goblins with his other ambitious loser friends.  It's tough, but they manage.  It's a challenge, and they rise to it.  They don't always win, but they survive, and they <i>learn</i>.  They <i>grow</i>.<br/>And as they continue to survive, they get better.  As time goes on kicking the crap out of kobolds gets to be <i>easy</i> and now they're fighting trolls.<br/>Rinse and repeat, eventually they're killing dragons, saving princesses, and being crowned king out of sheer heroic badassedness.<br/><br/>Note that I said I like the <i>idea</i> of this.  In actual practice, this kind of plotline often seems to be more trouble than it's worth.  But I really like the idea of a group of "heroes" that aren't that great at first but become good.  Or even if they're totally big awesome warriors from the get-go (at least compared to the normal peasantry) they get better.<br/><br/>But not all games do it.<br/>I mean, it's another game I haven't actually played, but look at Prime Time Adventures.  One of the suggested season lengths is 9 episodes, right?  9 episodes plus a pitch session and/or a pilot session makes 10 or 11.  That's, well, I mean it's not a multi-year mega-campaign, but it ain't short.  And character's aren't exactly improving mechanically, except in the sense that I guess some people might be building up a bit of a stock pile of fan mail, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200319/#Comment_200319" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T05:31:15+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  5:31AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2009 5:31AM by J_Walton.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Jonathan, do you mean short-term BW, TRoS and Warhammer?

In other words, if they roleplay to enjoy one-upping each other in power fantasies, then any game that is not about one-upping each other in a power fantasy is going to fall flat.<br/><br/>But before all of that, I think the best route for you is to articulate what sort of game experience you hope to design.  Don't worry about techniques (which is different from playing with ideas \u2014 just don't <em>worry</em> about it) until you know what your game is supposed to do.

At that point, mechanical advancement and world advancement go from shyly looking at each other in the hallways to madly groping each other under the bleachers.<br/><br/>I mean, yeah, a party of adventurers in D&amp;D is always going up against level-appropriate challenges, so getting new spells or a bump in attack bonus or a cooler sword just means they're keeping pace with the new beasties they're fighting.  All gains in power and effectiveness are balanced out by how much more powerful and effective their opponents are.  But in the context of the setting, the characters know that the stuff that made them pee their pants back when they were callow level 1 novices with nothing but cheap weapons, fifty feet of rope, and a 10' pole -- like, say, a gang of trolls -- are now something that they could slap down easily if they ever had to.<br/><br/>Not that they will, since their days will be filled with dragons or liches or Demogorgon or what have you, but that's sort of the point: mechanically, the advantages of leveling up mean less in a traditional D&amp;D game than the perception of advancement with respect to the setting does.  Being bad enough dudes to treat trolls as a minor annoyance <i>even when you don't actually meet any more trolls</i> is cool.  It can change who your characters are with respect to the game world, the same way that getting a title or a castle or a wicked-looking scar would.  It's not an either/or deal, it's a package: you get the new mechanical toys and expanded challenges AND the new position/reputation within the gameworld all at once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200562/#Comment_200562" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T03:59:48+00:00" title="April  4, 2009  3:59AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember that Underworld had a system whereby you changed the world with your actions.  Each neighbourhood had ratings in several areas and if you, say, robbed a bank and gave the money out to the poor it would raise that neighbourhood's wealth but at the cost of lowering its employment rate (as people had enough money to not have to take shitty jobs).  I seem to remember that you never came out ahead, effectively suggesting that any kind of social engineering was impossible.<br/><br/>My problem with D&amp;D is that the advancement is illusory.  Yes you get more power and better weapons but the opposition is much tougher too so you still spend the same amount of time out of a game session having to fight stuff.  If having more power meant being able to basically get out of having to do combat then the desire to accumulate power would make sense to me but I've always felt that D&amp;D is a game about the rat race.  It's like getting a better job with more pay but you never really focus on the stuff you do outside of work so sure you have a bigger office and more people suck up to you but guess what?  You're still spending 10 hours a day doing something you feel the need to take regular holidays from.  If anything, more power in a D&amp;D game is a draw-back as instead of having an easier time of it, the more powerful you become the more you have to start juggling powers and buffs and spells and bearing in mind tactics for killing things.  In fact, thinking about it, advancement in D&amp;D only makes sense if tactical engagement is what you want out of the game.  So you fight more in order to have to make more tactical choices.  Bleh... no wonder I never enjoy playing that game.<br/><br/>The problem is that I've yet to encounter a game with a more attractive model for long-term play.<br/><br/>Most games are just less honest about their mode of advancement.  So you keep playing, you keep earning XPs but after a while it takes longer and longer between stat bumps.  There's no fundamental difference between that and D&amp;D it's just that whereas D&amp;D is the guy who goes "booyah!  Another pay rise!" most games simply smile quietly to themselves and go out for dinner a little more often.<br/><br/>I think character change is a much more interesting way of dealing with stuff but the problem is that most players expect advancement to be about becoming better.  If you played a game and at the end of it the GM suggested you pick up a new phobia most players would rage against GM interference and how unfair it was that after playing all of these sessions you'd be penalised etc etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200585/#Comment_200585" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-04T09:38:48+00:00" title="April  4, 2009  9:38AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I donno, I would still send wuss goblins up against the 10th level party expressly for the reason that they could now kick them halfway across the continent and that is fucking great.<br/><br/>I think the advancement in D&amp;D, even when people don't do this, is in other parts of the setting.

It's obviously important narratively, and it's important for the game aspect as well - players will have mments when they think "Hmm, my character isn't very good at what we're trying to do now" and will want to make decisions that alter that fact in the future. "Levelling up" is the most straightforward way to do this, and it's not purely illusory - if there are tasks in the rules that have set difficulty benchmarks (climbing a wall, swimming in armour, making some fantastic new armour to replce the stuff you had to shed in the middle of a lake) then players will notice the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also an issue of verisimulitude - in the real world people do learn how to do new things or get better at their existing skills. It's weird if this is impossible in a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I don't think that it's <i>necessary </i>for characters to get ever more powerful with no corresponding drawbacks. After all, in the real world there is <i>some </i>value to being young and energetic - octogenarians aren't the most capable people on the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could design a game in which players can "cash in" attribute points for XP that can be spent on skills. The exchange rate on this could be rather favourable (cashing in one point of an attribute allows you enough XP to buy several points of skills), and indeed, there could be attributes that exist purely for the sake of being cashed in. If characters have attributes like Naivety as well as purely positive attributes like Strength and Memory, then the players will start by reducing their Naivety to pay for skills that they want. Eventually, however, all of the negative attributes will be gone, and then the player will have to start sacrificing Memory or Health - showing the inevitable decline of middle and old age. You could even cash in unusuaed skills to show how some abilities are simply lost if unusued. Combined with a reasonable limit on how much you can cash in at once, and how fast you can acquire new skill points, I think it would be pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be a neat way to handle experience and learning in a game that uses a lifepath for character generation, or a "random but equal" chargen like REIGN's one-roll character creation.

What would that game be like?</blockquote>\nAt the risk of talking about something I know nothing about (since I hesitate to describe any of my past play experience as "long-term campaigning"), I would actually guess that most <i>successful</i> long-term play already works like this... kinda. What I mean is, when I listen to people talk about their (successful) long-term play, the thing they always seem to talk about is the slow build of relationships, setting details, and history, as well as their characters' ever deepening involvement in all that. While they still mechanically advance, I would guess that the mechanical change is really a secondary priority.<br/><br/>So I would guess that the type of game you're asking about would actually look very, very similar to (successful) traditional long-term campaigning.<br/><br/>PS---I will also re-iterate Jonathon's point that, like, all freeform already works without "mechanical" advancement. Just look into that if you're really curious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200857/#Comment_200857" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T06:26:40+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  6:26AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Sufficiently Advanced there's virtually no character improvement, with the exception of learning skills over time.

You could even play an existing system and just strip the experience points or equivalent out of it, so long as you and your players still found a reason to come back to the table every week.<br/><br/>Let's say, hypothetically, I'm running some kind of game that's similar to <i>Ars Magica</i>, but without the experience system. There's still a lot of things the players can do that will keep them coming back, even without any mechanical change on their character sheet. They can research new spells, write grimoires, teach apprentices, have magical duels with neighbouring Covenants, make magical artifacts, negotiate trade with the Fair Folk, slay dragons to collect Tass, resist bullying from the local lord... and as long as the players see the accomplishment of the -goal- as something that's as important as "buying the next level of Rego magic", then they don't really need an advancement system.<br/><br/>Experiment: At the start of the first session, hand out an index card to each player. Play the game as normal, and try and suss out what each character is doing and why. At the end of the session, have the player write one concrete goal, short- or long-term for their character on the card, and hand the card back to you.<br/><br/>Run your next session in such a way that all the players have a chance to forward their character's goals. When a player feels that the goal is complete, then give them a big red pen and let them write COMPLETE on the goal card. Then give them two more blank ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_201171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201171/#Comment_201171" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T15:31:32+00:00" title="April  7, 2009  3:31PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You got it, Adam!
