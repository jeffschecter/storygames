And we were talking about some indie/story game, kind of like this: "Boy, that's a <i>weird</i> game. Who the hell came up with that?"<br/><br/>And it got me thinking that there have been some pretty bizarre games created within this community (or at the Forge). Bizarre concepts, bizarre mechanics, weird implications about life, the universe, and everything.<br/><br/>What's the weirdest indie/story game* you know?

I admire this myself, I just wish I could pick apart my own motivations and interests to cut away the cruft and only bring out the personal vision from among the genre cliches. There's probably no other game designer who expresses himself and his life experience so consistently directly in his design. Leads to all sorts of weirdness from the audience perspective, of course.<br/><br/>On my own list of indie weirdness, however, one game reigns supreme: <i>Multiverser</i> is an intriguing, challenging, philosophical, ambitious work that makes "heavy" games like Rolemaster piss their pants with the sheer amount of crunch. The game is ideological, evocative and straight out exceptional in all the weirdness it drags out. It is also nigh unplayable by the book (an important qualification, as I understand that many people have managed to play the game with a traditional GM-fiated method), but I don't care, as it's too interesting to ignore. Among other things the game involves a chararacter generation system based on simulating the player's own abilities, an insane multiverse ruled by the God of Abraham, creating a new game setting from scratch for every session, having the player characters never meet each other and so many other weird things that the game really can only be characterized as ground-breaking.<br/><br/>Other than that, it seems to me that "weird" mostly means games where I don't understand the context of the game's creation and thus don't understand why it ticks the way it does. In this regard Engle Matrix games are "weird" - I don't have the life and scene experience informing the design and thought processes behind them, so they seem exotic and weird, somewhat like <i>Multiverser</i>, only less insane.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Not only non-pulp adventure themed games were rare, but daring to touch the subject of mental illness was really courageous. I had fun playing a session of it as far as I remember but the system didn't look like it was helping the GM in building/exploring interesting patient scenarii. I felt very free form and, since we didn't have a grasp on shared narrative control back then, it was a heavy heavy task for the GM.<br/><br/>Another game dealing with mental illness I wanted to get is <a href="http://eastenwest.free.fr/?type=articles&amp;ID=226" rel="nofollow">Hystoire de Fou</a> by Denis Gerfaud. From the descriptions I read it reminds me of DRYH: reality gets warped and characters enter a world of madness. The rules seem to portray disbelieving hallucinations, or shaping them, also two types of madness (paranoia and schizophrenia) but I don't know any detail. PCs are assumed to want to escape from the dementia crisis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254994/#Comment_254994" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T08:15:10+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  8:15AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Armed cryptomormon moralists wandering the American West = weird.</blockquote>Yeah, that too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255108/#Comment_255108" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T17:04:10+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  5:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some great examples of games based on weird (fictional) conceits.<br/><br/>What about games that are indescribably weird in terms of gameplay and mechanics?

You've traveled to England to watch a game, and it's been a dull match, ending in a tie. You play for 15 minutes exactly. Shit, I'm just going to type up the whole "The Game" segment, since it's so short, and shows how weird this game is.<br/><br/><b>The Game.</b><br/>The whole game takes place at a pub<br/>after the match. You play out the talk<br/>around the table, commenting on the match,<br/>reminiscing about legendary matches,<br/>talking about the weather, the hotel,<br/>domestic affairs and any details you may<br/>contrive to make part of the character's<br/>life. Try to engage in your character and <br/>his/her relations to the other characters,<br/>and to <i>be a dull person with a dull life</i>. (emphasis mine)<br/><br/>The relations between the characters<br/>are improvised. If someone implies that<br/>they are married to your character, then<br/>they are. If someone talks about a joint<br/>experience, then you have experienced it.<br/>Go along with the ideas of other players,<br/>but keep it down-to-earth.<br/><br/>Do not under any cirumstances make<br/>any strange or exciting remarks. Be<br/>ordinary. Let silence speak if you find<br/>nothing to say. 15 minutes can be a very<br/>long time in a dull life.

It's reverse-engineered from text adventures, and lists a set of actions for each of the two characters, not unlike the statements in <i>Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</i>, and tells the story of an awkward meeting between two people. The actions are determined by location and circumstances, so that, for instance, you cannot say "...sets down the bucket" unless you've already said, "picks up the bucket". The tree of statements make up the entirety of rules of play (almost), so that the story is more or less set, and the players just navigate it through it in different ways. Like <i>Kazekami</i>, there is no GM and no "mechanics" such as seen in most RPGs. The end of the story is scripted, but I get the impression that each run through the game might colour that ending in different shades for the players.<br/><br/><i>If that link is some kind of pirate/illicit source that shouldn't be there, let me know and I'll remove it.

I mean, when I first heard of paranoia and Toon, they were <i>weird</i>. Like, "haha you can't do that in an RPG can you Oh, you can??" weird. When I first bought Over the Edge, like 12 years ago, it was <i>weird</i>--not only the paranoid drug-trip of a setting, but the minimalist mechanics with no fixed attributes or skill list or anything (both of which weirdnesses I loved instantly, by the way). Now, looking back, it's as "normal" as apple pie next to a lot of the games that followed in its footsteps--even Sorcerer, which has a lot of the classic RPG components firmly in place, if tweaked and repurposed. And now I've been exposed to a multiplicity of games with a wide variety of approaches. So I'm hard-pressed to find a game I think is genuinely "weird."<br/><br/>KKKKK mentioned above is "weird" to me, though in a way I like and want to try. Polaris is "weird" I guess, with its structuring the mechanics as explicit negotiation. The subject matter is poetic and aesthetically focused, but not weird <i>per se</i>. Bacchanal is weird in its structure, with the different influences of the gods jumping around between wine glasses, then "spilling out" not to resolve anything but to show which divine influence dominates the narration. Its subject matter is daring, for sure, but hardly weird. it's more mainstream than the "D&amp;D Fantasy" genre, for example.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_255868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255868/#Comment_255868" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T23:51:58+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 11:51PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 11:55PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jaywalt</cite>But why would Finnish fans choose to root for Stoke City of all places?

I concur!<br/><br/>My first game of <i>Stoke-Birmingham 0-0</i> was a revelation.

It's just that I can imagine what would happen if I tried to introduce the game to... well, pretty much every gaming group I've ever been a part of, really. They look at me oddly enough when I suggest "Don't Rest Your Head" or "Mouse Guard". Gamers around here aren't generally the highbrow, artsy type who want to explore their innermost feelings through the medium.

It's not all that weird - the scenario might be a little bit weird, but it's still definitely within the purview of modern cyberpunk. Also, scenarios for any game can be weirdly specific, and this is definitely a scenario more than a specific game. The system material is minimal, as the game belongs in the local immersionist paradigm - GM-controlled freeform, essentially. The game's art is in line with its subject matter.<br/><br/>An addition for Finns who read this and will read more into it than they should: as I've said before, I think that T\xe4hti is a fine scenario, and I appreciate its topic and treatment even if I don't consider its efforts at rpg system design to amount to much. The relative lack of weirdness I argue for here is not an indictment of the work's quality.<br/><br/>(The Finnish scene is small, you can imagine that anything I say about my peers here will be read with a magnifying glass by somebody.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256139/#Comment_256139" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T09:44:01+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  9:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>I'm glad you said that.

For those of us who don't know those games.<br/><br/>I think Mendel was working on some game where, instead of resolution within the fiction (which was handled freeform), players maneuvered their characters so they could later play cards in their hand (which listed things like "X and Y become friends"), and thus the competition was between the players, with all in-fiction differences being handled totally narratively. That sounded interesting, and very unusual for RPG territory, but it could be my fevered imagination reconstructing something else I heard somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256148/#Comment_256148" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T10:22:28+00:00" title="February 11, 2010 10:22AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bow to Eero's Finnish literacy regarding content.

There are actually two games you could be talking about. Most likely you are thinking about <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/RPGs/FaustnFriends.pdf" rel="nofollow">Faust and Friends</a>, the relationship game about selling your soul which was my 2007 Game Chef entry. I explicitly mentioned how the relationship card mechanic is the core of the game, and how everything else is really just a way to gain credibility with the other players that these two characters actually have the relationship you want them to have - because by design those two levels don't interact except through the fiction. <br/><br/>On the other hand, half the reason I wrote Faust and Friends was to kick myself into fixing some playtest problems in my original game which has much the same structure in a somewhat different context, not soapy college kid's who sell their souls, but crazy shoujo anime relationship chaos in <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/playtest/PureShoujo_v1_5.pdf" rel="nofollow">Pure Shoujo</a>. <br/><br/>Although I find it interesting that these are <i>weird</i> games.

Have you got any weirder ones?</blockquote>\nWell one, that comes to mind thanks to Ash's mention earlier of the <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/reversed.html" rel="nofollow">Reverse Engineering</a> contest is <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/TitleGoesHereMendel%20Schmiedekamp.pdf" rel="nofollow">Title Goes Here</a>. The short blurb is you create your own alternate mysticism - like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah" rel="nofollow">Kaballah</a>. <br/><br/>More broadly the group chooses a great work (which need not be great or even known well by the players), and you play the roles of scholars plumbing its depths, the characters within the work, and the truths within the work. The resolution mechanic is a combination of codes and changing your role (from say, scholar to character). As resolution occurs, you chart a map, showing the secret truth within the great work. <br/><br/>So you could, for example, actually play this game for Harry Potter: the Philosopher's Stone (which you've all read) or a made up version of Finnegans Wake (which none of you ever have). And then wonder how much of your map you should take seriously. Sure, I designed it (except for the character sheet), but this game actually does weird me out more than a bit. And it certainly meets my Christmas Ninjas test. <br/><br/>As for others, I'm sure I have a few that stand out. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_256504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256504/#Comment_256504" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T16:22:09+00:00" title="February 13, 2010  4:22PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2010 4:22PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>Is there actually such a thing as a normal indie RPG anyway? </blockquote>To be playing rpg's is weird.<br/><br/>To <i>design </i>them is waaay out there.<br/><br/>Still; doing all these weird things may give you the tools to build a beautifully sound character ... ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256844/#Comment_256844" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T14:13:06+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  2:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Jeff Himmelman's "Kingdom of Nothing"</blockquote>That's very likely--he's got a LOT of LARP experience.
