<p>Over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=456&amp;page=1#Item_96" rel="nofollow">Ready Made Out of the Box</a> JDCorley is making an interesting point ... that (given the Lumpley Principle) it's not so easy as you might think to separate questions like "Are you changing the actual written rules of the game?" from questions like "Are you defining the situation?"  They are, after all, all part and parcel of the overall Lumpley System.</p>
<p>Two examples that spoke to genuinely got me thinking were this:  Town Creation in DitV is a definition of the specific scope of things that will be examined in an episode.  How do you differentiate the way <em>that</em> impacts what moral issues you can engage with from (for instance) changing the Escalation sequence, which also impacts the moral issues you can engage with?  Second, if you change the rules of D&amp;D so that certain attacks aren't as prominent, is that as big a change as setting the game in a court intrigue setting where <em>combat as a whole</em> will be less prominent?</p>
<p>Cool stuff.  I don't think the classic "But it's written down in the rule-book" answer is a clear-cut difference, precisely because of the aforementioned Lumpley Principle.  In other words, what I thought I knew turns out to be just me not having thought things through.  Awkward!</p>
<p>But here's the thing:  I think that it's possible that these things are different ... but not on the question of whether they're written in the rule-book.  I'm going to tackle the Dogs example and then see how the D&amp;D one looks after I've rambled a bit.</p>
<p>Town Creation in Dogs sets <em>initial conditions</em> for the game.  It sets up the people who are present, the questions that are going to be asked.  It doesn't establish the answers the players are going to give, and more to the current point it doesn't establish the <em>procedures</em> that those players are going to follow in creating those answers.</p>
<p>Now the rules of Dogs are going to create some emergent patterns <em>no matter what initial conditions are first fed into them</em>.  For instance, my experience is that there will be escalation to physical violence between Dogs ... that one side of that will escalate to gunplay, and the opposing side will ratchet back down to Just Talking, and that the fallout from that conflict will go into d4 relationships between the two principles.  Now that's pretty ludicrously specific (though if it sounds familiar to you then I want extra points!) but I do feel that if we abstracted everyone's experience we could see the more general emergent patterns that DitV rules create, irrespective of the starting conditions.</p>
<p>I mentioned that I was going to ramble, right?</p>
<p>So I think I've led up to the distinction I see, yes?  There is a distinction between running through Town Creation and changing the mechanics of Dogs.  In the one case you're changing the initial conditions, in the other case you're changing the rules that create the emergent patterns.</p>
<p>Now ... is this the <em>same</em> thing in D&amp;D?  I actually think <strong>no</strong>, it's not.  Again, this is just off-the-cuff talk from my personal experience, but I don't think that the parts of the system that create emergent patterns are housed in the game mechanics for D&amp;D.  A great deal of what carries forward from one scene to the next is created entirely by group fiat, and so anything that directly influences that group fiat is going to have a powerful effect on emergent properties of the game.</p>
<p>In Dogs, for instance, it doesn't <em>matter</em> whether the group all thinks the Steward is well-respected by the townsfolk.  If a Dog wins stakes of "Humiliate the Steward" then that Steward is humiliated, and next scene he's <em>still</em> humiliated, and frankly he's gonna be pretty well humiliated until somebody goes in by the rules and gives him his dignity back.</p>
<p>But if you're playing a Court Intrigue game in D&amp;D, and somebody somehow humiliates the king (not even sure what you'd roll for that, but anyway ...) there's absolutely nothing that even <em>implies</em> that the king should stay humiliated, or that there should be any great consequences from that action.  Indeed, the group fiat might say "Hey, if this were a dungeon then yeah, we'd have killed him and that would stick ... but the situation is court intrigue, so no matter what happens the king is going to retain his dignity."</p>
<p>See right there?  That clever bit where I "proved" that the situation of the Court Intrigue would change the emergent properties, just by writing an example where it does?  Sounds plausible, doesn't it?  Shame it isn't actually an argument.  It's just a plausible example.</p>
<p>The argument would be something like this:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>In a game where emergent patterns are created by explicit rules (e.g. DitV) the situation is just an initial condition, because it's impact into the explicit rules happens once ... after that the new conditions created by the explicit rules override the original conditions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>By contrast, in a game where emergent patterns are created by implicit rules and social feedback (e.g. D&amp;D) the situation has a powerful impact upon emergent properties, because it impacts the implicit rules over and over ... as people decide in their own heads what the outcome should be they refer back to the initial situation as a road-map to understanding the goals of the group as a whole.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Wow.  I wonder if this is my longest post ever on this board.  I guess JDCorley really <em>did</em> inspire me to some thinking.  My brain hurts a little.  Also, it's late.  So maybe I'm just babbling.</p>
<p>What do <em>you</em> think?</p>

                            I think you need to work on that argument a little more, I know you're on to something but I don't know what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree that there is a difference between cooking up a town in Dogs in the Vineyard and cooking up a dungeon in D&amp;D and cooking up a Nazi moonmen plot in Adventure!.  We all know there is a difference.  But over time I've come to believe that the difference is not very important - if it is important at all.<br/>
<br/>
Even what you describe as "emergent" patterns from Dogs does not restrict in the slightest the kind of behavior you describe as being, um, something else in D&amp;D.  The reason is because it's on the social level and as much as I think the Big Model is a waste of time, it's dead-on correct that the social level trumps everything below it.<br/>
<br/>
Why does the Steward stay humiliated? Well, because we decided to use that rule in the book that says he does. <br/>
<br/>
Why do I get an extra poke with my +2 rapier at the dingus who just tried to run past me? Well, because we decided to use that rule in the book that says I do.  <br/>
<br/>
"Hey, let's play a game where you don't get that extra poke with your +2 rapier, I think it would be cool for reasons X, Y and Z." "Aw man, that's a bitchin' idea, we are so much smarter than that game designer." "Or we just know what's better for our group." "Well, sure, but I like saying we're smarter anyway."<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, let's play a game where the Steward might not stay humiliated." "That's a rad idea, we will be indie from the indie people!! That's like twice as rebellious and we'll get twice as many girls to play with us." "But we're both girls already." "But I'm a lesbian, did I not ever mention that to you?" "Uh, no. Huh."<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna try to use something other than D&amp;D from now on, I liked Andy's suggestion in that other thread, which I read as I was preparing this. Everyone comes to the table with a lot of baggage about it, it seems like. 800 pound gorillas can be heavy.  There are plenty of other stand-ins. Hit locations in GURPS! That's perfect.                        </div>

                            Hmmm.  Tony, I mostly strongly agree with what you're saying - except I think that if you dig into it further, there's a distinction between emergent system (for example, escalation and de-escalation in a <i>Dogs</i> conflict) and emergent story.  There's emergent system in most games that I've played, and following the rules is gonna get you there, no argument.  Emergent story is more complicated, because it sounds like you're talking about how players and GMs reason about the fictional world of the game, and how closely they're bound by the mechanics which constrain the story.<br/><br/>I'm not sure your examples of the humiliation of the Steward and, to take it away from D&amp;D, the humiliation of the local Prince in Vampire are actually all that different, except for two things.  First, <i>Dogs</i> explicitly enforces narrative continuity between scenes, as once stakes have been won, they can't be un-staked without explicitly undermining them.  (Though I'm not even sure that's entirely accurate for the way all groups play; I'll have to check to see whether that's actually stated in the rules!)  Second, the point at which the group decides whether the Steward is humiliate-able is when they agree that those are acceptable stakes for the conflict.  You're sort of comparing apples to oranges, because there's no such explicit group agreement for humiliating a Prince.<br/><br/>(If Vampire is a 500 pound gorilla to D&amp;D's 800 pounds, I can find another example, by the way - but that's what I played in college, so I know it pretty well.)<br/><br/>In any case, Tony, I actually think that I agree with you despite disagreeing with your example of narrative emergence.  Games do encourage particular kinds of stories and of narrative reasoning.  Every game has an unstated notion of what is plausible, possible and reasonable, which is encoded both in rules and setting.  <i>Vampire</i> and <i>Dogs</i> are both games about morality, but they certainly encourage very different scopes of conflict, moral questions, and styles of play.  I'm just not sure that Dogs enforces Steward-humiliation without group consensus any more than Vampire does.                        </div>

<p>Okay, first:  Everyone who kinda agrees with some of my points, but disagrees with others?  HERESY!  Nah, just kidding.  I'm not sure I entirely agree with myself on this.  Thanks for picking at it!</p>
<p>JDCorley:</p>
<p><code>We all know there is a difference. But over time I've come to believe that the difference is not very important - if it is important at all.</code></p>
<p>"Important" is a really odd word to use in this context, and I wonder what it's shorthand for.</p>
<p>The division between initial conditions and emergent patterns is a division that sheds light on some questions, and is meaningless in terms of others.  If we were talking about (say) "Who gets to narrate what?  What sources of authority are relevant?" then I would say that initial vs. emergent sheds no light on that question.  I might even say it's "unimportant", but that's short-hand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we were discussing that question then I would say the difference between situation and rules sheds a <em>lot</em> of light on how people think about the question.</p>
<p>The question (to my mind) that we were peering at is something like "When you go from the platonic notion of a game to the practical instance of actually sitting down and playing with your friends, what do you create?  When do you choose to create exactly in accord with the theoretical construct of the game, and when do you create something the game doesn't direct you to?"</p>
<p>I don't think the dividing the things you create into rules vs. situation sheds a whole lot of light on <em>that</em> question.  I do think that dividing it into starting position vs. emergent patterns sheds a fair amount of light.  Again, I would say in this context that the division is "important", as a shorthand.</p>
<p>I suspect we're on different pages, or perhaps that you haven't yet considered that this question could have been unimportant the past 99 times, but be important now.  Probably just the different pages thing, though.</p>
<p>kleenstar:</p>
<p><code>Every game has an unstated notion of what is plausible, possible and reasonable, which is encoded both in rules and setting.</code></p>
<p>Uh ... no.  Some games have <em>stated</em> notions of what is plausible, possible and reasonable.  <em>Capes</em>, for instance.  If I win "Goal:  Humiliate Major Victory" then he is humiliated.  Period.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I hadn't thought about how the situation impacts what sort of stakes people in Dogs are willing to accept.  It's a bit of a blind-spot for me. I've never had the slightest temptation to resist any stakes that anyone proposed in Dogs.  "I save the whole town, and now everybody's happy," as Stakes?  COOL.  Will you escalate to gunfighting against a five year old child for that?</p>
<p>But yeah, other people deal with that differently.  So I can conceive (at the outer limits of my imagination) of a group that would say "No, 'Humiliate the Steward' is not legitimate stakes."  Interesting.  Maybe the question of what place starting situation has in impacting the rules by which we transition from state X to state X+1 is more of an analog spectrum (with Capes being hard to the edge of 'Situation matters not at all', Dogs occupying a zone over on that end where situation matters very little, and Vampire being way over on the other side with situation mattering a great deal on an ongoing basis).  Food for thought!</p>

<code>&lt;code&gt;Every game has an unstated notion of what is plausible, possible and reasonable, which is encoded both in rules and setting.</code><br/><br/>Uh ... no. Some games have stated notions of what is plausible, possible and reasonable. Capes, for instance. If I win "Goal: Humiliate Major Victory" then he is humiliated. Period.<br/><br/>True, but this isn't quite what I meant.  Some games do state these notions, but not all of them do, and even the ones that do also have unstated notions - even if that notion is "cause and effect" or something that seems equally obvious to us.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that we, as human beings, have to have ways to reason about what might make sense in a story.  Sure, in <i>Capes</i> you can make the Stakes whatever you want - but that doesn't mean that it will actually make sense to the players.  The game (as I've read it - admittedly I've only played once) seems to draw pretty heavily on notions of what a superhero story is about.  This is going to influence the ways that players make sense of what goes on in the story, the kinds of stakes they are willing to set and accept, what actions seem plausible, what will make the group go "CHEESE!" and the like.  Very little of this is encoded directly in the rules, because all that work of narrative reasoning goes on in players' heads.  I'm not disagreeing with you about how games can more and less actively support the Stakes that players introduce, but I do think we're talking about slightly different things.<br/><br/>So, for example, in <i>Dogs</i> it's hard to imagine a group that wouldn't accept Stakes of "Humiliate the Steward" - not just for you, but for me, too.  To me, that's because the Dogs book itself says that the Dogs are the authority, so it's totally reasonable that they could humiliate a Steward.  I would have no problem accepting those Stakes, and I find it hard to imagine a group that would reject them.  In Vampire, though, humiliating the Prince is not an obvious and logical extension of the setting; it may be something the players would like to do, but it's a lot less plausible than humiliating the Steward.  Combined with the lack of clarity in articulating stakes and goals, it would be easy for the GM to overturn or ignore the Prince's humiliation, while doing it for the Steward would be much harder to justify under the particular narrative contract that each game implies.<br/><br/>In other words, while "situation" may or may not have anything to do with the rules of the game, depending on what game it is, it helps us build mental models of what is reasonable in actual play.  These mental models help us make moment-to-moment narrative decisions and judge the narrative decisions of others in ways that have little or nothing to do with the rules, but fall much more under the 'social contract' aspects of play.<br/><br/>Does that make more sense?<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS: Going back to the original post, I think that this ties back into the distinction that Tony was originally making about initial conditions vs. emergent behavior.  Some games are better than others at making people explicitly create this kind of narrative contract, and town creation in <i>Dogs</i> is a part of it.  When you create a town, you're making a concrete version of your mental model - setting up, in particular characters and situations which are both <i>emergent</i> the structure that the game provides (both rules and situation) and are also <i>initial conditions</i> for actual play.  So I think that whether you see something as an initial condition or an emergent pattern depends on where you draw the line, and whose perspective you're looking from: GM, designer, or player.<br/><br/>PPS: How in #<a href="/forums/profile/%24%2A%26amp">@$*&amp;</a>; do you make it quote someone correctly?<br/><br/>PPPS: Thank you, helpful people!                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Excellent thread. I have a question though: What if I don't use the town creation rules in Dogs to create the town? I mean, what if I just set up the town by my own system? Does that change the relationship of the game to initial vs emergent? <br/><br/>I mean... damnit, this isn't clear at all... if Dogs has a system to set up towns (it does) and I do use it, is it different in this process then if I ignore that part of the rules for the game? Or if I use the Dogs system to set up a town in D&amp;D, where the resolution and emergent patterns will work with a very different system?                        </div>

<br/>
To me it just sounds like you're highlighting the difference between situation-addressing conflict resolution and situation-ambivalent task resolution.<br/>
<br/>
In Dogs, the rules impact the situation because that's what they do.<br/>
<br/>
In GURPS (or whatever), the rules impact where you're standing and how much damage you do, because that's what they do.<br/>
<br/>
GURPS does not have any mechanics to determine the significance of position or damage.  Dogs mechanics work almost directly on significance, and position and damage are simply descriptors of significance.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see Situation Creation as being the culprit, here; I see rules that directly manipulate the Situation as being what you're talking about.  It just helps if the Situation is explicitly created before or during play, so you can work on it directly.                        </div>

<p>Brand:  That's a really good question.</p>
<p>DitV's system <em>only</em> reliably creates the emergent properties when it starts from certain initial conditions.  The brilliance of the system is that it also has the Town Creation system, to make sure that you can create an interesting, varied set of towns all of which have the properties required to jump-start the rules.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>(for the mathletes among you, think Mandelbrot set ... a set which is <em>defined</em> as any initial position for which repeated iterations of the mandelbrot formula eventually converge)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I think the <em>biggest</em> rules change you can possibly make in terms of changing the emergent properties of Dogs is to ignore the Town Creation system.  Just read a few pieces of actual play from people who made up the town freeform.  It was enough to convince me.  Maybe it will be enough to convince you.</p>
<p>I ... honestly don't know what this means to the overall point.  It certainly sounds like an <em>even more specific</em> definition of how to separate initial conditions from emergent properties ... some properties only emerge from certain initial conditions.</p>
<p>Whether this thing is <em>true</em> or not, I'm rapidly coming to wonder whether it's usefully true to anyone, or whether it's so overly complicated that it's nothing but an academic (albeit fun) mental exercise.</p>

                            Hey Jess: I suggest using the HTML style (click on the HTML button in the "Format Comments As" right above the "Add your Comments" button, and if you like it set that default in your Account settings) because it's pretty universal.<br/>
<br/>
To do "code blocks", the kind where you see someone's quotes get pulled out with a yellow bar, it's very easy. Just put this around your text:<br/>
<br/>
YOUR TEXT HERE<br/>
<br/>
To do the blocks of text where it gets pulled out and a colored bar added to the left (the color of the color bar depends on the style you chose in your options), use this:<br/>
<br/>
YOUR TEXT HERE<br/>
<br/>
I suggest not using BBCode as much because later, for security reasons, I may have to disable it. There's a flaw or two.                        </div>
