Who knows how many more while I'm not standing right by the door to that room?<br/><br/>What I'm saying here is that it's nearly impossible to get anyone to play a role-playing game, especially one they didn't sign up for months in advance, at Dragon*Con.<br/><br/>Instead, this year Paul Hubbird, Kelley Vanda, Jason Morningstar, Joey Rogers and several others set up an information counter right in open gaming  (down in the basement of the Hilton, which has a much higher traffic share.)<br/><br/>We told people we had games.  We told them to get together, bundle with their friends or just interested strangers, and we would play something great.<br/><br/>And it totally worked.  Our most heard comment was "you need more GMs, cause we want to play something right now and everyone is already busy" and the second most heard comment was "why don't they do this every year?"<br/><br/>The final count is still hazey to me, but there were at least:<br/>Two games of Panty Explosion Perfect<br/>Five games of Fiasco<br/>One game of Vesna Thaw<br/>One game of Zombie Cinema<br/>Two games of Remember Tomorrow<br/>Two games of Lady Blackbird<br/>One game of Dungeon World<br/>One game of Little Fears<br/>One game of SEA DRACULA<br/>One game of Meikyuu Kingdom<br/>...<br/>and someone honestly tried to buy my boxed set of XXXXtreme Street Luge.  I can't make a story like that up.  I mean, I could, but I couldn't live with myself afterwards.<br/><br/>We nearly had a game of...<br/>Monsterhearts<br/>Mist Robed Gate<br/>The Mountain Witch<br/>Durance<br/><br/>Special thanks to Jodi over at Beautiful Brains, without whom we wouldn't have gotten the chance.  She set up a demo table for the products she carries, where people could play some Savage worlds with Clint Black, or maybe some Dragon Age RPG, among others.  Matching people to games as they happened.  And they provided some lovely prize support too.<br/><br/>Also, thank you to Kelley Vanda, for putting together all that signage and the brochures, and for organizing enough character sheets to go around.<br/><br/>Thanks again to Cel*Style and to ndp designs, for sending games! and other promotional material.  It all went home in very eager and grateful hands!<br/><br/>More will come later, as we sort through all the feedback forms.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389285/#Comment_389285" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T06:25:16+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  6:25AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great work!

Beautiful Brains really stepped up to support this initiative. <br/><br/>We definitely could have used twice as many GMs, all the time. <br/><br/>One concern I had, that is worth thinking about, is how to define what "Games on Demand" is going to mean for Dragon Con. Which means defining what a "small press game" is for Dragon Con, I guess, which is of course a semantic rat-hole. But unless you can clearly articulate "this game is OK and this game is not" I worry that it will inevitably become a place for pickup games of the most popular stuff, drowning out small and interesting games.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389309/#Comment_389309" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T10:07:02+00:00" title="September  5, 2012 10:07AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My rule of thumb was "if it's on the schedule, I'm not offering it."<br/><br/>Which was only because Dragon*Con already has some great stuff, and people already had the opportunity to do that through the regular mechanisms.<br/><br/>We did make one exception for a Dungeon World game on Friday, but I stuck to my guns elsewise.  If people showed interest in DW, I pointed them towards Chris's games instead.<br/><br/>I don't think that rule would work at other cons, and I don't expect it to.  I pitched games based on Genre, and Theme, and then told people we would teach the mechanics quickly and not hold that against you.<br/><br/>Personally, I wouldn't mind GMs who wanted to run a game of Shadowrun or Deadlands for a few hours to recruit people through the GoD booth.  It's no skin off my back.  But the rule has got to be "bring three games so people have a choice."

The robots were totally awesome!  (Reminding myself to link a picture here later) We even had one with a My Little Pony reference.  I mean, it's DragonCon after all...<br/>- Gangnam dance worked it's way into the (first) Panty Explosion Perfect game.  The Demon wore a leather coat with a popped collar and ladder shades.  When he saw one of the girls command a clique of ninja-school girls, he snapped his fingers and stole them.  The school-girl ninjas danced their way out of the auditorium with him.  (Reminding myself to link to a picture here later... as the girls spontaneously had ladder shades when the demon's spell took hold)<br/>- Fiasco: L.A. 1936.  We actually had a "plan" build organically from the first round of scenes.  We set that plan up just before the Tilt.  That plan went horribly, embarrassingly messy just after the Tilt roll, and snowballed into the Ending and Aftermath rolls.  It was near formula perfect, without any pre-planning or pre-playing.  It delivered some intense emotional impact, and it taught two players (who had tried it before with less satisfaction) what story-games can really do.<br/>- If I had 6 copies of Panty Explosion, I would have sold 6 copies of Panty Explosion.<br/>- People coming by the booth asking "what are they playing over there?" about Sea Dracula, and then taking a copy for themselves!<br/>- A Zombie Cinema game that had the <i>best</i> middle manager ever, who we all hated, who was the first to die.  The game had a weird, trippy, art-house feel to it in the end, but none of us were sad about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherChris" title="otherChris"><img alt="otherChris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nIBR4SMZLXH6U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherChris">otherChris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389492/#Comment_389492" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T05:26:23+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  5:26AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm the Chris with the scheduled Dungeon World games. When I registered my games, I didn't know this was going to be happening at DragonCon. A major factor in getting me running indie games was Jason Morningstar saying (at DC 2011) the lack of these games at our con was something we had to fix, so I was very happy to see so much work being done to that end (and with his involvement.) I played at and promoted your tables, and I appreciate the people you sent my way.<br/><br/>Next year, I'd like to work more directly with you guys, but I don't know if more GM's at the booth is the only way to expand. The visibility of the GoD booth was outstanding, but the space to play games was surrounded by a crazy amount of traffic, activity, and noise. I loved the game of Panty Explosion Perfect I played in, but I can't help but think it would have been better with a little more time, and a little quieter setting. As odd as the marshalling process can seem the first time you do it, by running DW through the 'traditional' DragonCon channels, I pulled in 2 D&amp;D DM's at the last minute to try my game when their game didn't have enough players.<br/><br/>I want to work more directly with you guys, but I think GoD demo games pointing to scheduled games, and scheduled games pointing to the GoD booth is a better strategy to develop than going all in with the GoD booth. I would also be interested to hear what Paul thought, since he was also using the 'traditional' game marshalling, but in a different way than I was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389497/#Comment_389497" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T06:03:59+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  6:03AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My idea is to get a room to ourselves, ultimately.  We can use two whiteboards.  <br/>One with a header "Available Now."  <br/>One with a header "Now Playing."<br/><br/>We'd still need a greeter/handler.  <br/>We'd still get more traffic/activity during regular muster times.<br/>We would still point people to 4 hour, on the schedule games, when it matched their interest.<br/><br/>But I'd like to maintain the option of shorter, faster, instant games.  A good number of people who came up said that they loved the idea of a game that played out in an hour or so, and couldn't use DragonCon's gaming paths because they didn't know what the Panel or Celebrity schedule was like until two days before the con, and wouldn't waste their time signing up for a game two months in advance, just to cancel it when they found out their Felicia Day panel was in the middle of the game.<br/><br/>Everything you did with and for us throughout the weekend was very much appreciated, and I welcome this and any other feedback you have.  I'll whisper my email to you in a few moments, so feel free to contact me there as well.<br/><br/>Mainly, I'm looking for ways to incentivise GMs to spend a few hours with us.  We got some great people to drop in without compensation, but I think they would have stayed longer if we could offer them something else.  Cool t-shirts, custome "GoD" dice, or other things might work?  I'm just not sure I can offer them badges at this point.  It would be an out-of-pocket expense to me directly.<br/><br/>I loved being able to raffle off the prizes I had, including the donations from Beautiful Brains, ndp, and Cel*Style, and players were very thankful for it too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389506/#Comment_389506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T07:06:24+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  7:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dragon Con's gaming infrastructure seems really calcified and impenetrable to me. Working outside that structure does not seem like a bad move. GoD being almost totally divorced from the scheduled game activities at Gen Con works well, with Gen Con's support. So maybe that's key - approaching Dragon Con and making a case for just giving us a room to handle in the way that best suits our activity and serves the most attendees. It may take a few years before we can make a compelling argument with data but man, the space was there. In the 300 block there was a room that stayed nearly empty 24/7.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389526/#Comment_389526" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T09:21:40+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  9:21AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately, that room is "reserved" for autograph and photo sessions by a different director, totally unrelated to gaming.
