Of the three players, two have given me some of their character info via email; one's given me lots of detail on the five questions, but nothing on their Exhaustion or Madness talents, while the other has sketched out answers to one or two of their questions, but given me pretty clear ideas for both Talents.<br/><br/>For that second player, the Madness Talent in question is the ability to be in more than one place at the same time.  As a bit of lonely fun, I wrote the ability up in the style of Don't Lose Your Mind.\n<blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Two Places at Once</b></span><br/><br/><b>What can i do?</b><br/>You've been so busy for so long -- graduate classes, that prestigious internship, the job you're holding down to pay the rent, tutoring for extra cash to send home for your little brother -- that the people that know you (you don't know that you'd call them friends - you don't really have time to socialize) joke that even if you don't sleep, you'd have to be two places at once most of the time.<br/><br/>They're absolutely right.<br/><br/>While you're working the job, you're doing your term paper at home; while you stay late working on the new research assignment at your intership, you're... well, also working on ANOTHER research assignment for your internship, just somewhere else in the building.<br/><br/>Sometimes your memories get a little... jumbled, and sometimes you lose track of everything you're supposed to be working on, but generally it works out, especially since you started writing yourself reminder notes and leaving them on the fridge or on your computer screen at the office.<br/><br/>The only thing is, the handwriting on those different notes isn't very... similar.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>(1-2 dice)</i></span><br/>Work on two projects at once, as long as neither of them is too difficult and you're nowhere near each other -- sit through a seminar while you're filing old information at one of your jobs.  Alternately (and a little trickier) look up some information you need down in Archives for a meeting you're having Upstairs at the same time.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>(3-4 dice)</i></span><br/>Need to defend yourself?  It's a lot easier when you can kick someone from four different directions at the same time.  <br/>Need to get away?  It's pretty hard for someone to catch you when they (or you) don't know which 'you' to chase.<br/><br/>Need to go into serious research mode?  You're your own team of assistants.<br/><br/><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(5-6 dice)</span></i><br/>Looking for someone or something?  It's a lot easier to find them when you can knock on the door of every single apartment in the whole building at the same time... or when a younger you can look for them two years ago, or an older you can look for them next week.<br/><br/>Fighting back?  You're a one-woman army, with some of you providing the smackdown while others run in with first aid kits and extra hand grenades.<br/><br/><br/><b>How does it break me?</b><br/><br/><i>Fight</i> \u2014 Sometimes, things get to be too much, you know? You just want to hit something -- just hit it and hit it and hit it and hit it until the constant pounding of your fists turned into a drumroll... the beat of raindrops on a tin roof, the fall of a thousand arrows... one pair of fists multiplied a half-dozen, a dozen, a hundred, a thousand times until you're lost in stormy tossed sea of your own anger.<br/><br/><i>Flight</i> \u2014 The danger is too much; even if there were a thousand of you, you'd never be able to face the horror before you and you just need to run -- all of you needs to run, run away, run in as many different directions at once, so that there's no possible way that anyone could catch you... no way they could catch all of you, or even know where you went.  No way anyone could know where each and every one of you went; no way anyone -- even you -- could ever find all of you again.<br/></blockquote>\n<b>How do I change?</b><br/>It's hard to focus, isn't it, when you're do so many different things?  Still, it's double, double, double the brain power; multiplied mental accuity, maybe out to infinity, the way that no other person can be.  You look at the other people around you -- sad little people, trapped in their sad little single-serving lives; only ever able to see through one set of eyes, live one set of days...<br/><br/>... if only there were a way to help them all...<br/><br/><b>What am I becoming?</b><br/>Eventually, you start to feel so bad for all the denizens and nightmares and mortals out there in the world -- there's so much they want, and only one set of hands to make it happen.  You can help them -- you can be everywhere at once, if you really really want to, and every single one of you can solve a problem.<br/><br/>In fact, there's really no way that those pathetic little creatures could ever manage without you -- no way they could know better than you, right?  Two heads are better than one?  Dearie you have NO idea.  They should let you take care of it... take care of them... take care of ALL of them... take care of everything... you know best, you know everything, and they HAD BETTER LISTEN TO YOU.<br/><br/>You are the <b><i>Busybody</i></b>.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Anything I'm missing or cool suggestions for Usage, Breaking, Changes, etc?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187130/#Comment_187130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T09:30:20+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  9:30AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2009 9:30AM by iago.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the general lack of response is because you nailed it, man. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo" title="theloneamigo"><img alt="theloneamigo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/546/n3LSBO7Z43MJI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo">theloneamigo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187324/#Comment_187324" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T19:48:46+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  7:48PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is <i>exactly </i>what a Madness talent should be.
