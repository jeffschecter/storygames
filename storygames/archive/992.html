                    Hey. I hope I am putting this in the right section. I have noticed that there are many published game designers here, and was hoping to gain some wisdom from your guys. Basically, I am noticing that a lot os games tend to be spin-offs of other games and that it seems that it is common for people to take ideas from other games and make them their own. <br/><br/>I was wondering , at what point does a concept become original? <br/><br/>How can one tell when the borrowed ideas that make up their game have been customized enough to be called thier own? <br/><br/>How dose copyright and licensing work with games that are clearly decended from other games? <br/><br/>How does licensing work at all?<br/><br/>For example, in a game that i am working on, I am using a skill pyrimid concept that i first discovered in fate. <br/><br/>Does this mean that i can never publish my game if i use this concept? <br/><br/>Can i publish the game if i give credit to Fate? <br/><br/>If Fate is OGL, and I want my game to be Creative Commons, will there be issues?<br/><br/>I know that this is quite a jumble, but i am having a hard time articulating my question, so i just decided to ask a bunch of questions that seemed related.<br/><br/>Thanks for any help, and please let me know if i should be asking these questions somewhere else,<br/><br/>Charles                </div>

                            Charles,<br/><br/>Do a search at <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a> for Copyright and Trademark. This kind of thing has been discussed a lot over the years.<br/><br/>As I understand those discussions, the copyright is in the text, not the ideas. You can copy ideas from a game and, indeed, many games use mechanics that are clearly derived from other games. For example, you said you enjoyed The Shadow of Yesterday, and that game uses FUDGE dice.<br/><br/>So, as I understand it, the short answer to this question...
<blockquote>For example, in a game that i am working on, I am using a skill pyrimid concept that i first discovered in fate.<br/><br/>Does this mean that i can never publish my game if i use this concept?</blockquote>
...is no. I do hope other people will correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Honestly, I would contact the creators of Fate, and talk to them about it. I am doing a Shadow of Yesterday variant, and even though Clinton put it out under Creative Commons, I wanted to chat with him about what I was doing before I went forward.<br/><br/>Still, basic concepts, like Fan Mail from PTA, can be adapted to new rules like my Mortal Coil without any problem, so long as you aren't cutting and pasting the original description of the mechanic. I think as a basic courtesy, you should acknowledge your original sources. I tried to list all of the games that influenced my design in the thanks section at the beginning of the book.                        </div>

                            Seriously, the Forge publishing forum is a treasure trove of information on these topics.  That's the place for serious discussions of this stuff, in my opinion.  There, and in the office of an IP lawyer. <br/><br/>You can't help being influenced and inspired by prior art in design, though - as long as you aren't, you know, blatantly stealing because you are a lazy ass-hat, you should recognize and thank your sources loudly and often.  There's no shame in saying "I got this from Polaris and Polaris does it better."                        </div>

                            Heh.  Well, quite honestly, I feel that outright theft of ideas is the heart and soul of RPG design.<br/><br/>So in the specific example of Fate (and feel free to treat this as an official response), my thinking is pretty much this:<br/><br/>If you take the text verbatim, then stick to the OGL.<br/><br/>So long as you're just using the idea, but writing your own text, then you're free and clear.  As  courtesy, it would be awesome if you comment somewhere about where you got your inspirations, but that's not a necessity*.<br/><br/>Ultimately, contacting the author is cool and useful because, hey, everyone likes to feel like they've been inspirational, and doubly so when they get soem credit for it.  We're such a cottage industry that people are usually willing to talk about stuff and generally be cool about it. Also, frankly, being cool about it is so much less of a headache than trying to really track down the origins of any particular idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* But man, considering the sheer amount of goodwill that giving credit engenders vs. the annoyance that it's absence generates, taking a sentence to give props is a total gimme.                        </div>

                            Yep. I defianiatly agree with all points. Thanks again for the info. I was in way trying to sugest that i wanted to take other peoples ideas, disguise them as much as possible, and claim that it was my genius that developed them. In fact, I intend to dedecate an entire section on the whole credits thing. I just dont think i would feel ok with things otherwise. Also, I defianitly agree that the simpelst solution is just talking with the game developers. <br/><br/>I guess I keep thinking of big time companies like WotC, and about how alien it seems to me to write them a letter askin if it is ok if i rip off a part of their system, and then publish it creative commons because i like that license better. Heck, I was in shock for months that Rob and Fred actually took the time to answer average guys questions, even somewhat lame questions like mine, over at their yahoo group. I am still setteling in to this cozy indie rpg world (:<br/><br/>I had actually already asked Rob and Fred over at the yahoo group about making  a custom fate, but things just started to drift more from fate after encountering the pool and the shadows of yesterday. So i figured I would simply get a playt testable document together and send it to all of the guys i am taking things from and asking for their ok.  <br/><br/>I guess I just like to be informed as much as possible before making any insulting moves. If it was commonly considered rude, or downright illegal, to borrow ideas from other peoples systems, I would like to know before e-mailing the authors.<br/><br/>You guys are right about the forge being a great resource for these things. I found a great deal of speculation, good advice and some links to the camerican opyright and pattent websites so i could do some research.<br/><br/>Thanks again for the replies!<br/>Charles                        </div>

                            Heh.  You will find that the greatest danger of the Indie community is the frequency of running across awesome ideas and going "Gah! SO cool! Why didn't _I_ think of this! Damn them!".  I am, for the moment, damming Brennan for the brilliance of Mortal Coil, but the damning moves around.

                            Exactly.

                            K, here is what i have come to understand about the whole Originality, Copyright and Licensing thing. <br/><br/>Copyright covers the text itself, or the presenttion of the mechanics so to say. If you use your own words, there should be no issue with copyrights.<br/><br/>Patents could possibly cover game mechanics, but that is as of yet unheard of. So i am gathering that at this time, people do not generaly "own" their game mechanics.<br/><br/>Trademarks are things used to identify the product.  Dont mess with these.<br/><br/>What license your insperational rpgs had only has an effect on the license you can choose if you decided to use exact wording.<br/><br/>A legal consulte is the best, and only sure, way to ensure that you are in the right legaly.<br/><br/>It is a good idea to check with the developers of your barrowed ideas before publishing. It is always better to have consent of the guy who came up with it.<br/><br/>It is good to provide credit for your sources of insperation. It is just plain polite, respectfull and the nice thing to do. <br/><br/>Dose it yound like I have the right idea here? Thanks for the help.<br/><br/>Charles<br/><br/>(Why can i never spell "does" right? I know how to spell it, but when i type it i always get it wrong....)                        </div>

                            As others have said, asking the guy who inspired you is the simplest thing.  <br/><br/>Consulting lawyers is cool and all, but lawyers don't always agree and are expensive.  Finding an IP lawyer who knows about roleplaying at any level beyond "that DnD thing" could take a while and without that you'll also be paying to explain what a roleplaying game is so that he can take a view on whether your treatment infringes anything.<br/><br/>Also, you need a relevantly qualified lawyer.  There are tons of people online who offer legal advice on the basis they did a JD or something.  Avoid them.  Any decent lawyer will caveat his advice as to his qualifications and so on, advice from a guy who isn't practicising or who practices another area of law is valueless.  It has to be an IP lawyer qualified in the relevant jurisdiction.  <br/><br/>Trust me on this, I'm a lawyer (but not appropriately qualified to answer this question in anything other than a layman's capacity, I don't practice IP law).<br/><br/>Edit:  I'd also add that anyone who boasts about their lawschool grades is an amateur, if you've actually been practicing a few years and are doing ok you don't need to talk about what you did at school.  Again, I have seen people do this on rpg fora and it's a clear sign they're not to be taken seriously.                        </div>

                            Balbinus-<br/><br/>Thanks for the tips Balbinus. I never intended to talk with a lawyer (couldn't afford that if i wanted to). I just wanted to make known that i was aware of the fact that the only ways to be sure that one is in the legal right involves legal advice. I would even be wary about gaining the original creators consent unless it was in a way that was totaly legaly binding.  Thats something i wouldnt know how to to, and would prefer to have a profesional verify. Luckily for me, the indie community seems open and friendly and my games are not likely to go beyond my own livingroom, even if published. <br/><br/>However, that is good advice to have in general. I have never needed a lawer, and hope that i never will, but it helps to know what to look for and avoid, especialy when the advice comes from a lawer.<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Charles                        </div>

                            This has been my experience: I'm trying to figure out how to do something in a game. I read or reread a bunch of games and all of a sudden, something clicks (N.B.: this click is usually wrong. It usually takes several attempts to come up with something functional, never mind good). I email the person who wrote the inspiration for the idea and ask them how their mechanic works because I'm trying to do something with it. They tell me and are excited that I'm using their idea. Then I publish a game and someone thinks I'm smart and does the same thing with me, even though I got the idea from someone else.<br/>
<br/>
This is actual cultural transmission, dig. Someone gets excited about what Under the Bed or Shock: <i>does</i>, not "roll and take the highest, ties go to the protagonist player" or "write down a cool thing to use later." Cuz those things? They've grown together from sparkles of brilliance on years of other peoples' experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
If we see further, it's because we're standing on the shoulders of giants standing on the shoulders of giants.                        </div>
