I'm not looking to plagerise but would like to see how other have approached it. <br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration and aid                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181002/#Comment_181002" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T10:06:27+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 10:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be able to help, but I'd need more information.

The Cast of character should grow, Character exploration is on the table as a possible overarching them even if it is otherwise lacking, <br/><br/>The Characters are human and the setting is now, there's some fantasy/sci fi elements thrown in but I want the game to really be more about  the characters and less about what the characters can do. I don't want to get into it more than that, because I want to throw this particular net wide rather than find something right on key. <br/><br/>The game is supposed to be fun in a fairly traditional tabletop rpg, dnd sort of way, but I would also like it to relate to the everyman and day to day life more than the usual ammount of required wish fufillment that dominates tabletop play. <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration. <br/><br/>Logos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181251/#Comment_181251" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T16:27:57+00:00" title="December  2, 2008  4:27PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, good, that helps.  Another question:  you say "fun in a fairly traditional tabletop rpg, dnd sort of way" -- do you mean in the sense of working through adventures requiring resource management, tactical acumen, and puzzle-solving skills?  If so, are these prepared by the GM?

Are there gunfights in dark alleys, coffee shops, and tenement houses?

There's some borderline cases but 4/5 should be in that catagory. <br/><br/>Fighting Crime and Battleing the supernatural are definitely on the table, but I want to angel to fighting the natural and battleing crime? The game is set in the real world and is not married to some kind supernatural mythology (No vampires, No Werewolfs, No Ghosts, Not anything like that, some unexplained and will not be explained sci/fi stuff and then hopefully on with the realism. <br/><br/>I don't see Gunfights in dark alleys, Coffee shops or Tenement houses. Perhaps a few abuductions in broad daylight and more cold warish type stuff. <br/><br/>Hope that Helps, I am actually going to be playing what i got so far tomarrow, so we will see how it goes, I have a few subsystems that certainly seem realistic but lead towards the long road of drimgark and mental breakdown that i'm not sure i want to go down. That said I think you've fairly pegged the genre, Want to make a guess?

One great technique I've come up with is an agenda on a timeline for the threat.<br/><br/>Like, "On day 2,  the sorcerer will poison the Caldwell family's well," "On day 3, the revenant corpse of Jeremiah Caldwell will be sent to murder the sheriff" and so on.  Basically, I make a bulleted list of the threat's agenda, and set dates for it relative to the start of the investigation.  If the players don't figure stuff out fast enough, then bad stuff happens to innocent folks (and possibly the PCs themselves).  Conversely, there's a potential for each point on the agenda to be foiled, if the players are clever enough.  Add onto this that the passage of time is crucial to the regeneration of the PCs' resources to be used in conflicts, and to the preparation (and sometimes performance) of magic.<br/><br/>It seems to work nicely, although it requires some re-planning, sometimes on the spot, on the GM's part when specific plans are foiled but the threat is still in action.  Of course, in multi-session scenarios, that's not as much as an issue, since the GM gets to figure stuff out in the downtime.<br/><br/>Lemme know how the game goes.  And as soon as any other techniques come to mind, I'll let you know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
