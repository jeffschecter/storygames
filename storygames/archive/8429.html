That thread is about setting up a prospective independent game designer booth there, but the convention certainly has room for all sorts of other activities as well.<br/><br/>So I'm just telling you at this time in case anybody else wants to go and meet up there. Plenty of time to make travel arrangements now. And of course, if anybody wants to experience being a booth person, now's a good chance - just like the Gencon Forge booth used to be in the earlier years, this booth is still largely unestablished and needs plenty of workforce that does not have to be actively exhibiting their own stuff. Booth monkeys/ninjas welcome, in other words.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186368/#Comment_186368" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T15:02:12+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  3:02PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I can swing this with other commitments this year, which are considerable, I'd be up for it again. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186396/#Comment_186396" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T16:44:14+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  4:44PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well not particularly, no, but it might be interesting to play something if you get a chance to go. I'm planning to try to arrange for some play time this time around - last time we did Spiel it was mostly work. Having people there purely for fun might help in this regard, as will having more indie rpg people in general.<br/><br/>We'll see how it goes. I'm almost tempted to go even alone (or "alone" with just me and my Arkenstone-specific booth zombies), although having German-fluent allies and a couple of extra hands to work the booth seems very strongly preferable. Allies like... Matt Machell! Some British debonair is exactly what we need to make for an international booth. Combined with Finnish depression it'll be the most boring booth ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186772/#Comment_186772" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T06:40:35+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  6:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>\n  I live in Duisburg and would be interested in any and all activities you mentioned. I'm very familiar with Spiel (I've been going since 2001) but mainly as a attendee. There's not a lot of RPG activity there (in fact almost none except for people selling books and LARP costumes) but there's plenty of potential. I'm currently working on a couple different games and hope to have my first book done in 2009 so I might even have something to demo.  Irregardless, I would be more than happy to help out in the booth, get together for some gaming, or even just meet up. <br/>\n<br/>\nMJ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186790/#Comment_186790" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T08:00:36+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  8:00AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, excellent. I'm thinking that it'd be great if we could be all inclusive with this "Forge booth at Essen" thing, the way Ron manages to be from year to year at Gencon. In that spirit I'd find it most excellent if we had folks like you, MJ - interested independent designers with their first game at the ashcan stage, or perhaps even finished. I'm already looking forward to meeting you and seeing what sort of game you're brewing. In general I'd say that anybody interested in independent game design and publishing should find a place in this, even if they don't have existing familiarity with the games and culture I and other Forge regulars are going to be pushing at the booth. Doubly so when we consider the fledgling status of the Forge community here in Europe - while there are quite many of us, ranging from players to designers, we haven't really done a lot of this sort of border-crossing yet. Time to start, I say, and get to know each other face to face.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that there is not much RPG activity at Spiel - something like playing full sessions in the convention premises is pretty much out, for example. Last year when visiting Gencon I was pretty impressed by the hotel-based night gaming setup the scene has there, perhaps something similar could be developed to give us some natural venues for roleplaying alongside the convention and especially after-hours. Some suitable restaurant, hotel or other public/semipublic place suitable for a dozen people in 2-3 tables, I'm thinking. Probably not even gaming at first, it's challenge enough to find a quiet place to exchange thoughts and speculate about play. I'm sure people with more Spiel experience and local knowledge have a much better grasp at what is feasible in Essen-the-city and what's not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186797/#Comment_186797" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T08:18:56+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  8:18AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My German fluency is pretty pathetic (considering I've lived here for 7 years) but I'm pretty familiar with Essen. There's actually a decent # of places in the area surrounding the convention center, including hotels with some conference rooms, that might be suitable. However, I agree with you that the first step might be just to first organize a meet and greet the first year and see if we can build from there. While there's very little RPG activity at Essen, there are a huge # of rabid gamers and tons of RPers who actually go to Spiel so I am sure the audience is there.
