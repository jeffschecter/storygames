On Sunday, I found a print copy at our our lovely FLGS (The Dreaming in Seattle's University District), which had just received a shipment from IPR.  So today I was going through my book and musing a few ideas and possible tweaks.  <br/><br/>First, using 2d6 instead of 1d12.  I really dislike wide flat curves (a.k.a. uniform distributions) because the die roll always seems more important than the character sheet.  On the other hand, I do realize that we expect crafty, talented players to stack as much as they can in their favour, but let's look at typical expected rolls.\n<ul><li>A typical static Roll 13 might mean 4 or 5 for Virtue (range of 1-7), maybe a +1 or +2 circumstance and/or narrative modifier, so assuming a default difficulty modifier of 0 (pretty hard), 5-7 (range of 1-9) plus 1d12.</li>\n<li>A typical conflict Roll 13 might mean 4 or 5 for Virtue and +2 to +6 for narrative modifiers (say 2-3 Embellishments), so say perhaps  a total of 8 or 9 plus 1d12 versus the Antagonist's roll.</li></ul>\nAlmost half the time (roll of 8-12), the die roll is contributing more than the character and player.  With 2d6 instead of 1d12, the high rolls would be less frequent (as would the automatic failure and automatic success -- snake eyes and boxcars, 1/36 odds each instead of 1/12).  Based on experience, would this skew the results too much?<br/><br/>Second tweak I was interested in: how about having the players agree on the narrative bonuses for Antagonists in conflict rolls, based on the GM's narration?  Do you think this would slow the game too much?<br/><br/>And how about giving special treatment to conflicts where the <i>loser</i> rolls a 12?  Perhaps this would give the winner a Pyrrhic victory, or the loser would retain some unexpected advantage.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any recommendations on the preferred number of players, based on experience?  It seems like this game might lend itself to very small groups, even single-player games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hieronymous" title="hieronymous"><img alt="hieronymous" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://malcontent.sourdust.com/img/th_coverreve200.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hieronymous">hieronymous</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61094/#Comment_61094" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:37:19+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:37PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 3:55AM by hieronymous.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With respect to 2d6 vs 1d12, one concern would be the weakening of the 1 failure/12 success feature of the current system. More significantly though, a bell curve favors the strong. In a case similar to the static example you cite, let's look 4 Virtue, +2 for narration, no mods. On 1d12, you get success on 7+ (exactly 50%, no coincidence BTW; that's how I devised the "base" difficulty of 0). With 2d6, you increase probability somewhat (since 7 is at the "hump" of the bell curve; 58.3%). So in the midrange, barely any change; none so's you'd notice. Now let's look at 3 Virtue, no mods. Success is on 10+, or 25%, with a d12. For 2d6, though, 10+ is almost 17%. And in cases of "impossible" odds, it gets even worse: under 3% for a natured 12 on 2d12 vs. over 8% with the dodecahedron.<br/><br/>2d6 Roll/Percentage<br/>2 = 2.8%<br/>3 = 5.6%<br/>4 = 8.3%<br/>5 = 11.1%<br/>6 = 13.9%<br/>7 = 16.7%<br/>8 = 13.9%<br/>9 = 11.1%<br/>10 = 8.3%<br/>11 = 5.6%<br/>12 = 2.8%<br/><br/>The upshot is  means that characters with low Virtues or narrative mods are at a progressive disadvantage compared to high Virtue characters. I feel this runs counter to the genre, where children escape ("Defeat") witches.<br/><br/>But look, the proof is in the pudding. I say: try it! Let me know how the recipe turns out.<br/><br/>On to your second point. I don't think the players voting on GM mods is too much of a time problem. Rather, it's a fairness issue. I think the GM has (or ought to have) the interest of the *story* at heart. Players, on the other hand, tend to get attached to individual characters. I think players would be less fair than a Narrator. It boils down to responsibility. I thought my solution of a generic mod for all GM narrations was a good compromise; but again, give it a whirl.<br/><br/>I haven't given much consideration to losers meting out Defeats; I've toyed with "loser narrates", but that's not quite the same. I'd be curious to hear more about how you see a Pyrrhic Defeat might work, mechanically.<br/><br/>Finally, I have found that 7L, oddly, does NOT tend to work well for single-player games. 3-4 players (alas, that old spread!) seems to work well. Players need each other to narrate cool Embellishments to get the creative juices going. Good narration tends to feed on itself. In fact, 7L does well for mass play (5-6 players or maybe more) for this very reason, plus the rules are so light lots of players don't bog things down.<br/><br/>(BTW, years ago  once tried to run a Champions game with a dozen players. What a nightmare! It took a whole evening and several pizzas just to play a single round. The upcoming Super Leagues  will have none of that, I assure you).<br/><br/>Thanks for the great questions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61097/#Comment_61097" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T14:56:18+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  2:56PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2007 6:05PM by Anemone.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>(1) Odds of 2d6 vs. 1d12:</b> OK, I see what the thinking is.  In most games I would find it counterintuitive because if a player sank all her/his points in a given ability, s/he should be able to kick ass at it and not be run over rough-shod by Lady Luck and the dice.  But fairy tales are very much about the triumph of the small over the powerful but undeserving, so why not!  I'll try it your way before I mess with the system.  :-)<br/><br/><b>(2) Player voting on GM mods:</b> I do believe I will try that one.  <i>Seven Leagues</i> strikes me as what Chad Underkoffler calls a "high-trust game."  If the players are drawn into this shared construction of a story (as I expect the typical group at our club to be), then I don't expect selfishness problems.  Besides, the GM would still give the PCs' bonuses so there is the lure of reciprocity.<br/><br/><b>(3) Pyrrhic victories/Partial defeats:</b>  I'd like to borrow some of the narration ideas from <i>octaNe</i> or DitV to make defeat as conducive to a good story as success.  I think it's important to show the players early in the game that "losing" means a setback for the character, not the player, the story, or the group.  In other words, I want the players to relax about the bad die rolls which are bound to show up.  I'm not quite sure what I'll do, but it will probably simply be along the lines of "OK, your character failed, tell me what happens."<br/><br/><b>(4) Ideal group size:</b> The player synergy makes perfect sense, now that you mention it.  It's also true in other open-ended games like <i>Wushu</i>, <i>octaNe</i>, or PDQ.  That's good, because I was planning on offering four spots to begin with, and accepting up to 6 if needed.<br/><br/><b>Large groups:</b> sheesh, yeah, Champions with a large group can be a bear.  At the other end of the spectrum, we've been doing great with 8 players in <i>Wushu: Roanoke</i> (see our thread in the Actual Play section).  :-)  I had 7 players for <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i> last Saturday and that was straining my capacity as a GM.  And I certainly prefer light-weight games when I'm running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61119/#Comment_61119" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T16:44:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2007  4:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you going to release Super Leagues?!!!

Thanks!<br/><br/>I did consider player voting, BTW, for GM mods, and I think I've given the reasons that in the end I went another way. On the other hand, as always I'm very interested in seeing how the game might evolve and improve. If anyone tries out player voting for GM mods, let me know how it goes for you. I'd especially be interested in knowing if it advances the story; promotes better play (under those circumstances does the Narrator stretch herself to curry positive votes from players?); and whether such a system is playable and fluid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61192/#Comment_61192" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T09:55:09+00:00" title="March 15, 2007  9:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2007 10:47AM by Anemone.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing with ideas generated by reading and prepping for <i>Seven Leagues</i>, I'm going to do some partial cross-posting with the 7leagues mailing list.  Hieronymous discussed on a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2478" rel="nofollow">recent S-G actual play thread</a> how he had used the  phrase "velvet box" to thematically link the player characters, asking the players to find some way to include these words in each character's background, to help solve the classic "why are we all together?" and "why do I care?" problems.  I'm a long-time fan of thematically linked PCs and group character creation and I was musing on ways of fostering these links.\n<ul><li>The trick used by Hieronymous: the <b>phrase or keywords</b> that unite the character concepts.
