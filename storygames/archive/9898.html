I'm not discouraging discussion, but what I'm looking for is an opinion one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackground: I have a system that involves a single die roll, roll under a given target number, so low numbers are better than high numbers. Sometimes it's pass/fail, but other times, a degree of success or failure is important. In these cases, I have one of two ways to express the result.<br/>\n<br/>\nMethod 1: Margin of Success or Margin of Failure. If your target number is a 10, and you roll a 6, your Margin of Success (MoS) is 4. If you roll a 17, your Margin of Failure (MoF) is 7. It is possible to succeed with a MoS of 0. It is impossible to fail with an MoF of 0. This can complicate comparisons. Obviously Success beats Failure, but what about MoS:MoS/MoF:MoF? MoS 6 is better than MoS 4, but MoF 2 is better than MoF 7. Whether higher Margin is better switches based on whether or not you're talking about successes or failures.<br/>\n<br/>\nMethod 2: Positive and Negative Margin. Instead of expressing it as MoS 4 or MoF 7, it's simply expressed as Margin 4 and Margin -7. This simplifies comparisons, I think. 4 is definitely higher than -7. Two successes, Margin 6 is better than Margin 4. If it's two failures, Margin -3 is better than Margin -4. The higher margin wins.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Question: Which method is easier, more intuitive, better, in your humble, or not-so-humble opinion?<br/>\n<br/>\n[edited to correct an error that might have been confusing]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220033/#Comment_220033" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T04:02:58+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  4:02AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2009 4:54AM by Wilhelm.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220035/#Comment_220035" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T04:35:35+00:00" title="July 22, 2009  4:35AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear: I'm not asking for suggestions on how to change the system.

A bare success would be described differently than a sweeping success. These are the pass fail situations, and usually fall under the single-roll simple tasks. Rarely will margin matter in a simple task, but I'm pretty sure there may be instances I'm not thinking of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of extended tasks, a negative margin moves you away from success, where a positive margin moves you forward. If the extended task is contested, when you move yourself toward success, you move the opponent toward failure, and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn complex tasks, it's a similar deal, except there's no success point. You're simply trying to get the highest cumulative result you can on a fixed number of rolls. Positive margin increases the result, negative margin reduces the result. Rarely will complex tasks be directly contested; Usually, it will be two parallel complex tasks, with the results compared.<br/>\n<br/>\nNegative margin (which I've been using as basically synonymous with Margin of Failure) has a slightly different effect in combat. If your opponent attacks you and succeeds with a higher margin than you, the difference in your margins is used to buy combat effects to use against you. At the moment, the current rules do not allow for the defender being able to buy combat effects, something I think needs to be rectified.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe target number is determined by the character's abilities. I'm aware that there's nothing particularly innovative about this as a core mechanic, but it works as a fairly solid base upon which more innovative things can be built. Obviously this makes the idea of describing it as a die roll, or actually having it be a die roll untenable. I'd have to take the entire system back to formula to rework an already fairly solid base mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_220246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220246/#Comment_220246" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T02:10:47+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  2:10AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use method 2, and use the quality of the die roll of the winner, to influence what consequences his action may inflict on the looser.<br><br>Good luck!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220265/#Comment_220265" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T07:21:44+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  7:21AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The target number is determined by the character's abilities.

The game is meant to tread the same basic territory as Riddle of Steel: A solid, traditional base systems with some interesting variations supporting the more unique and unusual story structuring elements of play. Even that base system has grown less standard since my original vision, (for the better, I think) but I don't want to go too far out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that a roll-high system would be more intuitive. I think it's more important that the stats on the sheet are intuitive, though. Mage Blade is very character-centric, because that's the sort of fiction I'm into, and want the game to produce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220290/#Comment_220290" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T09:34:59+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  9:34AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Lance,</p>\n<p>If you go with your Margin +4 / Margin -7 idea, be really careful about how you instruct folks to compare the numbers.

I can see how that works. Mechanically the changes would be rather small, though I'd have to rewrite the procedures some.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, it's a matter of style. I'll keep this in mind once I get to the point where people are actually reading the document and following the directions, rolling the dice, seeing how the text and the rules work. For the now, I'm going to keep things the way they are, though. Skill ratings becoming skill difficulties is only a little weird. Changing attribute ratings to attribute difficulties seems really, really counter-intuitive. "Your strength difficulty is 4, which is better than average..."<br/>\n<br/>\nDarcy: A good point. Comparisons will be easy enough. Simply compare them and choose the larger number. Anyone with enough math to know that -1 is larger than -3 should be fine. Those that get easily confused by this will have pointers in the text to clue them in. The difficulty will come when it's necessary to know the difference. I can look at +4 and -7 and tell you the difference is 11, but facility with math isn't a prerequisite for interest in RPGs. I'll have to make sure I'm very plain in describing how to get the difference. Preferably, I would like to do this without using phrasing like "take the absolute value of the negative number..."<br/>\n<br/>\nHm. I actually find that I'm having difficulty thinking about how to explain that to people who may not understand it already, avoiding mathematical terms more complex than add or subtract. For them what know already, it's easy to say "subtract -7 from 4 to get 11". Maybe I should just use examples to demonstrate it thoroughly, and just hope someone in the group has a sufficient grasp of math to explain it to those that still don't get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220332/#Comment_220332" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T11:06:14+00:00" title="July 23, 2009 11:06AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like Spread in Passages (a d20 hack system). Justin was dealing with a similar issue about negatives and such, and his text was straining to work with a +/- system. In the end, I suggested Spread (I might not have come up with the actual term) while editing it, and it essentially did the "absolute value" bit of the math by default.<br><br>So, in short, I think MOS/MOF is the way to go, and it's really intuitive that "Failed by 5" is worse than "Failed by 3" and the additive "Succeed by 4 is 11 better than Failed by 7" process is pretty clear, too (you just add the values, if it's S v F, and you subtract low from high, for comparative degree of S or F).<br><br>Maybe Justin can chime in and correct anything I mis-recall.
