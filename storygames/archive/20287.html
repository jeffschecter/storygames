In it, a secretive part of the British government keeps knowledge about the occult and extra-dimensional entities under wraps. After WWII, it was found out that magic is actually a morn of mathematics, and the right kinds of computations can tap into energy and information from other dimensions... and things in those dimensions can take notice. Facing a catastrophic breach of reality as people and computers are becoming more widespread, the Laundry and their foreign counterparts must keep this knowledge from the public and draft anyone who knows too much into service, often resulting inthe absolutely wrong people essentially fighting Cthulhu. The result is a fantastic combination of Lovecraftian horror, office humor and the cognitive dissonance of using occult magic to do pretty mundane stuff like zombies as night guards and daemonic banking.<br/><br/>There is already a commercially available and very well supplemented The Laundry RPG available (which I promptly acquired upon release) but it is built on top of Call of Cthulhu and after trying it out I concluded that d100 skill rolls is a world I'm not going into again. So I started working with the system I love, Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>To give a sense of the game, I'll quote myself from the MC sheet: <br/>"As Master of Ceremonies, your job is to <br/>1. provide an adventure that is both funny and horrific (tall order, I know) <br/>2. place the agents in situations that force them to endure excruciatingly frustrating office hijinks <br/>3. place agents in mortal peril not only for their lives and souls, but those of others <br/>4. hand out small victories, but hint that the world is still getting worse every day<br/>You will fulfill this job by running the game and making moves as needed. During a session the situation will go from bad to worse."<br/><br/>Each of the six playbooks describing the agents is based on one of the characteristics: calm, hard, charm, sharp and lore, plus one "joker":<br/><br/>The Spook is a spoof of the MI6 agent, cool under any situation but also opportunistic and kind of an ass to other people. Players usually embrace their inner asshole to look down on other agents.<br/><br/>The Officer is a police/military type responsible for calling and coordinating reinforcements in case the agents get into a bit of a situation. <br/><br/>The Manager is the formal leader of the group and has the questionable honor of creating the department the agents are in, including any and all deficiencies. It is a marvelous thing to see the other players blame The Manager for nearly all their problems.<br/><br/>The Geek is the most iconic playbook for fans of The Laundry novels, as The Geek's technical knowledge means they are the most able to use magic in the system. Hacking also often happens because players expect it from the genre.<br/><br/>The Expert is the only playbook with access to traditional, mind-as-computation ritual magic that has been around for millenia. The Expert's command of the lore stat means that they are the most able to discern what kind of occult activities are involved in the mission, but if you read the "Peek behind the curtain" move you'll get why knowledge isn't always blissful.<br/><br/>The Chosen is the straight man of the group that has to face all the weirdness but is also subjected to a lot of weirdness themselves. Modeled pretty closely on the protagonist of The Laundry books, Bob Howard, The Chosen is often played as either oblivious or painfully aware of the horror surrounding the agents.<br/><br/>I'd love to get feedback and questions about the hack and the accompanying scenario. I have run the system for a total of four times over two years, and as the hack develops I'll probably write some sort of an introduction for it to enable larger distribution.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/onrigato" title="onrigato"><img alt="onrigato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/onrigato">onrigato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447215/#Comment_447215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-24T17:09:36+00:00" title="July 24, 2015  5:09PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Tybraal! I'm also a huge fan of Apocalypse World and had the same reaction to the Laundry RPG\u2014great setting, but the rules aren't my bag. I have a few questions on your hack before I offer any feedback.\n<ul><li>How are you handling PC death? Apocalypse World leaves it up to the player (at least until you run out of debilities), but Lovecraftian RPGs tend to leave PCs' fates to the whims of the dice. <br/></li><li>Is sanity loss represented in the game? Can a PC exit the story due to going insane?<br/></li><li>Is there a help/interfere basic move?<br/></li><li>Do the PC relationships have a mechanical effect?<br/></li><li>When and how do players normally mark experience? I noticed that <b><i>seduce or manipulate</i></b> uses marking experience as an incentive. </li></ul>\nI really like the NecronomiPhone move and how the MC has both comedic and horrific moves. I think you've got a great start here.<br/><br/>I'm a newbie to the Story Games forum, so I hope I'm following the forum rules and stuff. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tybraal" title="Tybraal"><img alt="Tybraal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tybraal">Tybraal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447597/#Comment_447597" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-04T07:37:21+00:00" title="August  4, 2015  7:37AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi onrigato! Thanks for your questions, it's greatly appreciated and I'm happy that you share my passion for both AW and The Laundry. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>How are you handling PC death? Apocalypse World leaves it up to the player (at least until you run out of debilities), but Lovecraftian RPGs tend to leave PCs' fates to the whims of the dice. </blockquote>\nI think that within the context of this hack, character death should be tied to the Doom Clock, i.e. only in late game when the stakes have been raised, and even then as a result of the agents fucking up. I prefer excitement to arise from the fiction of the game, instead of the meta-excitement that the players know they are at the mercy of a game system. Then again, death is not the worst possible outcome...\n<blockquote>Is sanity loss represented in the game? Can a PC exit the story due to going insane?</blockquote>\nExcellent question. I really, really dislike all sanity systems with the possible exception of Unknown Armies and think horror comes from language, not systems. However, this gives me an idea that maybe a sanity system could be present for elongated play as a cumulative stress mechanic, i.e. "Can I push myself to do this one more thing or should I apply for that sick leave and therapy?" This would also be more in line with The Laundry novels than "oh no I saw a deep one roll sanity".\n<blockquote>Is there a help/interfere basic move?</blockquote>\nThere should be! I recall running the games so that the helper rolls an appropriate stat to help/hinder at the lack of a relationship mechanic, see below.\n<blockquote>Do the PC relationships have a mechanical effect?</blockquote>\nNot presently, no. This is a direct result of being written for a convention scenario where players need the trigger to form in-character relationships but the freedom to express those in whatever way they choose on the spot. In campaign play I imagine that you could have a AW style relationship mechanic, or one which would be tied to organizational proximity and an "institutional trust" that could be used to help or hidner.\n<blockquote>When and how do players normally mark experience? I noticed that seduce or manipulate uses marking experience as an incentive.</blockquote>\nThat's an oversight as well, it should read +1 forward for convention scenarios. I think campaign rules might encourage agents to put themselves in harm's way and dig deeper into Forbidden Things to get experience, setting a balance between safety and power that is typical for The Laundry - you get powerful in the process of breaking yourself.<br/><br/>Thanks again for the questions, they really gave me thoughts for how to expand this into a more complete hack. Any further feedback is also appreciated and I'll try to check back more often!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/onrigato" title="onrigato"><img alt="onrigato" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/onrigato">onrigato</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447689/#Comment_447689" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T02:34:39+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  2:34AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad that my questions were helpful. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I've been working intermittently on my own AW hack that sometimes feels like an AW/CoC crossover (depending on what day it is), so we've probably thought about some of the same design issues.\n<blockquote>I think that within the context of this hack, character death should be tied to the Doom Clock, i.e. only in late game when the stakes have been raised, and even then as a result of the agents fucking up. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>I really, really dislike all sanity systems with the possible exception of Unknown Armies and think horror comes from language, not systems.</blockquote>\nWhat do you see as driving the tension or risk in the game, given that character death and insanity aren't as much of a threat? Does the fear of failing the mission provide that tension? \n<blockquote>However, this gives me an idea that maybe a sanity system could be present for elongated play as a cumulative stress mechanic, i.e. "Can I push myself to do this one more thing or should I apply for that sick leave and therapy?"</blockquote>\nI'd love to see where you're going with this. I've found it difficult to come up with a CoC-style "sanity death spiral" that isn't clunky. The characters in AW are generally on an upward trajectory (better stats, more moves, more improvements); it feels like AW doesn't want to accommodate a downward trajectory.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
