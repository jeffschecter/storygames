Most historical Spanish designs I can think of right now try to adapt or combine American rpg tropes with Spanish/European elements. Some examples:<br/><br/>- <b>Aquelarre</b>, the first professionally published Spanish rpg, was set in gritty Medieval Spain and used a BRP-like mechanic<br/>- <b>Mutantes en la Sombra</b> was about modern-day psionically gifted individuals waging a secret war against CIA, MI6, KGB, etc. What was really inordinate in this game was not the presence of psionic abilities, but rather the outrageous amount of firepower put in the characters' hands (gun control is a <b>lot</b> more strict in Spain than in the US, but nevertheless the game included long lists of military-grade guns and fairly involved rules for firefights and wound determination :-P)<br/>- <b>Superheroes, Inc.</b>, with European and Spanish superheroes. Percentile mechanics and random-rolled superpowers<br/>- <b>Barrio Chino,</b> a humouristic game about lowlife scum and their antics... Lots of innuendo and bawdy jokes here<br/>- <b>Capit\xe1n Alatriste</b>, based in the historical swashbuckling novels by Arturo P\xe9rez-Reverte, with a very GURPS-like system<br/>- <b>Ragnarok</b>, a modern-day horror game by the designers of Mutantes en la Sombra. <br/><br/>Mechanic or design-wise, most games are fairly traditional in their workings and structure, though I'd say this is beginning to change. I think there is a growing interest in story games and there are some new games out there, like <b>Necrorama - Black Thrilling Tales</b> (Javier Arce's wonderful pulp/steampunk/dark fantasy game), which show this influence. Another interesting example of a non-standard game is <b>Libido</b>, a game explicitly focused in the erotic thriller genre (think Basic Instinct or Color of Night).<br/><br/>A notable exception was the now-forgotten (released in 1993) <b>Analaya, Tormenta de Arena</b>, a short-lived post-apocalyptic fantasy game specifically designed for collaborative story-telling. I don't have it, so I can't add much more, but it seemed to be a very innovative design for the time, judging by what little info there is about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142170/#Comment_142170" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T10:29:03+00:00" title="May  3, 2008 10:29AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2008 10:29AM by Moreno R..">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/>Does your country have a game design culture? </blockquote>\nNo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142173/#Comment_142173" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-03T11:03:09+00:00" title="May  3, 2008 11:03AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2008 11:03AM by Lord_Minx.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/>Does your country have a game design culture?</blockquote>\nNo.Same here.

In Spain there is a certain game design culture (not very widespread), but I think it has been mostly focused on replicating American/traditional rpg models for years.

There's been people designing games on and off for years - I think the first published one was MEGA, 1987 - but always loners, some guy who's run a game with his group and decides to publish it. <br/><br/>However, a few years ago we created a web forum, and Michael Sollien started out the R.I.S.K. competition - design a game in one/two weeks. The scene virtually exploded - at least it looks that way in hindsight. A dozen games every year, quickly settling on a tradition of short, concept-heavy games, and suddenly a lot of people came to the realization that it's not that hard. One-pagers are almost the norm.<br/><br/>Then Tomas M\xf8rkrid came up with the idea of the role-playing poem. I think more than 20 such poems were written and played just last year. <br/><br/>Now, this playful scene has come about much because we're doing social stuff - getting together and meeting each other. Design and writing workshops. House cons where we try out new games. Role-playing salons. Playtesting each others' games. Seminars. Game designers' association. If we'd only done stuff over the internet, it wouldn't work. But there's openness, collaboration. Last night I was out with two other game designers; one of them I'd never met, but my friend invited him over, and he rode the bus for three hours just to drink with us. My house con is open for everyone who wants to come - even if they're scary people. Itras By, to be published at this year's Arcon, is written by two people, but includes text from four or five more, stuff the authors liked and asked if they could use. Very much a culture of "that's a great idea, let me steal it, change it and give it back to you!"<br/><br/>It's a very good time to be designing games in Norway.<br/><br/>[EDIT] Oh, and larps! Great stuff there as well - but it's not my specialty. However, there's a lot of crossover - most game designers I know have been in at least a few larps, and some are larp designers as well. Many role-playing poems are more or less in larp form.

Sure, people post their D&amp;D house rules, GURPS knockoffs or even Fuzion plugins all the time, usually with the objective of making the base system more "realistic" and ending up piling one table after another - that's not tradition, that's exactly the lack thereof. A couple of such systems were even published, which is a major achievement since even getting basic D&amp;D books is not that easy. Most of such "systems" are only intended for personal use and are of little interest for outsiders - that's why I keep on calling them "systems" and not "games"; one cannot just take one of them and start playing.

I'd say at least half of them were unexpectedly good, and designed not by people who are known for their game design skills, but rather by regular gamers - so it shows that the interest for the game design is out there.

On the other hand, we have some individuals who design games (and some very good, traditional roleplaying games - it's just that a few one-man-endeavours do not make a culture), and on the other, the most vocal and visible Finnish roleplaying design in the past fifteen years or so has been the larp design culture. I view it more as event design, since things-usually-understood-important-for-games have very little to do with it. I don't think it has really paid more than a lip service to anglo-american tabletop roleplaying game design (or larp game design, for that matter) since early 90's, and the culture has been developing on it's own comfortable vacuum until recently.<br/><br/>And that's what pretty much sets it apart from rest of the world, though less so from the other Nordic countries. Another thing that comes into mind is that the culture is very much based on oral tradition; the published games that have emerged from this design culture have appeared in last few years, and apart from some   articles in Knudepunkt-books, there's very little written documentation on how the design principles have evolved during the years.<br/><br/>One should note, though, that there is some kind of narrative/boardgame/indie/etc -design culture forming at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142587/#Comment_142587" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T03:42:05+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  3:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Radaghast</cite>However, we've had two design-the-RPG-in-two-weekends contests recently (the second one was organised by yours truly), and each of them provided 8 indie games that were actually quite nice.

Each year, 20-30 scenarios are developed for the game convention. These scenarios are in fact more like stand alone games designed to fit the typical Fastaval setup: 5-7 players in one room for 4-6 hours. One game master prepares the game based on the written scenario, usually with little or no contact with the game designer.<br/><br/>All scenarios are read by a committee of experienced gamers (with spread in interest) in the month up to the convention. At the final day of the convention, five scenarios are nominated in each of five categories (Best player material, Best story, Best presentation, Best scenario, Best mechanics). At the closing banquet, a winner is declared in each category, each winner receives a golden statue.<br/><br/>The best of these scenarios get a broader audience as they are published (free) on the net and are set up in other conventions and played in groups around the country. This focus on the written scenario and the celebration makes sure that the best ideas are fed back into the creative group of people who mixes them with new ideas and create new games for coming years.<br/><br/>Of commercial games in DK, there is Fusion (and some older ones). Fusion is investigation in a near future Copenhagen noir. Game mechanics is so-and-so, mostly sim, but the setting is great, especially when you are a Dane.<br/><br/>In recent years, LARP has become much more popular than tabletop games. To the degree that you should be careful about declaring yourself as a 'roleplayer' without immediately adding a disclaimer like 'but not one of those dressing up as elves and orcs and battling with latex weapons in the woods'. I am not into LARP, but I'm pretty sure that they create many excellent games which may or may not be special to DK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142909/#Comment_142909" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T11:57:02+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 11:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a country has a unique design culture, how would most people identify it from within that culture?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142923/#Comment_142923" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T12:13:51+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 12:13PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: longhorn</cite>If a country has a unique design culture, how would most people identify it from within that culture?</blockquote>\nBy reading the INTARNET.

There is something like 58% Deutch, 41% French and 1% German, with tense (and imho pointless) opposition between politicians of the Deutch and French-speaking communities.

It was followed by <i>L\xe9gendes Celtiques</i> and <i>L\xe9gendes des 1001 nuits</i>. The system was afterwards (1986) simplified and sold under the <i>Premi\xe8res l\xe9gendes</i> name, with multiple settings: <i>L\xe9gendes de la Table ronde</i>, <i>L\xe9gendes celtiques</i> and <i>L\xe9gendes de la vall\xe9e des rois</i>.</li>\n<li><i>MEGA</i>, 1984 (sorry Matthijs, it seems the French were there first), published as an exceptional issue of the <i>Jeux &amp; Strat\xe9gies</i> magazine, a game where you play \u201cgalactic messengers\u201d (mega) sent through interdimensional portals to solve all kind of troubles everywhere in the universes.</li>\n<li><i>Empire Galactique</i>, 1984, a very pleasant space-opera game, with no really detailed setting. The second edition (1987) was published as pocketbooks by a \u201cordinary book editor\u201d to be sold in the general distribution (it was a failure).</li>\n<li><i>Mal\xe9fices</i>, 1985, an investigation game with supernatural in the 1870-1914 France.

I like this one very much for its unique setting and color.</li>\n<li><i>Bitume</i>, 1986, a postapocalyptic game, by one of the most well known, most vocal and provocative and most productive French rpg creator : Croc. His most known following games, which have an Indie feel at least in their settings, are:\n<ul><li><i>Animonde</i>, 1988, "romantic-fantasy", a setting with no metal, no violence. Most things are achieved through symbiosis with cute animals (and violence destroy that symbiosis). Your social level is determined / showed by the height of your heels.</li>\n<li><i>Berlin XVIII</i>, 1988, (the only succesful game of the "Universom" product line), kind of cyberpunk, you play cops in 2070's Berlin. Dystopian universe.</li>\n<li><i>In nomine satanis / Magna veritas</i>, 1989, probably one if not the French bestseller (in France). You play either Angels or Demons on actual Earth, using d666. The English translation is sensibly different from the original, which is more humoristic and ironic.</li><li><i>Bloodlust</i>, 1991 (a new edition is planned this year), very violent universe were you play a (very mortal) warrior and your neighbour plays his sentient immortal god-weapon. The "theme" is violent emotions, desire, passions, obsessions.</li>\n<li><i>Heavy Metal</i>, 1991, you play robotic AI charged with upholding the robots/AI dominance over humanity and eradicate all rebellion.</li>\n<li><i>Nightprowler</i>, 1995, a game dedicated to playing thieves and only thieves in a medieval fantastic setting.</li>\n<li><i>COPS</i>, 2003, a new take (I think) on Berlin XVIII: cops in 2030's California.</li></ul>\n</li><li><i>Zone</i>, 1987, play bored and sometimes violent teenager in French suburbs in the 80\u2019s (this is very different from American suburbs). Kind of Misspent Youth but with the game-design sensibility of the time.<br/></li><li><i>Hurlements</i>, 1989, an "initiatory" game and a very great one. The players know nothing before starting to play. They do not have access to their character sheet. It needs a great trust in the GM and had the reviewers scratching their heads of how to do a good review without revealing anything. The game is somehow ruined if you know the secrets. A great game. Probably the one that most promoted blackbox simulationism as a very good model in France.(If you ever want to play <i>Hurlements</i>, never read anything about <i>Chim\xe8re</i>, its successor which premise reveals the most important secrets of its predecessor.</li>\n<li><i>Athanor</i>, 1989, a game about the earth in 2300. A virus outbreak has totally changed civilization as now individuals mutate and adapt (physically and mentally) to their environment in a matter of weeks.</li>\n<li><i>Nephilim</i>, 1992 (translated, although I don\u2019t know if the translation is a good one), one of my favorite game. Very detailed contemporary occult setting, very specific and rich universe. Engine based on Chaosium\u2019s BRP. (The third edition, <i>Nephilim : revelation</i>, 2001, is very different in setting, tone and system. I don\u2019t know much about it.) </li>\n<li><i>Thoan</i>, 1995, play in Philip Jose Farmer\u2019s World of Tiers setting.</li>\n<li><i>Guilde</i>, 1996, I think this one is somewhat similar to Seventh Sea (1999?), but I don\u2019t know for sure as I never have played either. </li>\n<li><i>Polaris</i>, 1997, humanity now lives under the sea to escape the inhospitable surface of the earth. Very detailed engine.</li>\n<li><i>Agone</i>, 1999 (translated in English), a very poetic and enticing setting and a broken engine. <i>Very</i> pleasant setting.</li>\n<li><i>Post Mortem</i>, 2003, play your defunct characters from other rpg in a crazy underworld.

There's a pretty big chunk of interesting, anarchic history there. That I personally don't know to much about... something like Dogs for South America... I dunno..
