Now I want to geek out over the coolest moment from your most recent session.  Me:<br/><br/>We're playtesting <i>Fiasco</i>.  My scheming old west madam with a wicked old peach pit for a soul just got shanked by a sourdough, after she gloatingly revealed her elaborate plan to cut him and his mongoloid protege out of the big score of Spanish silver.  She's bleeding out on the floor of his shack.  It's that kind of game, so far.<br/><br/>...and in comes her former lover, a rich dude she's reconnected with through violence and perfidy.  They are truly meant to be together, and there's a moment of genuine pathos as he mourns for what should have been.  There's a tear-stained love letter, it is very sad, boo hoo.  And he gets up to go kill the man who killed her, and her dying words are "forgive him", which as a player came out of <i>nowhere</i>, and he does.  I was so happy!<br/><br/>What we do is sort of amazing.

And we're playing out this "bounty hunter vs. biker" sort of thing in a gun duel in an abandoned warehouse, and of course I take advantage of getting early Flashback to set the two of them up as having been in a romantic relationship and all that kind of stuff. Well, this game does bad things to its characters, and so the relationship goes sour and my character is playing mind games with Raquel's character (and, I'll admit, some of that was going on the player level, too.) The fun thing about this game is that we're playing the final duel as we see the flashbacks unfold, so there are all kinds of opportunities to reincorporate. So I'm setting up Tess (Raquel's character) as being this nasty, cold-hearted person because she fought to get custody of the kids from Weeze. Of course, by this point, we know that Weeze is a lousy deadbeat with a silver tongue and a fiery temper. So, if you weren't in the heat of the game, you know that you'd be rooting for Tess.<br/><br/>But Raquel <i>was</i> in the heat of the game, and so I describe how Weeze represents himself at the custody hearing, making an impassioned plea before the judge and how Tess's lawyer completely shuts him down and the judge throws the book at him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the duel, as Tess is trying to get a shot at Weeze, he says, "You already took the kids from me. Wasn't that enough?" So she comes down the stairs, pointing her .45 revolver at him. He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a picture of the kids. He looks at her, pleadingly.<br/><br/>It's a tense showdown. Both of them are already bleeding from multiple wounds.<br/><br/>In Flashback, we see Tess chase off Weeze, yelling at him in front of the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Her gun slips to her side.<br/><br/>She sits down, rocking back and forth.<br/><br/>There's a pause.<br/><br/>Then, coldly he says, "You always were a bitch."<br/><br/>His shotgun roars. Then he drags himself out of the warehouse.<br/><br/>Yeah, he played her one last time.<br/><br/>It was terrible. It was horrifying. It was exactly how the game should work.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183765/#Comment_183765" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T14:30:04+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  2:30PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2008 2:31PM by Epidiah_Ravachol.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently played in a D&amp;D 4e min-campaign in which the PCs were all goblins, part of a tribe of goblins that spend their entire lives in a single room of a dungeon guarding a healing potion (known to us only as the Purple Liquid). Our adventure began immediately after a group of adventurers stormed the room, slaughtered our loved ones, left our unconscious bodies for dead, took the Purple Liquid, and--most importantly--left the door open.<br/><br/>The whole things was filled with wonder and humor as we first tentatively explored the other rooms of our dungeon, and then discovered the viciously bright outside world on our quest to recover the the Purple Liquid. Cool moments abound, but for me the best, the absolute best, was how it ended.<br/><br/>Our little naive goblins were bad-asses, but not very street smart. And throughout the campaign people were promising us the Purple Liquid if we just complete some Herculean tasks for them. At the very end of this string of adventures, while battling giant bug monsters for the sake of some underground crime lord who was in possession of a giant, presumably magical ruby wanted by a dragon who was terrorizing a town of pinklings who we thought might have a clue as to where our Purple Liquid has gone to, we uncovered a whole stash of Purple Liquid vials which we spirited away to some small corner of the dungeon and proceeded to spend the rest of our lives--and the lives of our children, and the lives of our children's children--guarding, leaving the crime lord, the dragon, and all the pinklings to sort things out for themselves.<br/><br/>It was so anti-climatic and yet it felts so incredibly right. "Wait, did we just end this?" "I . . . I think we did."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183838/#Comment_183838" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T21:15:58+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  9:15PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Epidiah,<br/><br/>That is abso-fucking-lutely fantastic.

Oh. yes...<br/>1) A witness has been murdered in the heart of Berlin. The team is theer to investiagte. Standing in the driving rain are two German detectives, real tough-guy coppers. They roll up on our RPA team looking badass in their leather trench-coats. Start talking, asking questions, demanding official papers.<br/><br/>My reedy, American desk-officer comes up with a fist, clenched, and a Bogey line: "Don't make me smack you, Fritz"<br/><br/>2) The last Prisoner in Spandau Prison:<br/>I don't care about NPCs usually, but Jason made this  guy come alive. I could "see" the swinging, naked yellow light bulb and "read" his facial expressions. Man, I still hate that guy and his blaise attitude.<br/><br/>3) Now we've been on the case for a while. We've snuck out to the Russian Zone in a stolen truck. The spot is a ruined farmhouse/ military hut. The sun is shining through all the lost roofing plates. Chickens are roosting in the files drawers of this old nazi-superweapon project. Me? I'm skeered, and out in the truck revvng the engine while my team-mates crawl along rusted I-beams, smgs in hand to investigate the pods left behind. Because- --Damn! NaziZombies !?! Right?1? Not just Nazi-Zombies... but Nazi-Mecha Zombies! Okay?!?<br/><br/>Y'know how folks talk about immersion? I was __there__!!  In character? I dunno. But... man! It felt real as fuck-all. And I'm not usually an Immersion guy.<br/><br/>Fiasco:<br/>It hit half-way through the game. The scene: My character bis cutting up a weaponized -leopard, looking for stolen jewels. The camera pans back. The characters drop from sight, and we just have shadows on a tiled kitchen wall in black-and-white. Suddenly red, red blood sprays up on the tile, the only color in the scene, as my character's shadow digs into the leopard's guts and we fade out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184074/#Comment_184074" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T03:41:27+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  3:41AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At Monday night's GURPS game Dotta the Gypsy, traumatized not so long ago by an encounter with a sexual-sadist serial killer, has developed severe issues with men and intimacy. We all know that she needs to enjoy a good time with a man (sexual or otherwise) to help banish this fear from her mind, but she won't do, she's too damaged.<br/><br/>So we go to a weapon-smiths to get some information from a friend of a friend who comes from a part of the country we need information about, and Gregoir (as he's called) turns out to be a bald-dwarf-sex-magnet (sort of a short ginger Yul Brynner if you can imagine that) who takes a shine to her. Cue unbelievable quantities of carry-on style innuendo and really pathetic crude jokes. It should have been awful, unfunny, and traumatic to Dotta all at the same time, but somehow it wasn't. He was just so comical that he cut through her defenses and you could see how, finally, she was letting herself soften. I was supposed to be playing Gregoir at this point, but really it was the whole table. Everyone was coming up with corny lines and stupid jokes. It could have been comedy, but you could just feel that they were all wanting to create something that would heal Dotta's pain, just for a little bit.<br/><br/>In the end she left with him and didn't come back till the next day ... it was wonderful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184089/#Comment_184089" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T06:59:48+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  6:59AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're playing PTA, "Wheel Galleons of His Majesties North American Land Navy", and it's totally berserk.  The main deal is there's a beautiful Indian maiden that three protagonists are desperately in love with.  The crux of this episode is going to be finding out who she chooses as her lover.  Her father is the HMS Goliath's scout and my guy, Midshipman Ned Proudfoot, has him as a Connection.  And naturally the maiden gets kidnapped by hostile Indians, and the three lovers (a supercilious French Captain, the ineffectual drunkard Major Burns, and the all-American British-hater Proudfoot) tear off after her, guided by the scout.  And we find her!  In a village, surrounded by women and children!  All the braves are out preparing to ambush our land galleon.  So we're scoping it out, it's probably a trap, and we get to see the real Proudfoot in action - we have a great scene where he tries to persuade her dad that we need to massacre these people, "to send a message in the only language they understand", and basically outs himself as an Indian-hating racist to the (Indian) father of his (Indian) object of desire.  It was horrible and great.  I love chewing the scenery, and I love being surprised by characters.<br/><br/>Burns ended up shooting him in the back later on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184127/#Comment_184127" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T11:38:10+00:00" title="December 18, 2008 11:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Burning Wheel Thieves game I am running right now we have had a bunch of cool moments.<br/><br/>Maybe not my favorite but definately the most memorable was when one the characters Malak the Longblade, a whore monger and duelist who has become the subject of a local playwright epics painting him as a Robin Hood sort of character which couldn't be farther from the truth, was keeping an eye on a building that the other players were sneaking into to intercept an assassin and struck up a conversation with the guard over a pipe. Naturally the guard started asking him questions about the play and if he really had done all of that. Malak hates it when people bring up the play. So he stabbed the guard to death with his pipe stem in a bloody vs test.

The whole game everyone has disliked Tom (both IC and OOC), as he's too harsh, too violent, too crass. Before he was taken, Tom had a girlfriend named Julie. Julie's dad abused her. Tom and Julie were going to run away together. Tom got taken instead. <br/><br/>Tom comes back, and it takes him some time to find Julie as almost 30 years have passed. When he finds her she's dying of AIDS, and he only has time with her hold her hand. (The soundtrack for the scene was the Indigo Girl's cover of "Romeo and Juliet.") They didn't speak, there wasn't anything to say. <br/><br/>Moment 2: <br/><br/>Next game, Tom is given on loan from the Queen of Spring to the King of Pride as a knight. Tom really likes the King of Pride, he's the first guy in the whole game to treat him with dignity and respect. <br/><br/>The King of Pride has a problem: the local temperance league is on the verge of shutting down his casino. The head of temperance league is Juile's kid sister, Rose. Tom is put in charge of taking apart the temperance league, with oaths on everything from his virility to his soul on the line. But despite it all, he won't let anyone touch Rose. And it becomes obvious that as long as Rose is standing, the movement is going away. So the King of Pride sends one of Tom's lovers after Rose. <br/><br/>Things get complicated. The Queen of Spring is about to hand over the keys to the city to the King of Pride. Tom nearly kills his lover to save Rose, and the King of Pride sends Tom's best friend to "take him out of the picture." Instead Tom shows up at the ceremony at the Summer Tree. He and the King of Pride have a duel to the death using sledge hammers. Tom wins, and nearly crippled and with his oaths about to destroy him, goes to the Summer Tree and takes the keys to the city. Bleeding and with a broken leg, a broken arm, and a broken skull he slurrs out to the assembled "The King is dead, long live the King." <br/><br/>No one speaks, no one moves, everyone is scared shitless of Tom and more scared of Tom being King. Tom falls over, unconscious, at the foot of the Summer Tree. <br/><br/>Fade to black. <br/><br/>Now we have to see if that's going to actually get him out of his oaths to the crown. My bet is no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184331/#Comment_184331" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-19T17:14:47+00:00" title="December 19, 2008  5:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple nights ago I'm running a Skype game of Inspectres for a couple dyed-in-the-wool trad gamers who have agreed to give "this indie game thing" a try because I made my Connive roll.  The "job" is called "The Case of the Undead Bro" and the two PCs are researching a client's brother who has recently returned from Uruguay and the client thinks he's undead because of the weird graveyard smell on him and the fact that he keeps throwing away huge contractor bags full of heavy trash in the apartment trash bin.<br/><br/>The PCs head over to the trash bin and open it up tentatively (rolling Academics for the search and one players rolls a Amazing! success).  They rip open one of the bags to discover... (player authoring the result:) it is filled with human body parts that are STILL MOVING.  The player who rolled the success (and also got a Cool die from the Stress roll, lucky bastich) declares that the brother is not undead, he has been cursed to attract zombies like a magnet and has been killing them as they show up and then disposing of what's left in the trash bins.  woot, I think I really dig these players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184371/#Comment_184371" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T01:27:49+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  1:27AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2008 1:28AM by Eldir.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>In the end she left with him and didn't come back till the next day ... it was wonderful.</blockquote>\nThat is one of the funniest yet most heartwarming scenes ever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>I think I really dig these players.</blockquote>\nYou should!
