We didn't quite get as far as playing out in the sun with a jug of Pimms, but we did have fun.<br/><br/>Both games had five players. <br/><br/>The first game was a good laugh, and played similarly to how it was supposed to play out. Lots of influence attempts, lots of playing while aiming for the dice. What we missed was the 'take your time' advice: people were rushing towards invoking the mechanics without taking the time to chew the scenery. We should also have done more to make the relationships drive influence attempts, as the lord of the manor ended up being rather reactive. <br/><br/>I ended up being the murderer, after revealing a suitably horrific and perverse backstory.<br/><br/>The second game was just hysterically funny. The game had a bunch of people big in the Freeforming scene and they took to the setup like ducks to water. I pointed out the lessons learnt from the earlier game and we took it to heart. The game started with the retired priest having buggered his young nephew, along with various other misdemeanours. The first bit of the game was hysterical, and we had to stop several times to allow our sides to recover and the tears of laughter to dry. The second act of the game wasn't so good in comparison, though still good. A lot of the reveals were evidence-based, instead of revealing more about the relationship with the victim (though we never did quite establish how the butler ended up in the rose garden wearing only a horse bridle).<br/><br/>This group didn't much like the black/white dice mechanic. They were quite happy playing their characters the way they wanted, and felt that the dice was an unnecessary crutch. But the relationship setup was great.<br/><br/>During the rest of the con, I kept hearing one of the players telling everyone just how good it was.<br/><br/>Neil.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280219/#Comment_280219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T17:44:11+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  5:44PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks so much, Neil.
