                    So, apropos of the de-geeking threads, I was wondering if people would share techniques and experiences of inviting new people who haven't gamed before to your games.  <br/><br/>The times I've done it, I've generally invited them to a one-shot adventure -- often with pregenerated characters.  Alternatively, I have invited them in for "guest star" spots in an ongoing campaign with a pregenerated character who was written into the scenario.  If they like it, they may join the campaign with a character of their own (usually built with some help).  <br/><br/>For example, I invited my friend Shannon to a playtest of the adventure we did of the Truth &amp; Justice game that I ran at GenCon.  She read a number of comic books, but had never role-played before.  I had known her through parenting things in our area, and our kids play together commonly.  So I just included her in the email which I sent to everyone (6 players, I think) inviting them to the game.  The particular system (T&amp;J) was new to everyone so I explained it and we went ahead with the adventure.  She took to it pretty well, I thought.  However, we didn't finish the scenario.  I went to GenCon and ran it twice there, and we never regathered to finish it.  <br/><br/>Anyone else?  Any good techniques?                </div>

                            I got my brother to play Dogs In The Vineyard. I was just fairly honest about it: "Do you fancy playing this game on Thursday? It's a roleplaying game: not like Dungeons and Dragons, though, it's all about moral dilemmas and stuff. It's really good."<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

Same.  Generally, with simple rules.<br/><br/>And, usually, to LARP.                        </div>

                            [edited for bulleting]<br/><br/>As I said in the Outed thread, I played Don't Rest Your Head with a couple of friends, one, Ed, new to gaming. We did the session yesterday. <br/><br/>Here's how I went about it.
<ul>
<li>We were having a pint and talking about creative stuff; he's teaching music on an adult community scheme and doing a course on electroacoustic music.<br/></li><li>In that context, he brought up the gaming, which he was dimly aware of. <br/></li><li>He said that he'd be curious to try it, as he respects my taste and guesses there must be something to it.<br/></li><li>We talked about a few concepts, and DRYH shook out as something he thought sounded cool. We didn't get into anything about how the game worked.<br/></li><li>I said I'd set something up, and checked it would be ok to play with someone else, which was fine. I said to leave it with me and I'd set it up. </li>
</ul>During all this, a few points.
<ul>
<li>I was not defensive about the activity, and did not define it in the negative (I think he mentioned Dungeons &amp; Dragons and I said "kind of...not a million miles away", but not to worry about comparisons).<br/></li><li>Conversely, I was not overenthusiastic and surprised about the fact he wanted to do this. This was not my special club he was electing to join, and an agreement to do this activity together does not change our friendship.*<br/></li><li>I did not bombard him with any kind of expectancy or demands (although see below).</li>
</ul>Following this,
<ul>
<li>I got in touch with a some other people, and via a couple of emails found and confirmed a date that Ed and another friend could make. It'd be the three of us. Ideally I would have had it so the two of them could have met up casually beforehand - it almost happened at an open drinks event recently but life got in the way. Nevertheless, these were two people I would have been happy to introduce in any social context. <b>This is the most important thing.</b><br/></li><li>Via internal mail in my building I sent Ed two A4 sheets - the first 2 pages of the game (flavour text and 'what the game is') on one, and the rules summary sheet and a picture on the other. I crossed out bits on the first A4 (e.g. "everyone should have read the rules" -&gt; "Alex has read..." - my paraphrase) in thick black pen and added the date and a few bits of info  around the picture in felt tip, to turn the whole thing into an invitation. Even though I stressed that they were just there to glance at to get some familiarity with terms, in retrospect I shouldn't have included the rules.<br/></li><li>I met with Ed in the pub two days before we played, and brought the 5 questions along. After some small talk we took ten mins to talk through the questions and he generated quite a nifty character with just a little support from me. I said a very little about how to play  before that - you take on a character, I give adversity, play out a story where you think it's interesting, but was at pains to keep it minimal. It's not something you learn via explanation, and each set of players and dynamics generates a different play anyhoo.</li>
</ul><i>Something to note - for the other player, who lives further from me, I put the 5 questions up online, as well as Ed's character as food for thought.  I could have made them both do it online; that way they would have both got a chance to see each others character to inform their own choices. But I firmly believe this was the better way to go, and that social reality and comfort trumps game efficiency down the line.</i><br/><br/>Finally, the game took place in the building where Ed and I live, firmly on home turf. When we sat down to play, he knew none of the rules, had only just met the other participant, and had very little idea of what we were about to do. But by rendering this as what it actually was - a social occasion centred around a creative act - it wasn't a big deal.  The impressions I wanted to avoid were:"this is the beginning of a new era"; "I/you are at risk of being rejected"; "if you want to do this you have to succeed in entering this pre-existing social group". I think this worked pretty well.<br/><br/><br/>*Of course, undergoing the activity - being creative together - could very well change our friendship, by deepening and enriching it; that's part of my interest in playing with other people. But it's the activity that matters, not an agreement to get into the hobby, like a secret oath or some such.                        </div>

                            When I was playtesting The Roach I told some friends about it during a dinner date.  Describing the project drifted into a discussion of cool trends in RPG design, and they both said "we must try it!".  Neither was a gamer, but they were open to new stuff, so we did, and they were great, and it was a big success.  To my shame I hadn't considered asking them to play, even though I was glad to share my experiences over dinner.                        </div>

                            To me, it's kind of like fishing: you bait the hook, throw it in the lake, and wait until they bite before you try and reel them in.<br/><br/>In this case, the bait is mostly making them aware that hey, you play these games, and they're pretty fun.  Maybe it comes up in a conversation about leisure activities, maybe it's a tangent off a discussion about creative writing or cool TV shows/movies or something like that.  You give them an idea about how the games are played and what makes them fun, and you don't geek out at them (especially not in a "let me tell you all about my character" way) or put them on the spot about it.  If it sounds interesting to them, they'll ask you questions about it and make pleasant conversation.<br/><br/>Then when you've got a game lined up that's friendly to a new player (i.e., not overloaded with rules, not too weird, preferably a short-arc or one-shot scenario, in a genre/style that would seem to be a good match for them), you ask them if they'd like to give it a shot.  Most of the time you'll get results in between a cordial "well, that really wasn't my thing, but thanks anyway" to "when can we play again?".  (In my experience, it's been about a 30-70 split on that.)<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and then when you've got a good gaming group together, friends you like a lot and who you like playing with, you hang on to 'em like grim death so you don't have to go recruiting anymore.  ;-)                        </div>

                            D6 Star Wars is the BEST game for introducing new people.  Character creation is quick, the archetypes are ones everyone understands, the mechanics are simple and the universe is widely known.<br/><br/>I wish there was a LOTR game like that.<br/><br/>I ran a D6 Star Wars game for about ten college partygoers who weren't yet falling-down-drunk.  They had come to my dorm room saying, "Hey, Fred, run a game for us!"<br/><br/>They thought they would mock me.<br/><br/>Instead they had a ball.                        </div>

                            Hey, I'm necroposting here because I have news that <i>sort of</i> relates to this thread. See, after following the thread, I made a determination: to print up the Capes Lite material, assemble the necessary accessories (Poker Chips, <i>et al</i>). . .and carry it at the ready just like I do with board games, to be played at any social function where I can find willing participants.<br/><br/>And I did just that. Got some play in at <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22949.0" rel="nofollow">a New Years' Party</a>. Now, granted, this was a party full of "Game Geeks," and over half of my takers for Capes were from my regular roleplaying group. That's why I said it <i>sort of</i> relates. But the fact is, I'm determined to use Capes as a <i>game</i>, suitable to play with <i>any</i> of my friends who play <i>any</i> games. It just happens that the first one was with experienced RPGers. I plan to shop it around to anyone else who'll bite. If I get a nibble, I'll let y'all know how it goes.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            This usually works every time and the first 4 steps can all be done in one or multiple sitting...<br/>
<br/>
1. Start by playing Apples to Apples:<br/>
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/74" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/74</a><br/>
<br/>
2. Then play The Big Idea:<br/>
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/696" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/696</a><br/>
<br/>
3. Then play Once Upon a Time:<br/>
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1234" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1234</a><br/>
<br/>
4. If they are still interested, I will start with a low barrier to entry RPG like Dread:<br/>
<a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/products.php?publisherLink=impossibleDream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/products.php?publisherLink=impossibleDream</a><br/>
<br/>
I used to use PTA for this stage but I found starting with Dread first works since it requires less setup to start playing and the Jenga tower really focuses the players interest and attention.<br/>
<br/>
5. By this point they will either decide they would rather go back to an earlier game like Apples to Apples or they will be eager to push forward. If we continue, I will move on to either...<br/>
<br/>
Prime Time Adventures<br/>
<a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The Mountain Witch<br/>
<a href="http://www.timfire.com/MountainWitch.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.timfire.com/MountainWitch.html</a><br/>
<br/>
In addition to all of the above, it's important to focus the event as being a gathering of friends in a very social situation vs. just playing a game (for some reason many non gamers I've met think of video games when they think of getting together to play a game and often relate that being less of a social event and more of a focusing 100% on the game and nothing else). It helps if you have snacks, all go out together for food before or after playing, watch a movie, gossip, or whatever brings everyone together.                        </div>

                            Well, when I was a non-gamer, the way I was invited was that my friends Josh M. and Josh C. were looking for new players for a campaign Josh C. was planning, and Josh M. was like, "Kirsten reads all this stuff and plays video games, I bet she would be into it."  And then they invited me, and I said yes.  And then they created a monster.  But I'm probably not exactly what you mean by "non-gamers," since I always knew people who gamed and was sort of already steeped in the culture, so to speak.                        </div>

                            I once ran a one-shot for an entire high school class and their English professor (she agreed to this, so long as everyone spoke in English). <br><br>The game of choice was <i>Alta Inseguridad</i> ("High Insecurity"), a basic Spanish game with no fantasy or sci-fi elements. Because there were so many students, I divided the class into teams and gave a Player Character to each group. Each team made collective decisions about their character, with people taking turns to act as the PC's "voice".<br><br>The game began at a former professor's funeral (much laughter followed this description), and events quickly led to a murder mystery, complete with a corrupt businessman dumping toxic waste near a popular beach, an odd henchman chasing them, and a violent climax that ended with a rather happy ending.<br><br>All in all, some liked it more than others, but this was not a surprise. The team format was a novelty for me, but it worked out quite well. The story was something they could easily relate to, which was a big plus.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
