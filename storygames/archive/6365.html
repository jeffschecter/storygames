Her actual birthday is April 14, but for any number of reasons, we couldn\u2019t put together her party until then. It went really well, by the way. Lots of food and friends. Plus, shrimp!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at the end of the night, a few of us were left, having done cleanup duty, and it was time to bust out a game. There had been food, there had been drink, and <i>1001 Nights </i> seemed like a convivial way to end the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested, Crystal approved, and we were off to the races. Despite being interrupted a couple of times by children with nightmares\u2026or something\u2026I\u2019d say that the game was a success.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are our characters:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Malika the Sultan\u2019s new wife</b><br/>\nPlayed by Crystal<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing\u2014Sounds young<br/>\nSight\u2014Exquisite<br/>\nSmell\u2014like sweet fruit<br/>\nTaste\u2014Trained in high taste<br/>\nTouch\u2014soft like baby\u2019s skin<br/>\nClothing\u2014Royal rich satin white and pink kaftan and face veil<br/>\nEnvies\u2014<br/>\nRashid for his freedom to come and go and by respected<br/>\nAmira for being loved and respected for her talents instead of her appearance<br/>\nMelia for being wise and understanding people and the world<br/>\nAmbition\u2014to see the world<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Melia the seamstress</b><br/>\nPlayed by Raquel<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing\u2014I overhear conversations where no one realizes I\u2019m there<br/>\nSight\u2014I\u2019m often not seen even when I\u2019m in plain sight<br/>\nSmell\u2014I love the smell of flowers<br/>\nTaste\u2014I have simple tastes<br/>\nTouch\u2014I have sensitive fingers<br/>\nClothing\u2014a light gray thob\u2019ob<br/>\nEnvies\u2014<br/>\nRashid for being noticed when he walks past<br/>\nMalika for her beauty<br/>\nAmira for being surrounded by friends<br/>\nAmbition\u2014to gain social recognition at court<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rashid the Captain of the Guard</b><br/>\nPlayed by Seth<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing\u2014I jingle because I always wear mail<br/>\nSight\u2014All the women watch me as I walk by<br/>\nSmell\u2014I smell of oil and sweat<br/>\nTaste\u2014I love the taste of pistachios<br/>\nTouch\u2014My hands are rough from many hours of weapons drill<br/>\nClothing\u2014a turban wrapped around a spiked helm<br/>\nEnvies\u2014<br/>\nMalkia for her cultured upbringing<br/>\nMelia for her calm, unhurried life<br/>\nAmira for her infectious laugh<br/>\nAmbition\u2014to become a famous artist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b> Amira the Sultan\u2019s food taster</b><br/>\nPlayed by Gabrielle<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing\u2014Animated conversation<br/>\nSight\u2014I am a pleasant, round person<br/>\nSmell\u2014I smell of a kitchen<br/>\nTaste\u2014Epicurean taste.

It\u2019s all Color, but it\u2019s really good Color. Personally, I think the Envies are the crowning achievement of the game. Not only do they give context to our Courtiers\u2019 interactions, they are also a subtle method by which all the other players can add detail to my character. Of course, as I stressed last night, the Envies don\u2019t necessarily reflect reality, but they do reflect each character\u2019s <i>perception</i> of reality. Sometimes, that\u2019s more important.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140851/#Comment_140851" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-22T15:25:48+00:00" title="April 22, 2008  3:25PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>The Unfolding Stories</i><br/>\n<br/>\nActual game play was a hoot. Next time, I would like to start earlier to allow for more time spent in the Court. As it was, we probably spent half of our time playing out Court scenes and the other half playing through stories.  This was actually a bit different from what I was expecting. I was thinking that this would be more like <i>Baron Munchausen</i>, where the noble storytellers are really just an excuse for the stories to exist. In <i>1001 Nights</i>, the Courtiers really are the main characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, our unfolding story ended up centering on Malika, the Sultan\u2019s newest wife. In retrospect, I think that the other courtiers were all trying to position themselves as her closest friend. I don\u2019t even think that there was malice in it.  Well, except maybe for Rashid. He definitely had a thing for Malika.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we worked through the events that happened at court, we gradually found ourselves developing a rivalry between Rashid and Amira. At one point, Rashid even had his men instigate a brawl in the kitchens, thus attacking Amira\u2019s Ambition. I think that Rashid thought Amira was the one getting him in trouble with the Sultan (he racked up two reprimands; one more would have finished him). In fact, I think that we decided that Melia was the one who was passing word back to the Sultan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe storytelling was fairly easy, once we actually started doing it. The suggestion of starting off with a nursery rhyme or fairy tale that you already knew was really helpful. By the time that you give the situation a desert feel (e.g. Little Red Riding Hood turned into the story of the Red-Veiled Girl and the Desert Jackal) and assigned characters, you had already deviated from the original story enough that you weren\u2019t just retelling the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, betting Gems was really neat. Something that we started figuring out as we went is that there are essentially no dumb Gems. Because the Gem resolves when the event happens <i>or when it conclusively doesn\u2019t happen</i>, the Gems provided guidance by either \u201cattracting\u201d the story by players trying to make the event happen or by \u201crepelling\u201d the story by players trying to avoid that event. The more Gems, the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also liked the gamey nature of storytelling. I liked how the GM could pay to interrupt the story as a tactical move. In fact, of the three stories that we told, two of them were interrupted in this way: one because the GM had gotten really far ahead, and the other because the GM was getting left in the dust. This played well in the larger fiction as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Roleplaying games as party games</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOf late, I\u2019ve been thinking about roleplaying games that fit into different time and commitment slots than the traditional \u201cone-shot\u201d or \u201ccampaign\u201d models. <i>1001 Nights</i> seems to fit this mold. In general, the rules are few, and they can be taught as the game is played. Since character creation is entirely Color, there\u2019s no need to explain strategy at the beginning of the game, making it quite accessible for new players. In fact, I would be interested in giving this game a whirl as the central event of a party. It would probably be a simple matter to stage, and it could be a lot of fun. The forthcoming <i>A Penny for My Thoughts</i> by Paul Tevis would qualify here as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I\u2019m curious. Are there other games available that fit into this mold?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Conclusion</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>1001 Nights</i> doesn\u2019t seem to get a lot of love on the Internet. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad game. Actually, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a good game. It was a fun, relaxing, non-controversial way to spend an evening. It\u2019s hard to say much more than \u201cWe had fun!\u201d But that seems to be a ringing endorsement to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and by the way, did everyone notice that I did roleplaying and there was nothing controversial? Yeah, it can happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth Ben-Ezra<br/>\nGreat Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

The first layer is the players playing the Courtiers. This is mostly freeform. Then the Courtiers tell stories. One of them is essentially the GM for the story, with the other Courtiers taking the roles of the main characters. That's right: you're roleplaying characters that are roleplaying.

So, my friends asked them if they wanted to play. Of the couple, he had played only a little D&amp;D years before, and she never played a rpg before.<br><br>So I had to explain the rules to four people, not two, two of which weren't there for the game but only to see friends and played only for courtesy. I had never player the game myself until then, only read the rule. I was prepared to have the first session be difficult (as often the first session of a new game is) even without the complication.<br><br>The result? the couple enjoyed very much the game, as everybody else at the table, and even stayed late because the game still wasn't finished. Many rpgs are very easy to learn, but this game is very easy to _teach_!
