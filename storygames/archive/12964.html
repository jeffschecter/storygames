The expedition leader's ontological problem has epistemological roots, which is cool.<br/><br/>Key 17, from "The Invisibles", is a substance that causes people to be unable to distinguish between symbols and their referents. You hold up a piece of paper with the word "LION" written on it to a person dosed with Key 17, and they yell "JESUS CHRIST" and get in the car. Taking Key 17 breaks the use/mention distinction and gives you an epistemological problem.<br/><br/>Among Deadpool's powers: he can see through the fourth wall. He knows he's in a comic book. He can see the speech bubbles and narration boxes, and occasionally uses this to his advantage, but mostly just exploits it for humor. She-Hulk has a similar power but it's handled differently. That's interesting because of the possibility of recursion, among other things. Deadpool, in particular, introduces observer problems, and questions of the inevitability of the future for fictional characters (you can't foreshadow something in the narration boxes without him knowing about it and maybe trying to do something about it, for instance).

They even had superpower rules in one of the supplements. It had the feel of combining Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Star Wars, Star Trek, and Spitting Image (the British caricature puppets).<br/><br/>Now that I have a better idea of what these other things are that you reference, as well as to what thematic end, it still might be a good choice. Floating Vagabond makes a point to exploit these concepts. The various special abilities, even in just the main book, would serve your needs well. It is a lot more on the side of slapstick, but could easily be toned down to a more subltle level.<br/><br/>Mechanically, Floating Vagabond might not be as user-friendly (wasn't bad, but one of the few games I've seen requiring a D30...which I have since stocked up on). But the concepts and abilities could easily be ported to some other system (my thoughts? Using the old Ghostbusters rules...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292287/#Comment_292287" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T13:22:25+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  1:22PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a standard Over the Edge campaign.

Basically, I can't think of any games that specifically drive towards that level of meta-play (well, maybe Power Kill), but going there is definitely easier with a game that gives players a lot of narrative power, or characters so much cosmic power that it basically operates on a narrative level.  Something where players are actively declaring plot points would work, like Houses of the Blooded (which, now that I think about it, has subsystems that involve players managing their PCs' territory via a Settlers of Catan-ish board game, and characters writing plays that give the viewers new Aspects).  <br/><br/>Baron Munchausen would be another good choice, since the players are playing characters telling one another tall tales, and interrupt one another IC to establish troublesome details that must be incorporated or disputed ("But Baron, how could the mad monk Rasputin have possibly smelled your cologne when I happen to have his nose here in my pocket as a dueling trophy?").  Isn't there a more directly Scheherazade-inspired game or two out there too?<br/><br/>Weapons of the Gods also sort of flirts with this in spots, since the basis of the Secret Arts (essentially, granting people advantages or disadvantages on the fly) is one of narrative convenience-- the difficulty of inflicting penalties for blinding rage on an irate shopkeeper is vastly lower than trying to do the same thing to a calm, reserved judge.  Experience points, alignment, and character levels all exist as in-character concepts to varying degrees, and there is a special "transcendent" kind of XP that lets you buy things the normal variety can't-- the gaining and use of which is viewed as an affront to the natural order of things.  Also, the supplement has large-scale conflict rules that are explicitly modeled on a board game that exists in the setting.<br/><br/>The new edition of HeroQuest uses narrative-based difficulty (basically, the difficulty of doing anything is completely divorced from the task itself; it begins as a set number, and rises and falls as the PCs either succeed or fail at individual rolls.  So crossing the same river or climbing the same wall could be harder or easier depending on when in the story it happens), and has the ability to "zoom in" to a conflict (i.e., resolve it in more or fewer rolls) depending on how narratively important it is.  Making the characters explicitly aware of this might have some interesting consequences, especially since the game uses freeform traits, so a character could easily have "Knowledge of comedic tropes" or "Has a copy of the script" and use that to augment their more mundane skills.<br/><br/>Finally, Exalted has touches of this kind of thing in the setting, since characters are aware of certain rules constructs existing in-game and could arguably deduce many others from the evidence they canonically have, but even the people that like the game admit the rules are so fatally broken that the most successful way to play involves avoiding reasons to roll dice, so I'd look somewhere else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292326/#Comment_292326" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T15:24:55+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  3:24PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Dungeons and Discourse (Dresden Codak)</blockquote>\nWhen the first one came out, the best way I saw to play out the philosophical one-upmanship show in the comic was with a Dogs in the Vineyard-like resolution mechanic (i.e. characters have Traits like Cartesian Dualism 2d8 that they roll in conflicts.
