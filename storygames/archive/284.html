<p>Okay, so I'm a bad monkey: these notes should have been posted as we played.  Instead they're three weeks later, and so they're going to revolve mostly around my impressions from running the game, and I'll hope that maybe the players will fill in their experiences.</p>
<p>Short summary of the Town: woman miscarries, and afraid to conceive again spurns her husband, who seeks the attentions of another girl, which gets the wife jealous so she seduces a farmhand and gets him to kill her hubby and move in.  Steward is a little older than he ought to be.</p>
<p>The resolution, as I recall it was that the farmhand got pressed into service to the Dogs, the wife was adopted into the family of her husbands mistress, and the Steward and his family were exiled.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, all of that was neat, but not as cool as what we saw along the way.  First, I got a stellar showing in terms of PCs, in terms of the Mountain People raised guy who wanted everything to turn out okay; the Feral Two Legged Dog who was there to provide the righteous leadership people need; the better-than back Easter; and the son of a TA official, who's salient trait was "Expedience."</p>
<p>Three things were particularly stand-out for me in running Dogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of my players has an intensity in play that can be kind of scary, and I'm looking forward to playing with him more in the hope that it'll rub off.  But the rules meant that it didn't get him anything.  If he wanted results, he needed to put forward dice.  That was a really interesting, since we were both unconciously used to a paradigm of credence being granted by <em>convincing</em> the GM.  In Dogs, you can do all the convincing you like, but you've got to back it with dice.</p></li>
<li><p>"Everything needs to work out," "People need to be led," and "expedience" was a inter-player conflict waiting to happen.  And it did.  In spades.  The majority of the last session was playing out a sequence of three conflicts about what was going to happen with the seduced killer.  And it happened smoothly, and with a minimum of fuss.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I feel like I'm shirking when I GM Dogs.  Sure, I did a certain amount of prep work, but it's mostly pretty sketchy, and the town creation rules make it pretty easy to do.  But once I'm at the table, I don't do any <em>work.</em>  I say yes or roll dice; I don't make any judgements about credibility, really, and I don't have to push the plot around.  It's like being transfered from the Hippo Herding Department to the green at the Kentucky Derby.  I kept saying to myself, I like where this is going, and it's certainly tearing up the track, but I don't feel like I'm working very hard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two things that continue to give me trouble with Dogs, though.  One is that the dice system is very there.  It's fun, and it works, but it's a little jarring to be thinking about how the dice influence what you can say next.  The other problem, and it only really occured late in this town, was that I found myself setting up conflicts (the Steward doesn't want to tell you that) only to give in the first or second round (well, in that case, sure...)</p>
<p>All in all, very good fun, and I still am fascinated by Dogs as a system and as a game.</p>

                            Oh, Hester had miscarried?  I don't think we ever got that part.  We just labeled her a harlot and moved on. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>On Dice -- I find the dice as an interesting constraint to work within.  However, this requires me to roll-spend-narrate rather than narrate-roll-spend (as it appears in the book).  I like to have the "freedom" to say, "You know, this thing I'm doing?  It's only so-so."  And then put out a raise of six.  There aren't many games that allow you to be half-hearted about things without giving you a stiff penalty.<br/><br/>On Short Conflicts -- as long as the players are engaged for that one round of raise and see, I don't think you've got a problem.  We're trying to implement this in our online Dogs group -- shorter conflicts, more frequent gives, more follow-ups.  Not every conflict has to go for rounds and rounds and rounds -- and in fact, if all your conflicts are going forever, you're probably setting stakes too high.                        </div>

<p>Well, yeah, she miscarried.  It never really came up, since you guys weren't so interested in her reasons.  I seem to remember there not being a whole lot of interest in mitigating situations, etc.  But that's how Dogs works.</p>
<p>I actually do like the "well, I really only have a 4 to raise with, so I guess I say something like 'Yeah, and you mother, too!'"  or "Hell, if I'm raising with a 10, this had better be good."  But that's also two very different frames of mind: "how effective is my next move" and the "how do I narrate what my guy does."</p>
<p>Yeah, short conflicts worked pretty well.  I think I just got a little worried about them, especially since they were very often "Oh, I guess he does give." type Gives.</p>

                            Any good games needs an auto-correct feature that allows you to try something, realize it's a bad idea, and stop it -- preferably without saying, "Okay, that last half hour?  Forget it, it never happened."  Finding out that the character gives on a conflict is one of those.  It's a good thing, IMHO.                        </div>

                            I'll agree with Josh on that one. <br/><br/>Also, sometimes those second go Gives are just a reward for good play by one of the players -- or a reaction to the way their character handled the situation. <br/><br/>I had a situation recently where an NPC was trying to hide in his house to keep from talking to the Dogs. It went to conflict, and I was thinking of this longer conflict in which the Dogs chased him from room to room and such, when one of the PCs kicked down the door, pulled out her scriptures, and made a raise such that if the character had seen it he would have become forever after a complete spineless pissant. <br/><br/>As I couldn't make the character a complete spineless pissant (just a partial one), I had to give. <br/><br/>If the PCs had gone at it differently the contest could have gone longer. But when they hit that perfect pitch, the glass is gonna shatter. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I've also noticed that some groups of Dogs have no interest in mitigating circumstances, where as other groups do. One of my current favorite games (as I have more than one Dogs group) is to play the same town with different groups to see what happens. So far no town has turned out even remotly the same with any different group.                        </div>
