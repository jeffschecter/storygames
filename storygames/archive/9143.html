An inspired name for the ship's robot, quirky but fits somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding PDQ#, I've only had experience of the earlier versions of PDQ which use 2d6 for every roll. Initially I figured it was pretty finely tuned to encourage a swashbuckling tone, but your game made me rethink.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did you find Duel-level conflicts played out in a sci-fi setting? The whole thing about dividing 3d6 into attack and defence seems very three musketeers/swashbucklery to me, and a departure in feel from earlier PDQ incarnations. Did you find that this coloured your game, or did it fit the sci-fi setting pretty well?<br/>\n<br/>\nI never quite picked out the importance of Techniques reading through PDQ# - looks like they do a good job of character niche protection, among other things, and make each crew member a specialist in their field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202682/#Comment_202682" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T14:07:55+00:00" title="April 19, 2009  2:07PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2009 2:09PM by JuddG.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adrian P</cite>How did you find Duel-level conflicts played out in a sci-fi setting?</blockquote>\nWe had three duels total. Two with the pirate mook mobs and one with the Gel Cube.  In each case, the division was less about swordsmanship tactics and more about how careful are you being as opposed to how all-out you are to do some harm.  It was a risk/reward thing.  The fact that the weapons were blasters was less important than how much cover was being taken vs how many rounds you put down-range.  I think the division of concentration was pretty clear in player's concepts of what the choice meant in the fiction.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adrian P</cite>I never quite picked out the importance of Techniques reading through PDQ# - looks like they do a good job of character niche protection, among other things, and make each crew member a specialist in their field.</blockquote>\nTechniques reward players for playing to niche and idiom.  This had some delightful consequences in some cases, as "Homeboy" (whose player wanted to hate the nickname that the Captain gave him) was cheerfully announcing his threats as he returned fire on Pirates and such.  Other things like the fact that the pilot gets tech points when he is the calm one in a sea of chaos give the character a defined handle for their portrayal that is rewarded in the mechanical side.<br/><br/>I think the genre assumptions in PDQ# are partially because of the way the rules are communicated.  By renaming the Swashbuckling traits as "Heroic" traits helped the players engage in the idea that those traits were their cinematic action-shot traits (the thing the producer would call them in a pitch meeting).<br/><br/>I got several comments from players afterward that a great deal of fun was had.  It was also a very unforced session, and didn't feel like work at any point, which is how I judge a good game system from the GM chair.  The game also played fast and let players have some freedom of options, even while shielding their niches, which is what I look for on the player side of the table as well.<br/><br/>We meet monthly, so I will have the second session up once we get it played out.  Thanks for the comments!<br/><br/>(edit: spelling fix...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205048/#Comment_205048" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-03T14:14:41+00:00" title="May  3, 2009  2:14PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second session write-up <a href="http://www.juddgoswick.com/PDQ/SciFi-SessionTwo.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a>  The game played much faster and some non-minions upped the ante in combats.<br/><br/>Also: a big musical number and some damn fine catharsis from the demon game we are playing this to lay to rest!

This one didn't run very smoothly because the scenario has the players confused as to what to do.  This is likely because I have put too many chefs in the stew of the local star system and the quest to recover and deal with the alien tech the players are stuck with.<br/><br/>Check it out <a href="http://www.juddgoswick.com/PDQ/SciFi-SessionThree.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>Another thing that scares me is that the players may be (via some illusionism) trying to decode what I "expect" them to do and each new revelation may be creating a false signal to them...  I seriously hope this is not the issue.  If it is, I am not sure they will ever figure out what they want to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
