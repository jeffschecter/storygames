I'm wondering if anyone can weigh in with <i>actual play experiences</i> of 30 sessions or more in an indie game.<br/><br/>My guess is that most indie games have never had more than 30 sessions of continuous play, and I'm zeroing in on Universalis, Primetime Adventures, and Mortal Coil especially since I wish I could find such an account but haven't had any luck with that.  <br/><br/>I'd love to be proven wrong.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106911/#Comment_106911" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T22:45:04+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 10:45PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            30 Sessions, no.  I've run a a 15 episode run of Primetime Adventures.  I ran a 9 town run of Dogs in the Vineyard that averaged 2 sessions a town so that's 18 sessions.  A full game of Burning Empires is estimated to be run at 18-20 sessions but I've never personally done that.  Most of my Sorcerer games run 4 to 8 sessions apiece and I've run the game 3 or 4 times but not as a consecutive storyline.  I ran a Riddle of Steel game for what seemed like a REALLY long time but I didn't keep track of the sessions, so don't have that data on hand.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106912/#Comment_106912" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T23:15:34+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 11:15PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My longest run of an indie game is 7 sessions (IIRC) of Prime Time Adventures.

And you know what?  I kinda like it that way.  But the interesting thing is that Claire really likes the idea of settling into a more longterm campaign where she gets to play the same character for a longer period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106923/#Comment_106923" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T01:45:00+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  1:45AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Rich,</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>but I have certain doubts about what they can do</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>isn't a particularly ambiguous phrasing to me, and "I have certain doubts about what people in fact do with them" is not among its interpretations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106925/#Comment_106925" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T02:15:36+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  2:15AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The R2R system used for Aeternal Legends has been used by up to four different groups at once for over three years.

And it's not because of the games, it's because of the players.  I've always been a "kid in the candyshop" as you put it.  I've never run 30 sesssions of <i>anything</i>. D&amp;D, White Wolf, nothing. I've never even been in a game where we played 30 sessions of a single game.  Well, there might be one exception, but that was when I was in Junior college and two friends and I got together every single week to play a D&amp;D game. That might have lasted longer than 30 weeks.  I still don't think so.<br/><br/>There is an element of the game, too.  But I couldn't imagine playing the Men In Black RPG for more than 30 sessions (and it's a fun game). Nor Call of Cthulhu, or most horror games, for that matter. I think many HERO and GURPS fans have more fun playing in multiple short form settings than an extended campaign.<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with whether the game is indie or not.  Sometime it has to do with whether the game is designed for it, but a vast majority of the time it has to do with the players. Most people playing indie games (especially people involved in general purpose boards like this) are looking for a lot of variety in what they play. If I had a lot of time to game, I'd definitely start up a long term HeroQuest or Spirit of the Century game. But I don't, so I keep my games small and focused so we can try something else in the pile of books that I have yet to play (or want to play more of).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107022/#Comment_107022" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T11:10:47+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 11:10AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I'm wondering if anyone can weigh in with <i>actual play experiences</i> of 30 sessions or more in an indie game. ...

When my gaming group played GURPS all the live long day, we still changed it up after 8 or so sessions, because we had three or four GMs in a group of six to seven people, and even when we gamed two nights every-other-week, we still wanted to change it up -- horror for this campaign, swashbuckling fantasy after that, etc.  I can't remember the last time I played in a game that lasted over 10 sessions.<br/><br/>I think that Spirit of the Century (or other FATE setups) could do long-term play, though it wouldn't be the same long-term play as, say, Burning Wheel or TSoY.  I'm certain games Burning Wheel &amp; TSoY could handle the length, though I am as likely to play a 10-session BW game as I am a 10-session A Penny For My Thoughts game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107026/#Comment_107026" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T11:24:54+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 11:24AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite> I've never even been in a game where we played 30 sessions of a single game. </blockquote>\nOur WoD: Paris game lasted 54 sessions!<br/><br/>How quickly they forget... <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107028/#Comment_107028" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T11:39:38+00:00" title="November  6, 2007 11:39AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played D&amp;D for well over 30 sessions on multiple occassions.

For some, yes, but not all. Just take the notion of playing in a setting again and apply it to characters too. A lot of times setting has elements left open to be explored. So do characters. Sometimes characters end up with a complete resolution that forcing a continuation rings false. Sometimes setting are so fleshed out there's no room to explore without breaking it (like Middle Earth, I'd say).<br/><br/>And then there's a difference between open ended and a 3, or 5, or 7, or 12 novel series. You can still aim for closed fiction form, and play a game that lasts a very long time (how many sessions in a novel is also something to consider.)<br/><br/>I think Ben has a good point, though. RPGs have been generally set up to be open ended serials (or perhaps a long series of novels). So it's nice to have ones that don't try to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_107308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107308/#Comment_107308" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-07T18:18:36+00:00" title="November  7, 2007  6:18PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2007 7:09PM by droog.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Fiction does not necessarily have a significant ending, even highly character-centric fiction.

Later on we began to resolve conflicts more quickly as they occured. <br/><br/>We found that we preserved resolution over deferral. As a result we are moving to play shorter games.

It's possible for them to get the whole treat in the short-form ... that's what makes the rapid-fire greed possible.  There's no phrase "kid in a Dostoevsky-novel shop," and for good reason.<br/><br/>I don't think I've <i>ever</i> had a thirty session campaign of <i>Monopoly</i>, for instance ... one completed session leaves me sated, without much desire to extend that experience further.
