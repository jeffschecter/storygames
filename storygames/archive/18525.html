In the type of game that Monsterhearts is, I would expect "stealing the show" to happen thanks to player skills (good narrative flow, lots of ideas, no hesitation in jumping in, knows how to use the rules) more than the specific crunch they've got.

It skeeves me out a little, but that might be just me.<br/><br/>While what Eero says has sometimes been true in my experience also, I could envisage some moves effectively enabling a player to do preferential scene framing, or inserting their character into other scenes, grabbing extra spotlight (presuming a game like *W where it is supposed to be distributed somewhat equitably).  Still needs player initiative, though, and I'm not sure if the Succubus has those anyway.<br/><br/>In regards the Succubus being mechanically powerful, as an example, their core move lets them offer a voucher good for one 10+ auto-success to another character, <i>gaining a String</i> in the bargain, <i>and</i> marking XP, at no cost or risk to themselves- no roll required or price to be paid.   That feels like three (kind of unferal) moves right there, but no, you still get to pick two more.<br/><br/>I know the MC is supposed to be a fan of the characters, but in my opinion the designer is too much of a fan of this Skin.<br/><br/>(edited for grammar and sense)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416819/#Comment_416819" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T08:34:32+00:00" title="June 22, 2013  8:34AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does seem a lot, but the main thing it does is help other people get what they want with no/little cost, so it's kind of a support skin.

I got more than double the experience in this session than any other player.<br/><br/>The Succubus can accumulate strings like crazy, uses them to greater effect and stacks them with (potentially) both take-forward and a condition from the other moves. With a stock pile of strings, and a few deals made for Gifts, it seemed like there was almost nothing I couldn't do. <br/><br/>My personal play style is rather assertive, so... I dunno. I don't feel that's a problem, but if there is an asymmetry between the play styles at the table, I can see how these mechanical concerns would come out.

Gaining a string and marking XP from the same move is not the move of a support skin.<br/><br/>I hadn't thought about adding more XP- but if done it should be available to all.

The Vampire player requires them the target to have no strings on them. String generation moves are included in many skins and a savvy player who fears loss of agency or is in fear of the Vamp player abusing their power can always ensure that they keep at least a sting on the Vamp rendering them immune to Hypnotize. In addition, if you are playing a skin that has no inherent String generation moves (apart from the Basic Moves) and wish the Vamp to not have that kind of hold over you. You can always use one of your Background Strings to ensure immunity.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416914/#Comment_416914" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T14:44:41+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  2:44PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 2:50PM by Cneph.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, but not every player thinks about the game in that way or is even aware of the Hypnotic move in someone else's Skin.  Not all  characters will have (selected) String generation moves and characters don't necessarily start with a String on the Vampire.  Plus, they don't get the full benefit of their moves if they have to hold on to a String defensively.  So if you are dissatisfied with the move, these are fairly weak mitigations, as in if you don't/can't hold a String, the move is just as (over)powerful- there is no means to soften the effects of a hit.<br/>As an example of a softer version, you could replace the effect on PCs with 'If they do what you want, they mark XP.  If they refuse, they gain the condition <i>mesmerised</i>'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ishnub" title="Ishnub"><img alt="Ishnub" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ishnub">Ishnub</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416921/#Comment_416921" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-23T17:13:07+00:00" title="June 23, 2013  5:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2013 5:15PM by Ishnub.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you are saying. However, all players still have access to Turning Someone On, Shutting Someone Down and Lashing Out Physically. As means to generate Strings. You don't need  Skin specific String generation moves to gain Strings on people. Generating Strings in build into many of the Basic Moves.<br/><br/>A Vampire with Hypnotic can screw with you, they can generate drama which is a good thing (most likely not for your character but great as a player) but it will precipitate action of some sort, which is at the heart of MH anyways, but it's not like they can kill you or anything since you have control over that aspect. And once they have played their Hypnotizing card, even a player who is unaware of the Move to begin with is then aware and good luck pulling that same card a second time. Telling someone to jump off a building is tantamount to declaring war on that person with everything it entails and all the delicious dramariffic fallout that will follow. And the most fun I've had in MH is when players goals are at odds with each other. When the PC's unite to a common goal the systems pretty much ensures that nothing will stand in their way. At least not for long. <br/><br/>And while yes, having to keep a String in reserve to mitigate a power sucks and does make the String not fulfill it's purpose in game it still serves a role in game. That of denying the Vampire control over you.<br/><br/>But really, we've strayed from the original topic of the Succubus and it's power level and moves. I'll agree that Hypnotic is powerful but it's power can be pretty easily mitigated by PCs. NPCs are another matter entirely but they are stolen cars anyways so don't really matter except in how they affect the players and their relations to them. The move can generate drama and conflict which is great IMO. An adversarial group of players may not be to your liking though, and that's okay, to each their own.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/quincunx" title="quincunx"><img alt="quincunx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/quincunx">quincunx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417003/#Comment_417003" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-24T15:32:40+00:00" title="June 24, 2013  3:32PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys-<br/><br/>I'd really like to hear more about anybody's experience trying to address these concerns with the Succubus.

There are a few thoughts upthread, but it seems very unclear is there is any consensus about this allegedly overpowered business.<br/><br/>Thank you so much!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
