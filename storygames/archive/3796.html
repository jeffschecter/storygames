It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting book. In the first chapter Wolk raises several points that I think have strong parallels with RPGs, story games and things that the Forgr/indie/story games communities have been talking about a lot ove the last few months. Here are 4 separate bits from the first chapter. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll let you draw your own conclusions. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll just say this: there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s certainly value in making and learning from mistakes. But isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t it wise to look at the mistakes of our older brother and try to avoid them?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jake (also posted on my blog here: http://jake-richmond.livejournal.com/25325.html)<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\u0153Any art with a bygone golden age is doomed to try to repeat it, and to repeat its failings. The big problem with the idea of the Silver Age is that, by definition, the Golden Age is follows is lost, and the people who use that name are working from the assumption that the gold belongs in the past. The cartoonists of the 30s and 40s and early 50s were, for the most part, desperate, underpaid kids and sleazy entrepreneurs. Sometimes they managed to make crudely powerful imagination bombs anyway, and a small handful of them were ahead of their time;  they knew they could fob off any old thing on the children who were their audience- and did. All of them left their mark on the next generation of cartoonists, though, because they were the Ancients. For the next couple of decades comics either imitated the Golden Age\xe2\u20ac\u2122s artistic and storytelling strategies, developed improvements on them, or (occasionally) rebelled against them.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\u0153From then until the turn of the millennium, those three books (Dark Knight, Watchmen and Maus) became the standard against which comics that wanted to be important or meaningful were measured and the standard to which too many cartoonists who wanted to create something important or meaningful (but didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know how) aspired.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\u0153Another common error is to assert that highbrow comics are, somehow, not really comics but something else (preferably with a fancier name) \xe2\u20ac\u201cdifferent not just in breed but in species from their mass-cultural namesakes. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a certain nose-in-the-air  class consciousness inherent in this particular argument.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\u0153If you try to draw a boundary that includes everything that counts as comics and excludes everything that doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t, two things happen: first, the medium always wriggles across that boundary, and second, whatever politics are implicit in the definition always boomerang on the definer.\xe2\u20ac\x9d                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85184/#Comment_85184" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T00:50:13+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 12:50AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heheh.

Which is interesting.  I think the lesson here (for me) is that things that I see as a problem aren't necessarily seen as one by everyone (or anyone) else, or (more often) seen as a different kind of problem. In any cae, I've gotten some interestin discussion out of these passages, and as I continue to read the book I'm drawing more and more obvious parallels, not just with the text but with my own experiences as both a comics reader and artist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85556/#Comment_85556" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T13:50:29+00:00" title="August  4, 2007  1:50PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reading it as well and it (with some help) is already getting me into some <a href="http://ogrecave.com/2007/08/03/taste-the-fearsome-beak-of-critical-standards/#comments" rel="nofollow">great arguments</a><a>.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85558/#Comment_85558" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T14:19:41+00:00" title="August  4, 2007  2:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a good one.

Actually, I'd say that the book has very, very little to do with the arguments you've gotten yourself into.  You've mentioned it once directly by way of example, sure, but I do think the reactions you've been getting have more to do with tone of writing and being open to criticism all around than the book at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85566/#Comment_85566" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T15:32:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2007  3:32PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's informing my position, is all.
