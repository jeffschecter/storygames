For those of you who may not know what Boarsdraft is let me give you the elevator pitch. Boarsdraft is a game where you play young witches and wizards, making friends, learning spells and fighting evil. If that interests you come check out <a href="http://atthetablegames.com/?p=86" rel="nofollow">Boarsdraft</a>!<br/><br/>For those of you who have heard of Boarsdraft and may have played it already, much of the core ideas are still the same. There are some pretty drastic changes in some areas and some more subtle changes in others. The feedback I have gotten from my first round of playtests has been fantastic and very useful. I'm very much looking forward to seeing and hearing how the changes work out in the wild.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
