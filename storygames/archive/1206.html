                    How do you guys feel about props and stuff other than dice(or cards or whatever) and paper in a game? <br/>
<br/>
Theres all kinds of examples of this, from miniatures to prop-guns to Larp style costuming and heavy theming of the room. <br/>
<br/>
How do you think this affects the game? Good? bad? Dangerous? <br/>
<br/>
How about music or sound effects? Since that is becoming more and more of a realistic option, with laptops and huge hard drives. <br/>
<br/>
I would like specific examples if at all possible. <br/>
<br/>
I am sure this has been discussed before, please point me to any threads or links you find appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx <br/>

                            There was a good long discussion about tactile appeal during games a few weeks ago <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=839" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I'm not fond of anything much beyond dice, paper and miniatures. Anything else, in my opinion, is a distraction. I like my players to be "in the zone" as much as possible during a game, not necessarily in character or immersed, but definitely focusing on the game itself. I feel that too much extra stuff beyond that distracts them too much, and causes them to focus too much on the props than on the game itself ...                        </div>

                            Oh and this:
<blockquote>How about music or sound effects? Since that is becoming more and more of a realistic option, with laptops and huge hard drives.</blockquote>
I don't think this topic has been specifically addressed yet. Wanna discuss it here?  If so, either you or I could Edit your post to change the topic to "Character Theme Songs" or "Music in RPGs" or whatever.<br/><br/>FOr the most part, I'm iffy on music at gaming. Half the time it enhances the game, half the time it is totally distracting.<br/><br/>No fucking Conan soundtrack. It is awesome, but so distracting that you might as well have the TV on and a toddler dancing on your dice.<br/><br/>Other times, the rule is pretty much "any genre is fine, as long as it's background music and can't really be heard too well". I personally prefer songs without words.<br/><br/>Ambient, techno, new age, experimental/space music (steve roach, lisa gerrard), some classical and the like have been very successful for us.  I playtested my Emo Monster Hunting game at Jason's house, and he played really otherwise distracting Russian Rap-Rock which TOTALLY enhanced the mood for some unknown reason. <br/><br/>It depends on the game, the mood, the tastes of the players, and just fate sometimes. For me, anyway. You all?                        </div>

                            I can't stand music when I play.  The hostess of my current group is always, always, always playing some kind of music, and even when it fits the game, it's simply distracting and irritating as all hell.  I'm always asking her to turn it down or off or whatever.<br/><br/>Total game-killer for me.<br/><br/>As for the rest...

                            I used to make mix-tapes and burn CDs to match the games I was running; in the last big game I ran, I actually had a couple playlists on iTunes that I switched through for different moods (fight! suspense! mystery! awe!).  The playlists were actually kind of distracting in the end, though.                        </div>

                            Once upon a time I ran a Silent Hill / Little Fears game. It ran in a closed story arc of five sessions.<br/>
<br/>
We played in the basement, lit by a bare lightbulb. I sat my players in oversized armchairs. To each one I gave a signature prop, prompted by the Little Fears character sheet: an action figure, a stuffed dog, a stuffed bear, a special handkerchief. I allowed no food, but did offer pitchers of Kool-Aid and big heavy tumblers.<br/>
<br/>
I prepared playlists of Silent Hill background music on a nearby PC: one low-tension playlist, and one high-tension extra-disturbing playlist that I used for the Dark World.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids found a discarded walkie-talkie near a crash site, I handed the players a walkie-talkie. I had its twin rigged to transmit static when I needed to imply that there were monsters getting close.<br/>
<br/>
Every time they saw a new monster, I had a big sketch of it prepared on 12" x 18" paper -- all scribbly, in black charcoal and red crayon. I taped the sketches to the wall behind me where the play. By the end of the game, the wall was covered in the monsters they had seen.<br/>
<br/>
One session ran in a Silent Hill hotel. In one room, the kids found a TV that randomly turned on. I prepared a real TV in the basement to turn on, muted, via remote at that moment; I had it playing the final scenes from the Shining.<br/>
<br/>
One session ran in a Silent Hill pet store. I prepared a scene where a girl's favorite stuffed dog would get shot. I said that in-game there was blood, and that the girl could feel a bullet in the stuffed dog's head. The player, cradling her stuffed-dog prop, declared that she had to get the bullet out. So I slid a real pair of scissors to her and nodded at the dog, telling her: "You <i>really do</i> feel a bullet in there." So the player cut the dog's head open with the scissors, pushed her hand inside and found the stuffing wet with red food coloring I'd slid inside with the bullet the night before. She went home with red stains on her hands.<br/>
<br/>
The players still talk about that game today, four years later.<br/>
<br/>
Four keys that made it work:<br/>
<br/>
One, it was a brand-new player group. Nobody knew how I'd GM.<br/>
Two, we nonetheless had a good Social Contract conversation up-front (before I knew what Social Contract was), establishing simply that we were there to play a scary horror game, so no wrecking the mood.<br/>
Three, the game had a huge amount of GM Fiat. I railroaded like a ninja master, so they never noticed, but how else was I to get them into all my cool scary moments?<br/>
And Four -- I was unemployed. There's no way I could pull off all that prep these days!                        </div>

                            All one would need would be an array of <a href="http://www.gotfuturama.com/Multimedia/MP3Sounds/Zapp_and_Kif_SoundBoard.shtml" rel="nofollow">soundboards</a>.  There have been incidents where radio DJs use similar devices to hold prank phone calls with people.

                            I used to be heavy into this and it just never worked for me.  I remember running a one-shot about the crew of a B-17 - I had three different computers going, sampled engine noise loops, technical manuals for describing damage, all kinds of immersive craziness.  In the end it didn't add enough to be worth the effort.  We didn't have any more fun than we would have had without all the prep.  The thing we still remember about that session is the dinner we had together before play.                        </div>

I gotta admit, from the outside, I like watching people playing dress-up Vampire. TO me, it reinforces the genre convention of vampires being hyper-social, hyper-political (in some fiction), and yet... they are always a little out of their time. They look at themselves, look at each other, and think that 1700s Baton Rouge clothing is just as acceptable as jeans and a T-Shirt. I think that's kinda telling to the "vampire psych". Whether the players use that in their adaptations or not is another matter.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>

                            I've had numerous complaints from players about the use of mood music for games and abandoned its use.  It worked for one campaign, and that was the end of that, it never worked again.  For horror games I have made collages from various magazine ads and articles that occassionally the PCs would run across and it served well in my goal of disturbing them.  Lighting is a really good option from what I have seen.  This can significantly effect mood and immersion, without breaking the concentration of a large percentage of your participants.<br/>

<p>To borrow Paul's device, why hasn't anybody mentioned <em>Agon</em> yet?</p>
<p>I will do so.</p>
<p>You said, "other than dice" but I don't think it matters here; it's intuitive and weighty. I <em>feel</em> the strength of my attacks; a d4 is lighter, less significant than a d8. It is profound.</p>

                            1001 Nights is all over the props. Silk scarves, brass bowls, dice that make you think of gems and want to touch them, a menu in the game, etc.,etc. I seriously think bringing in actual tactile, sensual experience helps a game. Theme music that's not fiddley or intrusive can be fantastic. <br><br>I remember vividly the props Vincent used for our awesome Cyberpunk campain in college, often involving burnt matches and broken glass and red watercolors as a centerpiece. A centerpiece provides focus, something to rest your eyes on and think about when it's not your turn to talk. If this centerpiece keeps you engaged in the activity, so much the better. I'd love to be in a vampire game that had a pile of dark earth on the table - lots to think about there.                        </br></br></div>

                            In several years I have not run a game that did not have a soundtrack with character theme songs et all. There is an art to using a soundtrack, however, and it takes practice to keep it from being distracting. (As with scene framing its something you can get cues for by watching how they make it work in movies.) I find that done wrong it is annoying, but done right and with a group that has a strong emotional response to music it can add a lot to the game.<br><br>I also use mood lighting and/or candle light in almost all of my games. I find that it helps take the edge off, especially if the room is at that level where you can easily read dice and character sheets, but everything else is just dim enough that it doesn't grab focus. Plus, I find that such lighting tends to draw the eye to the eyes of the other players, which is very helpful. <br><br>The only other prop, besides sound a light, that I use regularly is the character sheet itself. I tend to funktify my character sheets and add pictures, poems, whatever to make the sheet a point of focus that constantly refers me back to the character's themes and issues in a visual, emotional way (as well as the mechanical, rational way that the stats work). <br><br>Once in a while I've been able to run games in fully different settings, and the results have been mostly good. Playing Tribe 8 by firelight in the middle of the Canadian shield at night, or Polaris in High Park in Toronto as autumn is fading into winter added an ambiance not easily gotten in other ways. This is the only area where I've ever gotten close to anything like "dangerous use of props" -- running the post holocaust game in an abandoned neighborhood construction zone was probably not the wisest move I've ever made.<br><br>I've never been a big one for costumes, handouts, or other types of props. However, after reading Meg's comments I find myself intrigued.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
