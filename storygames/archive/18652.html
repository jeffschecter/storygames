I'm hoping you can do it again for my next one, scheduled for September. The goal is to pay for the design of a Google Hangouts App for playing S/Lay w/Me.<br/><br/>In advance: if you don't like or don't approve of the game itself, then I ask that you not threadjack. I'm looking for help from people who want to help.<br/><br/>Before I provide the link ...<br/><br/>It's not done, but the missing pieces should be obvious: no video, no link to the prototype app (which will be available during the Kickstart and is clearly a big deal), samples and images not yet ready. I'll be filling that stuff in pretty steadily.<br/><br/>Let me also explain the biggest issue: the reward structure is totally not normal. Every reward is $25, and they're not a hierarchy. You don't even have to choose which ones you want when you pledge, just pledge for X many, and at the end of the Kickstart period, your survey is mainly just a menu where you go click-click on the ones you want, however many for your pledge level (so you don't even have to remember). I'm looking forward to refining the language to explain this very much based on your comments here.<br/><br/>Only a few of the items are to be physically mailed, and the ones that are, the backer will be charged for shipping after the Kickstart, so there's no shipping payment prior to that point. (Has to be that way for about 50 reasons ...)<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!

I like pledge levels that tempt me upwards. For example, I'm paying $55 for two reward items, but if I pay just $15 more I get <i>three</i> items. It might be nice to add something extra for (say) 5 items and 10 items.<br/><br/>How does "You pay shipping" work? I would consider wrapping the shipping into the pledge levels (with additional fees for particular parts of the world). As it is, you might find yourself scrabbling around afterwards, emailing everyone to find which shipping package they'd like, waiting for people to reply, finding that some people never reply, dealing with bouncing emails, people giving different shipping addresses from the one in the Kickstarter...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419022/#Comment_419022" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T13:49:30+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  1:49PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Graham, I support folding shipping in if that's possible. You say that there's about 50 reasons why not, so at the very least, would providing a shipping estimate for common countries be reasonable? For a community that's used to "US: free shipping / everywhere else: pay extra", the big blank on how much shipping would cost will probably be a tiny bit weirding.<br/><br/>Given that this is for a Google Hangouts app for a two-person game, I'm wondering why the "play with X" rewards don't include the ability to just get a Google Hangout game together, when the app is done/in beta? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419033/#Comment_419033" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T15:53:29+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  3:53PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shipping is still a work in progress. It's worth pointing out that 2013 has been a vicious, evil year for shipping costs and all standards and habits dating from before this year are pretty much catastrophic for the supplier. I designed the Sorcerer Kickstart by those earlier standards. My shipping costs are turning out to be at least twice as high as expected in that design - due to increases in costs which were implemented <i>during </i>the Kickstart.<br/><br/>I think I'll include a link to a separate page which lays out my shipping plan for the reader, if they're interested. <br/><br/>At present (deep breath), the backer just has to get hit with whatever the calculations are from point A to point B, to be determined later and paid <i>after </i>the pledge period, and (deep breath again) if they don't like it and don't pony up, they can do without their reward and I keep the $25. As far as shipping methods go, it'll be handled one way and one way only. The standard survey includes inputting addresses, and unlike the Sorcerer Kickstart, rewards will be sent immediately so I won't have to deal with as many address changes.<br/><br/>Looking at that, you're right: it does seem brutal and wrong to keep the amount mysterious. The suggestion about estimates is a really good idea, say, to various urban centers around the U.S. and around the world, calculated from the point of shipping at such-and-such a date.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the only other real option is to bag the whole concept of shipping for the book entirely. The reward would be PDF including print format (as I did for Sorcerer), meaning that if you really wanted that book, you go to the local printer and walk out, or close enough, with one. Seriously, for non-U.S. sales, that would be significantly cheaper for the backer than paying for shipping. Crazy but true. However, I know truly well that "pledge and get a book in my mailbox" is lodged firmly in the heart of the RPG Kickstart backer community. I can't fight it, and I can't afford to be the guy who introduces the idea and pays the price, no matter how the community might change later. So I'm sticking with the physical book and seeking solutions - what you've said so far is already really helping.<br/><br/>Another thing I'm thinking of, as a sweetener, is to provide the current PDF as a basic reward for any and all backers. It's not the upgraded spiffy version (you pledge for that, PDF + book), but the rules are perfectly functional. That seems like a decent thing to do, it might prompt play (and Gallery submissions) during the Kickstart, and it might soften the "take it or leave it" quality of pledging for the book.<br/><br/>Thanks for the thoughts! The more the better, what you like, what seems puzzling, whatever. <br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419034/#Comment_419034" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T15:58:12+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  3:58PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ron,<br/><br/>I'm not sure if your audience is 'people who are already familiar with S/Lay w/Me' or not. If not, here's a couple of first impressions:<br/><br/>-- Assuming I read nothing else, I'd be unclear what the main title "S/Lay w/Me Play App Revolution" actually means. <br/><br/>Particularly, the word 'Revolution' - which I'm guessing in this context might mean 'revolutionary' (first of its kind), 'convenience' (it's making online play easier), or a jump in the type of quality of games we can have (evolutionary, rather than revolutionary).<br/><br/>The phrase "Play App" probably means an App that helps you play the game, but it could also be an online play app or (given how you're framing the kickstarter, a Google Hangouts app).<br/><br/>Maybe the solution is as simple as dropping 'Revolution' from the title. Maybe you could consider adding a verb: "Creating an app for online play of S/Lay w/Me"?<br/><br/><br/>-- There's no context for the tagline, "Advance the technology for playing the game"<br/><br/>I'd be tempted to be more specific here: "Advance the technology for playing S/Lay w/Me online" is one option. "Advance the technology for creating a community of players" is another. A more specific tagline would give the casual reader more of a reason to keep reading the page.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd be tempted to lead off with a one or two sentence summary of what S/Lay w/Me is (keeping the paragraph very very short), and then go to the bold tagline.<br/><br/>In fact, if I were to adjust the presentation, here's what I'd do:\n<blockquote>Hundreds of people have bought my game S/Lay w/Me ("slay with me") since its release in 2009. They've learned how well this fantasy RPG supports multiple adventures and brings the finest sword-and-sorcery spattering out from your own mind. <br/><br/><i>This isn't just fantasy role-playing - it's <b>what I want</b> from fantasy role-playing.</i> - Maura, one of the early playtesters<br/><br/>Let's get more of you together!<br/><br/><b>Advance the technology for creating an online community of S/Lay w/Me players</b><br/><br/>You probably already know about Google Hangouts...</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419035/#Comment_419035" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T16:01:40+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  4:01PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm helping out with another Kickstarter right now, Ron, and we're seriously considering the "print it yourself" option for folks outside the United States and maybe Canada. It seems totally bonkers, but unless you're talking about a microgame that can just use a Global Forever stamp (and especially if it's something that won't fit in a Global Priority envelope), the costs just don't make any sense. Folks in Europe and elsewhere would pay $40 shipping &amp; handling on a $20 game.  Honestly, my publication plans for my own creations are shifting towards full POD and microgames for exactly that reason, so I think you're doing the right thing there. Also, it'll be interesting to see if "here's a license to print it yourself" will actually work as a model going forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419037/#Comment_419037" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T16:23:46+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  4:23PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve: yes.

If my conversations with other publishers are representative, then yes, all of us are basically going to have to bag the well-established habits of fulfillment. Shipping is simply prohibitive no matter who's bearing the cost. I only wish that transition were over, because since it isn't, I have to either eat the pain of shipping books and shifting over the costs, or get rained on by enforcing an unfamiliar yet necessary policy. <br/><br/>For those who don't know, the "print it yourself" thing is now actually my policy in PDFs - you get both a screen-optimal one and a print-optimal one. I'm still selling the physical books too, but the customer bears the shipping cost. I'm hoping this leads people to calculate the shipping cost and find out the local printing cost themselves and therefore decide which way they'd prefer.<br/><br/>James, I realized I passed over your question about the "play with me" rewards. My current thinking is that they can either be in person or via the Hangouts app, and the geographic limitation is mainly in place for time-zone compatibility and to keep the volunteer from being swamped with a zillion pledges. I'm not sure if that answered your question, so if not, please let me know.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the minis modeling guy is now working on the Lover figure - I was pretty excited by his Monster, and I hope you are too. The music guy and I are having a blast, with four songs worked out on Midi and one completed for real. I just got word from the poster artist that the image I really want to use is available, too. So it's a good day for rewards development. Oh - and although only a couple of artists' work is currently visible at the gallery, I know that a few have contracted with people this week, so you can look forward to more going up.<br/><br/>If you've played the game, please consider submitting your information to me via the form at the gallery! <br/><br/>I'm open to suggestions for rewards that seem to you to fit with the approach I'm taking here.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419038/#Comment_419038" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T17:37:35+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  5:37PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, the Marshall Burns making the music is me.

If I give you some you will at some future date tell me how much more money I need to give you before I get my reward. If I decided that is new amount of money is more than I can afford, just keep the money I already gave you, and I get nothing.<br/><br/>I realize that there's risk involved if you include shipping, but just about every other company out there is willing to accept that risk. Why aren't you?<br/><br/>Another thing about the rewards, I might be missing something, but as far as I can tell, the product that your raising funds for is NOT a reward option. This seems extremely odd to me. When I back something on Kickstarter, its because I want the thing that I'm backing.<br/><br/>On last point that is probably the smallest for me, and wouldn't effect my purchase, but I'm not a huge fan of having all the reward levels be X reward items.

It'd be silly - to say the least - to run a Kickstart with the idea that a person, i.e. anyone, [i]should[/i] pledge by default. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of fixed issues from my point of view, so you can see where I'm coming from. I don't expect you to agree and I'm not trying to beat you down; it's merely a window into my head.<br/><br/>1. Shipping as it now stands is no longer a risk. It's bankruptcy. I just spent $11,000 out of the $26,000 I raised for the Sorcerer Kickstart on postage, shipping, and handling. As originally conceived back in December, $10,000 (the stated stretch goal) would have met that Kickstart's needs safely; given the changes in shipping rates by the end of January, it would obviously have been inadequate.* Getting 260% of that total didn't change that; what matters is the average pledge amount per person so I'm not just digging a hole and filling it in again. Jonathan is absolutely right, above - the whole commercial culture of RPGs is going to have to get revised regarding shipping, because the companies who stick with the older model will simply go under.<br/><br/>2. Crowdfunding is unnecessary for the physical goal of publishing a book. I can do that with funds and contacts at hand, if not "in my sleep," then damned close. In fact, anyone who claims to be running a Kickstart "to publish" a book is full of shit, because POD and other mechanisms are all here in place. What they are really doing is using the Kickstart culture as advertising and pre-order. I'm not [i]objecting[/i] to that strategy, but (i) let's call it what it is and acknowledge that it's not financially necessary for anyone simply to get their books produced, and (ii) that many RPG publishers have found it to be a very, very bad strategy when they look at their numbers in the end - and the more so now, with the shipping cost increases. So from my POV as publisher, when I try for some crowdfunding, it'll be for something special, which might be perceived by some at least as worth helping to bring to fruition.<br/><br/>3. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above has to be done realistically, which means admitting that people use Kickstart at least as much to shop as to donate in "angel" fashion. I am OK with this; hell, I do it myself! But it has led me to decide that separating [i]goal[/i], which is mine, from [i]reward[/i], which is yours is a very, very good thing for an RPG publisher.** I really can't get this app produced without the kind of money crowdfunding can provide, so yes, I "want your money." What I'm offering as rewards are absolutely nothing but a shelf of cool things to [i]buy[/i] with your pledges, and yes, therefore profit margin per purchase is a core concept for me, 'cause that's what funds my goal - I say so up-front and honest.  And please notice that one of them is what [i]other[/i] publishers would be offering as the goal anyway, i.e., the book (another reason I'm still holding onto the idea of keeping it physical) - so it's not like I'm bilking anyone out of that expectation. If you don't care about my goal, that's OK with me as long as you like your reward.<br/><br/>4. I strive at all costs for genuine quality in both the goal and the rewards. Blunt time: does anyone really think the RPG world needs a 7th edition of Call of Cthulhu? I certainly don't; my 3rd edition is worthy and wholly complete. Have you seen that recent book? I have; it's cheaply made, feels like nagahyde, the color of camel dung, thin and wispy paper, and just crappy overall. Did you know that the creators made each and every customer pay for 100% shipping above their pledge? If they can do that to peddle that unnecessary piece of shit, then I don't feel too bad for asking full shipping payment for (i) a good game (ii) in a genuinely attractive book (iii) in a reasonable/adequate size and hence cheaper to ship.<br/><br/>All that said, the replies to this thread have led me to a better way to explain the shipping which isn't so brutal, and also to let a backer know approximately how much they can expect to pay later if they choose one or more of the physical items. I haven't implemented those changes to the draft yet, but when I do, I think that people can least say, "OK, that's fair" and decide whether it's for them.<br/><br/>Thanks for your post. This is what I need from SG, the exposure of all the available views and the chance to rearrange either my thinking or the way I want to present it.<br/><br/>Best, Ron<br/><br/>* Transparency breakdown: $11000 as stated above, $2500 to Thomas for cover art and layout, $1000 or so to Nathan for interior layout and PDF mechanics, $5500 for printing the two books, and probably about $2000 for sundry costs like accountant's fee and stuff. Not a lot left for rubbing all over my body.<br/><br/>** I can see how making them the same is a fine thing for an inventor, or a filmmaker, for instance - there is a much wider audience the creator hopes to get to eventually. Whereas with RPGs, the people pledging are most of the same people who'd be buying it later anyway; hence my point about digging a hole and filling it in again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419104/#Comment_419104" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-27T09:11:56+00:00" title="July 27, 2013  9:11AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've made the changes!

It is likely that this option will actually be cheaper for overseas backers. <br/><br/>As an estimate so you can make an informed choice, here are the postage rates calculated on this date from the points of departure to major cities in the U.S. and some other nations.

The use of it ?<br/>Is there some kind of revenue model around this application ?<br/><br/>You should really stress out and list all the feature you will be providing. \n<blockquote>This Kickstart funds an add-on S/Lay w/Me application for it - a flawless platform for playing the game on-line, face-to-face, that will manage turn order, dice rolls, and similar things. It's not just a dice table; I'm shooting for a genuine working medium for playing a specific game. I want S/Lay w/Me to blaze a trail for the hobby into this technology.</blockquote>\nYou should be more explicit. How is it going to help me ? Why do I need it ?<br/>You'll telling me you're "shooting at a genuine working medium" : fine, but I think you'll need to say more.<br/>And by the way, have you thought of putting a "stretch" (what to do with more money) for your project ? With application it is very easy. And if you list (really a list) all the features of your application, you can find more and put them in the stretch.<br/><br/>If I don't play S/Lay w/Me can the application still interest me ? Are there features I can still use ?<br/><br/>Overall, I do find it odd that you seek money for a "revolutionary application", but you talk to me about a game, S/Lay w/Me ... You should get me excited about the application. Seriously, if you're on kickStarter you're addressing (or so I guess) more than you're current fan bases of S/Lay w/Me.<br/><br/>Otherwise, some suggestions :<br/>Some rewards that comes to my mind :<br/>- about alpha and beta access to the application (that's standard with that kind of product/service) ?<br/>- some art (if you have access to your illustrator) : let's say I describe you my character and you send me an image from the artist<br/>- your "play with X" reward : how come they are limited to region ? You're not going to use your application for the reward ?<br/>- have you though of some B2B (to other business, not customers) reward ? For instance, could you adapt your application for my system ?<br/>- can you use some kind of icons for the rewards ?<br/><br/>Personally, I don't like your reward structure ... I find it strange that each item is worth 25$. <br/>And what would do if you "oversell" "play with X" reward ? There should be some limits to those.<br/>Anyway, I'll think about your reward structure this weekend ...

Those suggestions and points will help me to make the whole thing more "digital first" and shift the physical option into a more coherent and easily-explained subsection.<br/><br/>Hi Sebastian, a lot of your questions fall best into the FAQ section, which the software won't let me post until it goes live. For example (and since it is indeed a "frequently asked question" at thisi stage), I'll explain why there is no formal stretch goal and what reasonable expectations of later development might be.<br/><br/>Your points and questions about the product itself - how do I get it, is it for sale, et cetera - are really important, as of now my top priority for the next phase of the draft. Thank you for that. (The answer is that I do not plan to sell the app or make it a revenue stream via use, but to provide it with the game. Effectively, the crowdfunders are making the thing available to the world.) Your business-to-business suggestion is also a good idea I hadn't come close to thinking of, so yes, I'll follow up on that. The icon suggestion is gold - that goes right into the blueprint for the finished page.<br/><br/>About explaining the app more completely, yes for sure. However, I'll rely less on paragraphs of claims and more on the video, and most especially the direct link to the working alpha. My thinking is that you can talk about an app all you want, but the best bet lies in showing it off, which the finished page will do. I think that will also appeal to people who are interested in apps and a bit less in the game. <br/><br/>The above point should answer your question about the alpha/beta access. Again, this is a working alpha, not a demo - so I'm effectively making the bare-bones but quite usable thing immediately and freely available. That's why it's not a pledge item.<br/><br/>I'll add your "if I don't play S/Lay w/Me" question to the FAQ. The app itself as such, probably not - but it does illustrate working principles for how apps can make real play possible on-line, so it's not just glorified chat with dice on the table next to you. Again, this is a claim on paper or the screen without anything to show you, so I'll develop the right phrasing when the page gets there.<br/><br/>My original list of rewards included artwork, but I went a completely different route by creating the gallery. I think it's a more constructive and long-term way to marry the game and illustration. Also, I am quite sensitive to the issue of people getting paid for their work and I decided that gamers getting artwork cannot possibly be a revenue stream for me. <br/><br/>On a related point, Marshall and the sculptor are getting a percentage of the pledges for those items; that's in the planned FAQ list too.<br/><br/>I'm still refining the "play with X" rewards. Given the reward structure I plan to use, there's no way to enforce limits during pledging. The regional limitation is a fingers-crossed means to cut down on the numbers of pledges per person, with the minor consideration of time zone as well. However, I don't like fingers-crossed methods, so as long as anyone's suggestion is consistent with my reward structure, I'm open to suggestions.<br/><br/>Thanks again!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419128/#Comment_419128" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T09:16:13+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  9:16AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, a couple of general comments ... and then, I'll give a try at your reward structure.<br/><br/><b>General comments :</b>\n<blockquote> I'll explain why there is no formal stretch goal and what reasonable expectations of later development might be.</blockquote>\nI'd be very interested in hearing that. You're giving up <i>a lot</i> of leverage for your campaign here.\n<blockquote>The answer is that I do not plan to sell the app or make it a revenue stream via use, but to provide it with the game. Effectively, the crowdfunders are making the thing available to the world.</blockquote>\nYou know this is a risky avenue ? Why I would then want to fund you ? I could sit back and wait for others to provide the funds for the application. Would there be a way to restrict access to the application to those who bought the game ? I also think that you need to state this upfront. Also, if you provide it with the game, then really do it (see later on your reward structure).\n<blockquote>About explaining the app more completely, yes for sure. However, I'll rely less on paragraphs of claims and more on the video, and most especially the direct link to the working alpha. My thinking is that you can talk about an app all you want, but the best bet lies in showing it off, which the finished page will do.</blockquote>\nI truly think you need them all : list of features, video, and working demo. Remember that the video and demo are "one click away" from the main page. About your working alpha : this might be tricky. As I see it, there are two avenues : presenting a working prototype (which are so damned ugly) OR present the final "functional wireframe" (using software like <a href="http://www.axure.com/" rel="nofollow">axure</a>) : it's beautiful, but it's not the "real thing".<br/>I believe, sometime, an ugly prototype just hinders the project ...\n<blockquote>My original list of rewards included artwork, but I went a completely different route by creating the gallery. I think it's a more constructive and long-term way to marry the game and illustration. Also, I am quite sensitive to the issue of people getting paid for their work and I decided that gamers getting artwork cannot possibly be a revenue stream for me. </blockquote>\nQuickly :<br/>- gallery and reward are not exclusive : just put the illustration from the reward into the gallery. As a fan I can take part at the "creation" of the world of the game.<br/>- don't put art reward at 25$ !!! It's worth much more than  that.<br/>- I'm not much talking about revenue stream, but more about giving interesting things to your fan base.<br/><br/>Ron, as you mentioned earlier, in this thread, KickStarter, at some points, is about "pre selling" ... but I think it is also about patronage. I don't think people are expecting to buy 1:1 on the price. On kickstarter, I think, prices are little bit higher, but you can get your hands on exclusive material and/or help create the product (access to alpha, create characters).<br/><br/>Last things :<br/>- your page should include a production schedule<br/>- maybe, just maybe, you need to emphasize on proving me you can deliver an app for this cost. I'm quite confident you can produce a game (in a book) and know about the cost/delay to produce it. I'm a little less confident about an app. Note : this is standard issue for all app kickStarter project.<br/><br/><b>Reward structure</b><br/>Ron, just keep an open mind : you won't be happy with my proposition !!!<br/>Things that bugs me :<br/>- your last reward level is all 12 items : in fact, this level is impossible. It would mean that I'll travel to Italy, Portland, Chicago ...<br/>- "Play with X" : I get it to play with you ... but who are the others guys ? You need to present them I think.<br/>- All item are not worth 25$. For instance, "Play with X", a 16-year old babysitter come to my house for 4 hours (I have two kids) and it costs me 50$. Especially if you say it is important for you that people get paid ... anyway, playing with a game designer (usually thru skype) are always at the bottom of the reward level, and there are not cheap.<br/>- Your reward level should show some kind of progression in the engagement of your backers. I don't see it here.<br/>- Your reward level should also reflect what <i>you</i> want people to pledge<br/>- all those problems with the shipping really, but really bugs me. I think you should "package" a single reward level with a lot of items being shipped, at a high price, so you don't care about shipping anymore ...<br/>- the figurines : why exactly ? What are they doing there ? Am I supposed to use them while playing ? Who do you think would buy them ? If you expect only fans to take those, than set it at fans' price.<br/>- instead of the poster, can you an artbook ? Something that I could use easily in my game ?<br/><br/>Quick notes :<br/>- the most common pledge is 25$<br/>- the average pledge is 70$<br/>- having a pledge at 1$, increase the amount of money you collect<br/><br/>My proposition - orientation :<br/>- the app is meant to be used with the game, so you're going to provide it, starting at 25$, and on all level, the pdf of the game<br/>- all digital rewards are the best for you : give them as much as you can<br/>- you're going to use the application as a reward with your game designers (no area restriction anymore). They should also be able to give a tour of the application. And this is worth 100$.<br/>- can you provide deluxe edition of the game in printed copy, like Luke did for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/burningwheel/torchbearer" rel="nofollow">torchbearer</a> ?<br/>- Can you have things like your poster or map of the world to give physical ?<br/><br/>My proposition - first draft :<br/>- you might set a 1$ pledge, like a "thank you" on twitter or Facebook<br/>- 25 $ is the basic set : you get the pdf and with the application, you're all set to play !!! (And Ron, this is what you want !!! People playing the game with the app)<br/>- 50$ or 70$ (around that) - hit with all digital : pdf, music, poster, your stories<br/>note : it's a shame I can't put some alpha or beta access to the application here ...<br/>After that, you might "branch" your reward (and remember to also give the digital stuff here) :<br/>- physical stuff : special copy of the book, signed by yourself, 2 figurines, a printed map, the poster ... name it, you have it ...<br/>.   - tag two levels : US only (let's say150$ or even more) and international (let's say 200$)<br/>- take part of building the world : art for instance, at around 150$<br/>- have a designer present you the game - Play with X : at around 150$<br/>.   - just need to check on how to add more<br/>Then, you mix them :<br/>- Physical + art : 300$ (350$, international)<br/>- Physical + game : 300$ (350$, international)<br/>- game + art : 300$ (350$, international)<br/>And all of them :<br/>- Physical + art + game : 800$/900$<br/>B2B :<br/>- get your system in the app : 2000$<br/><br/>Ron, I think you need to have more "control" on your reward structure. In fact, the reward structure should be used by you to encourage some behavior from your backers. Also, I believe my proposition helps you manage all the physical reward : one bundle at a high cost. They are going to be all the same for you to handle.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a first draft and it needs to be polished.

I'm concerned that some readers might take your comment referring to the paper quality of 'that recent book' to be about 7th edition; it clearly isn't since 7th ed won't be printed for some months. Which book are you referring to? Also, regarding shipping, the rates on the Kickstarter were $5 US, $10 Canada and $20 Rest of World (plus the odd dollar here and there for extras). Clearly you are well aware of the cost of shipping. Chaosium, the publishers, have stated that those amounts will only cover a part of the postage costs, not 100% by any means. <br/><br/>I too very much hope that the game that I have worked on will be (i) a good game (ii) in a genuinely attractive book.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419142/#Comment_419142" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T17:47:14+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  5:47PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul,<br/><br/>As a long-time customer of Chaosium books, I would be <b>so happy</b> to be wrong about this.

I offer the following as a mission statement about that.<br/><br/>I know this is different from how kickstarts are typically done, especially for RPG material. I'd really like help in making the new thing work, and I'm committed at this point to doing it this particular way. A lot of your suggestions are exactly what it'd look like if it were a chapter-and-verse, familiar kickstart, and that's not what I need.<br/><br/>1. I don't want the rewards to be nested or hierarchical in any way except for quantity.<br/>2. I also want them to be priced all the same. <br/><br/>What I'm looking for in this thread is help to find the best way to make these parameters happen.<br/><br/>Why? Well, because the rewards are not themselves hierarchies in the first place. One person might like the miniatures, another might not. One person might like to get the stories, another might not. So why should you be forced to get one of those if you want the other? Why not be able to get exactly the ones you want? Why should they be priced differently, when one person finds item X surprisingly and pleasingly cheap and item Y bewilderingly expensive, and another person has exactly the same reactions to the items except that for them it's Y and X?<br/><br/>Other kickstarts handle similar price structures through clunky add-ons and other jury-rigging; for example, my Sorcerer one ended up with a bunch of same-priced rewards that were difficult to track because Kickstart organizes things by price, e.g., the groupings of backers. This current idea is certainly different, but its point is definitely not completely alien, and I submit that how you pledge and what you get are in fact quite clear, and much more easily handled in this way.<br/><br/>Given those desires, certain things will be reconsidered. One is the idea of what certain rewards are intrinsically worth. If I want to "give away" playing a game with me for that small amount of money, then there's no price catalogue or law saying I can't. Another is the idea that limits and shipping can be listed/mandated the way they are in other kickstarts - they simply cannot, given the interface. So I have to set that up differently.<br/><br/>A person who doesn't want to look at a kickstart this way is fine by me. If you hate it, then you hate it. I don't like looking at certain kickstart models in the way their structure demands, so I don't pledge to those, therefore I can't complain about someone not <i>liking</i> this one. I'm sure you're aware that I've faced that particular issue before. However, I ask you to consider: is this about genuinely not liking what I'm doing, or about unfamiliarity? I also ask you to consider that there is absolutely no boilerplate, standard, accepted, and proven-best way to run an RPG kickstart. <br/><br/>Your other points about how to present app projects are a little difficult for me to agree with. One is that you seem to think I want a wad of money to <i>begin</i> seeking and developing the app. I've already paid the developer for the alpha, in progress as we speak. The kickstart pays him the rest of the way for the final version. I'm not sure - it's puzzling to me from your posts - whether you see that the alpha will be accessible to and usable by any Tom Dick or Harry who visits the Kickstart. Maybe I'm mis-reading you but it looks to me as if you think I'm <i>not</i> doing that. So, for clarity: yes, access, access, access.<br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419147/#Comment_419147" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T19:44:35+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  7:44PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn it!! -EN, not -AN. <i>Nothing </i>is going right today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419149/#Comment_419149" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T20:35:37+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  8:35PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is something new, and I appreciate your thoughts about innovation.

I need the game to play it online before the figurines, right ?

Seriously, for each item, you know exactly how much <i>margin</i> you do, and goes into the project. As for your 25$ "play with X", you've got good friends (lucky you, but then again, you need to present them) ... and they don't get paid. Because it's not worth that and they do you a favor.\n<blockquote>The kickstart pays him the rest of the way for the final version. I'm not sure - it's puzzling to me from your posts - whether you see that the alpha will be accessible to and usable by any Tom Dick or Harry who visits the Kickstart.</blockquote>\nI'm saying alpha access should be a reward. That's obviously not the case here ...<br/><br/><b>So, back to your challenge (respecting "our" three parameters) :</b><br/>As I mention, as I seek your "success" (unless you can pay the 6K$ right from your "pocket", in which case "success" is measured in a different way), you need to regroup items, if you want the same price, by "margin" ... margin that will help you get the app done. So, by this criteria, you'll get less items ... Even you, in your previous post, said "figurines", not figurine (if you're interested, you get both).<br/><br/>Now, my guess is that the number of "articles" would drop ... Anyway, your figurines, for instance, how many people do you expect will buy one but not the other ?<br/>And then, one <i>very important</i> question : what is your margin on "play with X" ?<br/><br/>And Ron, like it or not, I think that's exactly what I've proposed you before (just pick what you want) :<br/>150$ : play with X + pdf<br/>150$ : art + pdf<br/>150$ : physical + pdf<br/>Isn't what you ask for (by the way, that's also what I'm planning for my project) ? <br/>I just think 25$ (in part for the shipping) for each item is just too low.<br/><br/>Unless you want to add :<br/>4. each item must be worth 25$ [which would be hard]<br/><br/>Do I make any sense here ? Am I helping you (I'm really trying to) ? And think about delivering the product/service ...<br/>Ron, honestly, I do hate those "linear" reward in kickStarter - I'm also planning a "choice" for my customers : fully digital, fully physical, personalized content.

A few details are off, e.g., the figurines are not required or even useful to play; they're nothing but tchotchkes for one's desk or shelf. And the original PDF is going to be given for free to any backer, so you don't need to get the spiffy one in order to play at all. So there's less functional hierarchy to the rewards than you've perceived.<br/><br/>All "play with me" rewards are volunteers donating their time, me included. Is that a bad thing? (and bearing in mind that this whole "play with me" reward concept is going to be revised over the next weeks anyway as I dope out how to make it more practical)<br/><br/>We should talk about margins a bit more too. I budgeted for all the rewards beforehand and consider it an <i>Adept </i>expense, not a <i>Kickstart </i>expense. So I'm not really concerned about making that money back specifically from the Kickstart take! What I want from that take is the money for the app to be completed. I'd <i>like </i>to recoup the money spent on rewards of course, but that is intended to be a longer-term, annual issue which I hope to see from the later sales of my games, which I think is a reasonable expectation given my sales rate and may also be helped by the Kickstart in a secondary way, by boosting subsequent sales. So the money a given reward brings in is not itself intended to pay for that reward - it's all directed toward the goal, and excess becomes mad money, which could be app-oriented or not.<br/><br/>You've been asking tough questions, so I have one for you: is your series of posts here a matter of perceived self-defense? Are you worried that people will see your kickstart and say, "Hey, Ron only charged $25, what are you doing asking for so much more?" <br/><br/>I ask this fully acknowledging that your questions and objections have been really helpful and made me consider lots of the details much more carefully. I don't think you are working from an ulterior motive and I don't mind a single thing you've asked. My concern is, if that particular question is on your mind at all, that it may serve to distort the content of my posts (as you read them) and the content of yours (relative to my points), so the beneficial exchange we have here would be compromised. Better to get it out into the open, either for you to say, "Naw Ron, I'm good with that, charge as you will and so will I," or "Yes, that's a concern, and I think it is for you too if you under-value your rewards."<br/><br/>Best, Ron<br/><br/>P.S. If anyone's still confused about why I want to do these rewards this way, I realized there was another piece to it - that in Kickstarter as currently constructed, a backer has to pick one and only one of the listed rewards. So I can't simply offer them all, up and down, and say, "Pick which ones you want." I could, however, offer them all separately, and then say, "Hey, pledge for any one of them and add-on by increasing your pledge and tell me which ones you added on for," like I did for the $50 pledges in the Sorcerer kickstart - which is insanely aggravating to process in terms of order information.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419168/#Comment_419168" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T06:42:39+00:00" title="July 29, 2013  6:42AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A few details are off, e.g., the figurines are not required or even useful to play;</blockquote>\nI can't tell you why, but projects with figurines seem to have success on KickStarter.

Seriously.<br/><br/>That said, and a little bit off topic :<br/>I do understand better now your "cost structure" (expenses are from Adept, revenue is for the app), and it is very important for your campaign. But, it is a little bit cheating ... you could get 4K in reward expense and 6K for the app, why not just spend the 6K from your pocket directly (it would be 2K more for Adept, after all) ?<br/>More seriously Ron, I do have a general concern, and it is not specifically about your project. One of the main problem of KickStarter is delivering the project. What I'm saying is that calculating your margin by reward, building a reward structure that does not "ruin" your entire project is something people have to do. <br/>Now, maybe <i>you</i> don't, for various reasons, which might include that you could "lose" money (a little) from the kickStarter "adventure". But you're pretty damned lucky then. <br/>It might not be the case for everyone ... and some people might use your reward structure, saying "hey Ron did it and raised the money with no problem". And turned out losing money ...<br/>You see my point ?<br/><br/>Another thing about "value" : when Luke Crane (or you) proposes a game for around 14K/15K$, this makes sense <i>and</i>, honestly, feels professional. Pretending that a game can be developed for 250$ is simply not true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419176/#Comment_419176" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T07:59:01+00:00" title="July 29, 2013  7:59AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. I thought it would also be important to clarify that my app, the final version, is not really very app-like in terms of bells and whistles. It's driven by pure function, or Kalashnikov-tech as I like to call it. No animations, no chorus of trumpets, no mellifluous voice-over, no media crossovers ... it's going to be beautiful in a different way, especially in use. So its littleness, if you will, probably puts most app comparisons into apples/oranges territory.<br/><br/>Now for the financial talk. I really don't like your comment about cheating and I can't imagine how it applies. Your 4K/6K statement doesn't make any sense and leads me to think you're still not quite getting my whole financial picture - especially this business about going into a kickstart with a negative-outcome model. What on earth makes you think I'd want to do that? I've built my whole RPG publishing history on the point that you can be small and independent without being a vanity press!<br/><br/>Contrary to your concern, I want people to sit up and take note of what I'm doing with this, and if it works out, to learn from it. So many kickstarts, especially RPG ones, rob their goal money to pay for the rewards they're promising in order to get the goal money, which is clearly self-destructive, is actually made worse by higher gross gains, and has led to several rather appalling and depressing situations already. I'm hoping to try out a better way.<br/><br/>Therefore, this project is built on the ideas of asking help to raise the money you need, not spending money you don't have, and investing money you do have (i) that you can afford to lose but (ii) more likely will yield multiple long-term gains. My reward expenses are completely under control and tuned to keep me from disaster even if the kickstart fails. There's no net loss here, merely affordable expense. The only money I need that I can't provide as a single lump is for the app, so that's the money I'm stating as the goal. All of this is a good thing, not a bad one or a cheat.<br/><br/>You're making a lot of assumptions and correcting them one by one is wearing me out. Maybe we're better off if I simply ask you to stop acting as tough-minded financial consultant based on guesses and to start looking at the draft as a friendly fellow gamer. That's why I've posted it here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419179/#Comment_419179" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T08:58:14+00:00" title="July 29, 2013  8:58AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay Ron sorry.

(Ron, correct me if I'm wrong on any of these points)<br/><br/>Ron's financial goal is to _pay the developer the developer's cost to make the app_<br/><br/>All the rewards are things that Ron can pay for _regardless of the campaign's success_, but he does not have the cash-on-hand to simply pay the developer for the app, plus, running a Kickstarter is (lets not be shy now) a marketing move as much as it is a financial move.<br/><br/>So, other than making sure he doesn't lose his shirt on shipping, Ron already knows his fixed costs for the rewards, and knows he can cover them. I'm imagining that overage on meeting the goal could go towards making sure he can cover _all_ the rewards. <br/><br/>The conceptual ground is this: his goal is to make the app freely available, in the world, to anyone who wants to use it. That's why it's not a backer-specific reward - it's not supposed to be limited to the backers in the first place!<br/><br/>The rewards are ephemera associated with the game. The book is, yes, necessary to play, and this is a good way to get it if you don't already have it - but you can, and will be able to, get the game text outside of the campaign structure. The other stuff _could be_ T-shirts, stickers, framed prints, signed pictures of Ron's smiling face, or whatever. In this case, they're stuff surrounding the idea of the game that Ron thinks is cool, that's pretty much it!<br/><br/>He's decoupling the _rewards_ from the _goal_ of the project, much in the way that a dance or music project (generally) does. It's weird for RPGs, but it's not so weird for the other arts.<br/>...<br/><br/>Anyway, that said, I do think offering meatspace play is kinda weird since the goal of the thing is an app to enable online play. So, that's point one.<br/><br/>Point two, what if you treat it as an "add-on" instead of a reward level, cap it at whatever level you're comfortable with (say, 25, for the sake of argument) and when you've gotten that 25th person who added 25$ to their pledge and messaged you to say "I want to play!", you put a big notice at the top of the page "no longer accepting the play-with-me addon"?<br/><br/>Point three, having the $1 "pledge to support the project" level never hurts, and will enable people who want to help out the project but don't necessarily want any of the rewards to do so (I mean, technically you can always pledge a lower amount, but UI wise having the reward level sitting there with the others means people will actually DO it).<br/><br/>Hope some of that is helpful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419206/#Comment_419206" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T16:09:33+00:00" title="July 29, 2013  4:09PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sebastien, <blockquote>when in fact he was saying <i>"My math doesn't add up, but I know it, and I don't care [because of X, Y and Z]"</i></blockquote>\nAlmost. My math adds up a lot better than you might think.

"My goal is mine, your rewards are yours," and typically one of the rewards will be the game in question.<br/><br/>In other news, the Kickstart people have helped me re-phrase the reward tiers so that we're all happy, and I've implemented a lot of the suggestions I've received here. I am now definitely re-tooling the play-with-me rewards, although the perfect solution for a simple one-line reward description has not yet suggested itself. I'm trying to avoid add-ons and other stuff; the shipping option is enough complication as it stands.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419217/#Comment_419217" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T23:30:23+00:00" title="July 29, 2013 11:30PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm liking the new no 'play-with-me' reward structure.<br/><br/>I wonder if you should spell out what 'digital' means in relation to the miniatures a bit more. It's clear for everything else, but for the miniatures you could say 'digital files to print your own 3D copy' or 'digital: .ply / .wrl / .vrml file'.<br/><br/>One more thing. I'm going to suggest this even though I've taken in your point that you're happy with the costs of the rewards you're offering. I wonder if you're under-valuing your playtest feedback. Specifically, I'm wondering if it's so cheap that a magnitude more people than you expect will take you up on it ... leading to you have less time to do your own stuff than you'd want.<br/><br/>If so, here's one solution: have you considered making the 'playtest feedback' reward cost two or three slots? Like, to get it, someone would have to pledge at the $50 or $75 level at least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419294/#Comment_419294" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T07:50:45+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  7:50AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK! Given some head-scratching, I've removed the problematic rewards (finally realizing that "play with me" is a silly reward when you're offering free play-with-me-or-anyone as the goal), solved the shipping problem in a slightly clunky but the only viable way,* clarified the public-access nature of the goal, laid in spots to add more information when it's ready, joined Google + (!!), and put in the preliminary poster art for the opening image so Kickstart won't relegate me to its porn ghetto. Many thanks to everyone who's posted - every single one of you made a big difference and you can probably see your influence directly at the page.<br/><br/>Here's that <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847190685/1797406953?token=d2fc3585" rel="nofollow">preview link</a> again. You'll notice that I want to add more rewards, and that's what I'm asking about now. What do you think would make good additions? I'm happy to provide creative work that you suggest within pretty broad limits. Please consider the following parameters ...<br/><br/>1. Digital, on-line, or activity-based are vastly preferred, no more shipping please.<br/><br/>2. Limiting the reward's availability only to the kickstart, or the way it's being done only to the kickstart, is vastly preferred.<br/><br/>3. Volunteerism is great and I'm all for it (I did regret eliminating the kind people who'd offered to be "play-withers"), but remember that I can't limit the number of backers for you, so see if you can dream up a way to structure it so it works for you.<br/><br/>3'. For volunteers, I do have limited but real funds to help finance some product or action you'd be willing to contribute; get in touch with me privately about the details if you have an idea.<br/><br/>More than two additional rewards would be fine; I can always add more tiers.<br/><br/>Best, Ron<br/><br/>* Rationale: I don't want funds which are slated to disappear to be part of the funds officially collected. What I mean is, let's say I make exactly $6,000 right at the end of the Kickstart period, no more and no less, and lets say the average pledge was $50, so 120 people total. But if half of all those people had upgraded their pledges by an average of $25 each for shipping, then $1500 of that $6000 is not going toward my goal, even though Kickstarter counts it as such.<br/><br/>See what I mean? If I make $6000, then I want to use it as God &amp; me intended. Letting upgraded pledges add to that amount puts me in the position of making my goal on paper ("legally" if you like) but not literally.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419298/#Comment_419298" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T08:47:02+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  8:47AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron, your kickStarter page it is better this way.

If anyone wants to volunteer a reward, i.e., provide something themselves, then it's up to them to decide how much money they want to put into it, i.e., sink, if any. For certain things I'd consider repeating the deal I have with Marshall and Tyler: sharing a cut from the pledges for that item.<br/><br/>I hope it's clear that I'm not specifically soliciting volunteer work, but instead, that the default suggestion I'm soliciting is something that I, me, Ron, would be doing or providing. The volunteer thing is merely there if anyone's burning with the urge, and I don't want it to become some huge controversial topic as if it were the central point.<br/><br/>I love the figurines too, but they do cost money to sculpt, the very sort of investment you were warning me to avoid. I'll stick with the two I've got - nicely tuned to the cover art - and reserve the idea for future rewards.<br/><br/>The thing with the artwork is that I've set the Adept policy so that I don't buy it outright, and its ownership, specifically commercial ownership, remains with the artist. Therefore I don't monetize art twice, using it only for promotion and publication as leased. So if a given artist, or more than one, wanted to make such a book or anything like it (t-shirts, et cetera), then they should be the ones benefiting from it financially. I suppose such a thing might fall under the category of volunteerism in this case of a limited-edition kickstart reward, perhaps high-quality prints, donated if you will.<br/><br/>Good suggestions - don't get the idea that I'm being the no-man for its own sake.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo" title="Maese_Mateo"><img alt="Maese_Mateo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/nVSZHDY85YP2W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo">Maese_Mateo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419324/#Comment_419324" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T15:45:16+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  3:45PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, the page looks a lot better now.<br/><br/>I was wondering: is there any reason why there isn't a tier to get the new PDF alone, without the old PDF or the App?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419330/#Comment_419330" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T17:27:10+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  5:27PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2013 5:28PM by Ron Edwards.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That question seems backwards to me. Maybe I should explain a little bit more about the background and the procedures.<br/><br/>First, Kickstarter required me to put the phrase "gets the app" into each tier, and I can see why: they need each tier to include something concrete and not merely point to the rewards list. This is the case even though, if the goal is successful, the whole world gets the app. So (i) removing the app from the tiers would mean Kickstarter wouldn't let me do this project, therefore the phrase has to stay; and (ii) there is literally no way <i>not</i> to get the app, in the sense of having it available to you. You can, of course, choose to ignore its availability.<br/><br/>Second, providing the old PDF for free is a really nice thing to do, and also fair. It means a person doesn't <i>have</i> to pledge for the new one in order to enjoy the app, and I think it would pretty much suck if I asked people to back a goal for an app and then demanded a specific pledge in order for them to be able to use it. And if you don't want to get it, then don't bother to download it from the Bookshelf, and you never will.<br/><br/>If a person really doesn't care a hoot for anything but the new PDF and for some reason is bothered by "receiving" two things that they never have to get anyway, then they can wait until the Kickstart is over, when it becomes available for public purchase, and they can get it then. <br/><br/>Best, Ron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo" title="Maese_Mateo"><img alt="Maese_Mateo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/897/nVSZHDY85YP2W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maese_Mateo">Maese_Mateo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419332/#Comment_419332" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T17:41:47+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  5:41PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense.
