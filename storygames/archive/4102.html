In response he offered <a href="http://eyebeams.livejournal.com/318834.html" rel="nofollow">The Deal</a> - he'd playtest your game and provide a redline of your current text with feedback in exchange for a credit in the final version, a copy of the final version (in whatever form you want), and $20. I took Malcolm up on his offer and sent <i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> off to him. Here's what happened.<br/><br/><b>The Playtest</b> <br/>Because I was working on a schedule to finalize the game for Gen Con, I asked Malcolm if The Deal could be delivered in a month. He affirmed it could. A couple of weeks later, I received a playtest report of a single session playtest he facilitated with two other players. Malcolm and company identified some areas where the rules were unclear and reaffirmed a prior playtest's comment that a worksheet for brainstorming would enhance play. However, the group decided not to use beverages during play or time their narration - both essential elements of the rules and the key methods of pacing play. As a result, several comments on rules interactions were off-base because the concerns would not occur if the timer was being used.<br/><br/>So while I got several pieces of useful feedback that did result in changes to the game, other aspects of play were entirely unexplored. I was a bit disappointed because I was very interested in seeing how the non-traditional mechanics would be received by folks outside the SG/Forge fold. <br/><br/><b>The Redline</b><br/>A couple of weeks later I received Malcolm's redline of my current text. I was blown away by the amount of effort he put into going through the text and offering feedback on everything from organization to word choice to rules suggestions to ways to pitch the game more strongly. Malcolm's experience as an RPG writer definitely showed through, and his comments resulted in major changes to the text that improved clarity and streamlined the organization and presentation of topics. The redline was invaluable.<br/><br/><b>The Takeaway</b><br/>Malcolm has since apologized for the haphazardness of the playtest, but it was still useful. The redline was itself worth the price of admission. I'll definitely take Malcolm up on his offer again when my next game is more baked, and I would recommend that other designers look into The Deal. <br/><br/>So that's my story. Any questions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91748/#Comment_91748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:22:06+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91750/#Comment_91750" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:25:05+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the good way or the bad way, Jake?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91752/#Comment_91752" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:26:05+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome. $20 is a steal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91771/#Comment_91771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T11:45:11+00:00" title="August 30, 2007 11:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like an excellent bargain.

Part of the reason was that I just didn't have any interesting drinks on hand. Part of the reason was that mt brain was filled with a major IP development contract that had me on a bus for huge chunks of the week. Nevertheless I did want to apply a "field test," ethos, where I tried to just take the path of least resistance when it came to keeping the game fun.  And we had fun -- so success!<br/><br/>Why am I doing this? I <a href="http://eyebeams.livejournal.com/318834.html" rel="nofollow">covered that here</a>:<br/><br/>. . . but I'm willing to elaborate here. This may be controversial, though.<br/><br/>The key event that made me turn my back on the Forge for good was when I wanted to talk about Dominion, a game I was going to do way back in'04. I believe very, very strongly in the importance of strong, focused critical feedback and had originally planned to hand Nick Mamatas editing and development duties as part of an arrangement where it would be published through a division of Nightshade books. It was an ideal arrangement and one I believed would create a bridge between creator ownership and mainstream design and development. For one thing, I was struck about how little many critics actually *knew* about that process.<br/><br/>In retrospect, the reaction I got was predictable but I'm not going to cover it in detail. Suffice to say that it confirmed to me that the Forge's definition of "indie" does not, to me, support any kind of creative integrity. It's just a commercial pretense and as I directly witnessed, excludes creator-owners who don't conform to its commercial doctrine.<br/><br/>Fast forward to late April, when I became aware of some serious dissent in the indie community. There were designers within the community who felt exploited and people making highly controversial statements about what their colleagues' games were worth. Again, I don't think it would be constructive to go into detail, but I felt that the lack of a critical/quality control process could have headed of these problems. Furthermore, I was still interested in demonstrating what the development process was like because there's a serious gulf between reality and perception in the indie community.<br/><br/>So from there I offered the Deal, for the following reasons:<br/><br/>* It would demonstrate the value of the development process.<br/>* It would demonstrate that this process had *financial* value with a mostly-symbolic fee.<br/>* It would show how the process doesn't compromise the creator's interests and leaves plenty of room for creator . . . creativity. (The need for this recently asserted itself in Gareth's big thread, where yet again it was implied that freelancers are mere instruments of the creator-owner.)<br/>* It promotes Mob United Media.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that The Deal is a quick, dirty, partial version of the work I did on Stew's <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1137037" rel="nofollow">Aeternal Legends.</a> (BUY IT.) I provided detailed stylistic and thematic critique, not to impose my own vision, but to draw out interesting bits that he gave superficial coverage to. For instance, the game assumes that people in the secret world have their own modern-style governments and bureaucracies so that you can run games based on high fantasy electioneering. I asked that this be expanded significantly since it had so many neat implications.<br/><br/>As I said, the 20 bucks is symbolic and I get value from advertising. I may alter the Deal (pray I don't alter it further . . .) by asking for ad space, but for now, it does what I want it to do. I still strongly believe that thee are some problems with the way the community treats people who aren't "designated auteurs" and the way it expects talent to value themselves. My position on that <a href="http://mobunited.livejournal.com/10131.html" rel="nofollow">is explained here</a>.<br/><br/>I haven't done anything more with the Deal because Eric was the only person to submit a full-fledged draft (thouh I number of people expressed initial interest). That's changed in one case, though, and I have another game queued up.

With Stew and Eric, I based commentary on investigating what they wanted to accomplish and providing specific advice -- often sentence by sentence -- on how to do it. I tried to draw out things that were only implicit in the draft because in many cases, the author has all kinds of ideas that he hasn't completely explained in the desire to keep the content flowing. This is different from maintaining consistency across a line -- though contrary to what you might think, this is often more a matter of consolidating input than demanding specific content. (It depends on the line/company/developer -- Shadowrun's development process features a bit more adherence to predefined vision than Mage's, where you throw cool ideas out under the loose outline and the developer integrates them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91916/#Comment_91916" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:45:49+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>I think that the emphasis on indie as a publishing model and is tainting the entire discourse.

Don't conflate the Deal with my opinions about the overall ethics and broad creative discipline behind small-scale, for-profit publishing. On the other hand, it *is* work and deserves compensation, which is why I ask for it. If you were to ask someone else to do the same thing for 20 bucks, I wouldn't say that was a good thing to do because as straight cash it's really underpaying the person. In my case it conflates promotion with my own artistic and ethical agenda.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
