It was about some kids who were in a School for Spies, and here's my point about it:<br/>\n<br/>\nGame #1:  We had big, big, big dreams.  Raven wanted her (storied) grandfather to think she was a worthy successor to his legacy.  She planned to pull a big, complicated double-cross on some of her classmates to make it happen.  She feared that if he found out that she needed his approval, he'd stop loving her as a grand-daughter.  Dustin wanted Raven to see him as more than just the muscle-head of their group.  He planned to run an operation behind her back to make that happen.  If she found out too soon, she might never trust him again.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame #2:  We had one small dream:  Raven wanted (adversary) Tom Hawke to be interested in her.  She planned to pull a desperate operation <i>without</i> resorting to dirty tricks, so that he could see that her (increasingly decent) tactics could work.  She feared that if he found out that she wanted his attention, he'd cease to have any lingering respect for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> was good, but felt very driven and frantic.  Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> was <b>awesome</b>, and felt natural and comfortable in pacing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, we sometimes froze up ... unable to figure out how to address something BIG ENOUGH, we addressed very little of any consequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, we always had more ideas than we knew what to do with, and skipped from one to the other according to which was the most important <i>right now</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the conclusion of Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> we addressed the big, big dreams, and it was heart-warming but felt very inexorable and final.  It was unclear what either of the characters could do <i>next</i>, having resolved the one thing driving them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the conclusion of Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, Raven confessed that she secretly "likes" Tom (and, yes, it was that ambiguous) ... which was a <b>total</b> surprise, but felt completely natural, and leaves us desperately wanting to know what comes next.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would suggest (with actual play to back it up) that there is great fun to be had by aiming for much <i>less</i> than the most intense thing you can do just this moment.  I would go on to suggest that there are a wide panoply of techniques (like, for instance, framing scenes that have no point except to show the characters being themselves) that are well suited for this goal and poorly suited for the goal of seeking out high intensity ... and that those techniques have been given short shrift by our design community, precisely because of the focus on high-intensity play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171439/#Comment_171439" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T07:52:01+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  7:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 7:52AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group does not like high-intensity play because, well, we have high-intensity jobs and the last thing we want at the end of the week is more.

Shooting for high-intensity gets you something that is very intense and frantic.  But, when that rush wears off, it's gone.  Calming down, chilling out, slowing down a bit, and letting the characters <i>be</i> characters (framing scenes for characters to just be themselves is a wonderful thing), that leads to something that is calmer, but more nuanced and <i>resonant</i>.  Intensely resonant, sometimes.<br><br>What I'm saying is that the <i>real</i> intensity is when you don't Shoot For Intensity.  Shoot For Intensity gets you a nice, sweet rush, but it's empty calories.  It's a candy bar.  The slower, calmer kind is a steak.  (I also think that the slower, calmer kind is the one that's referred to on the cover of <i>Sorcerer</i>)<br><br>I figured this out the hard way with <i>The Rustbelt</i>.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171529/#Comment_171529" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T13:07:18+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  1:07PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 1:07PM by TonyLB.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall:  I've had way too many really wonderful high-intensity games to think that it isn't satisfying.

I was inspired to write it because of a game I played a few years ago and still look back at fondly.<br><br>I had four players: a disgruntled roleplayer (he had stopped having fun with RPGs; but he stilled had some hope, evidently, as he joined this game), a long-time-ago-I-think-I-kind-of-remember roleplayer, and two total newbies.<br><br>This meant that I wasn't keen to lean on any heavy stuff. I wanted to let things develope naturally. We also weren't using any sort of system that would drive behaviour in any given direction--it was a light, stay-out-of-the-way kind of system.<br><br>Also, everyone (including myself) was learning as they went along. Two people were totally new; the others (including me) were trying to play in a style completely different from anything we'd tried before, without any clear guidance or goals--we were all just aware that we wanted something _different_. Having to clarify the procedures of play slowly and carefully meant that the game itself proceeded at a very leisurely pace.<br><br>And the result was really, really wonderful. A heart-warming, moving story everyone enjoyed, which mostly consisted of people talking to each other and some occasional light conflict (some arguments, a minor theft, a friendly sparring match which became important because onlookers showed up and one of the parties involved wanted to impress them). Unfortunately, the game had to end just as we were hitting our groove (three sessions in)... and what was interesting is that, just then, I felt like we were ready to go somewhere, and at the point I started really wishing we were using a system that would give us all a kick in the butt and some more hardcore conflicts and issues. I'm not sure the game, as it had started, could have continued indefinitely and still been fun.<br><br>One of the keys was that no one (including me as the GM) was pushing much, fiction-wise or pacing-wise. Also, whether by coincidence or not, the two new players created characters that had similar issues to their own, and that made them more sympathetic and/or funny--we all wanted to cheer when they went to overcome their issues.<br><br>Roleplaying, as an activity, can have this wonderful feeling of "exploration", whether it's the fiction being explored or just the process itself. I could see the players thinking, "OK, but what if I do this... what will happen? Ok, gently..." I personally have played many wonderful games which consisted largely just of exploring a fictional milieu and enjoying discovering things about it. Kind of similar to the computer game <i>Myst</i>.<br><br>I don't know if that helps.<br><br>But I've also been rereading Eero's "Solar System". And that has "refreshment scenes" in it. That seems to belong in this conversation, somewhere. I dunno.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171554/#Comment_171554" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T14:12:20+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  2:12PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, can you tell me what you mean when you say "high-intensity" roleplaying?

I guess you mean emotional intensity, but you could easily have just meant pace. I have not played any of the "Indie" games. I can see that there is an earnest intent there to produce some novel and profound role-playing experiences. I can make two guesses as to what this is about..<br>\n<br>\nIs there a pressure to perform developing among some gaming groups? I have had good and bad experiences with getting into character, but I have never felt that I had anything to prove, so I only ever dissappointed myself. Are people getting more self conscious about this?<br>\n<br>\nDoes everyone get the basic point about working from the outside in? If you pick some external traits, this helps you make the character 'live' in the first instant. Then you can 'realise' more facts about them in play. Certainly picking on a major moral dilemma before the character has a chance to breathe a natural breath sounds like hard work.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171651/#Comment_171651" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-27T04:18:16+00:00" title="September 27, 2008  4:18AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Tony,<br/><br/>My question was not intended to hijack the thread into a dissection, only to check that I shared your understanding of what you were talking about before I responded.

A movie that was a 100% action scenes would be very intense, but it wouldn't feel natural or comfortable.  The second installment of the Matrix suffered somewhat in that regard.<br/><br/>This is a topic I'm really curious about, because I've had the problem being described here, and I've also had the opposite problem, with no intensity and a lot of slow scenes that don't seem to add much to the game.

You've given structure to some wispy thoughts flying around in my head. I'm going to have to chew on this for a little while, but I think this is the kind of thing I need to encourage more of in my regular BW game. When we do have those quite, more subtle scenes, they're often my favorites. And they often do a lot to inform the rest of the story and build depth to the characters. Hmm...I wonder...So on occasion, I get a little frustrated with my players because they "bring the awesome" but it's done in such a way that makes the characters a little less believable (and therefore, the story as well) - you know, their actions seem random or basically good characters do awful things without blinking. I think this may be a sign that they are lacking blocks to build on in the story. They aren't getting enough scenes to build layers and even morality into their characters, and while their characters deal with the outer consequences of their actions, they don't always have to deal with the inner or more personal consequences, which can do a LOT to enrich a story.<br/><br/>Thanks for this thread...this will be tumbling around in my thoughts for a while.<br/><br/>-Rachel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171739/#Comment_171739" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-28T07:39:29+00:00" title="September 28, 2008  7:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony -- Yeah, that does make sense.
