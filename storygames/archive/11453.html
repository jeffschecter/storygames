I've been phrasing this thing slightly differently from anybody else for years - I think that this is a more useful way of looking at this, but it hasn't caught on to any great extent for some reason. As far as I'm concerned this is just standard Forge theory phrased in an easier form.<br/><br/><b>Conflict resolution</b><br/><br/>"Conflict" is not a term of natural language - it's a technical term introduced at the Forge (for our purposes, I mean) to distinguish a specific literary phenomenon: conflict happens when dramatic actors (characters in a story who represent some sort of value or meaning) have a disagreement with each other or with the environment, and move to resolve it. "Conflict resolution" concerns this phenomenon.and how it is handled in roleplaying. Conflicts are resolved and therefore "conflict resolution" happens whenever dramatic actors move to resolve their disharmony. This happens on all games and even literary works that have dramatic actors and resolutions of conflicts, it's not in any way special or uncommon.<br/><br/>The important technical breakthrough of the early Forge-style games like <i>Sorcerer</i> (pretty much the definition of "Forge-style" as a matter of influence) was the idea that you could detach a conflict from the narrative and consider it as a discrete phenomenon to be mechanized or otherwise handled by the game. This approach to conflict resolution is often cited as the meaning of the term, but I find that this confuses people more than helps them. It is absolutely well-established that a rules-set like the D&amp;D combat system in fact does resolve conflicts (insofar as the player characters have been developed into dramatic actors), for example. Discussing conflict resolution like it was some new thing that didn't exist in games before this decade is a surefire way to get people to look at the superficial structures instead of what is actually happening. Are conflicts being resolved? If they are, you have conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Now, when we say that a game "doesn't use conflict resolution", what we mean (or should usually mean) is that the game either doesn't concern itself with resolving conflicts, or it does require conflict resolution, but its rules fail to do so, and thus any resolutions are left up to the group in the form of GM fiat, unwritten group methodology or other means. For example, we might say that D&amp;D doesn't have social conflict resolution, but we wouldn't actually mean that social conflicts do not get resolved in D&amp;D; we just mean that when social conflicts do get resolved, it does not happen out in the open, according to explicit procedures, but in a murky mix of GM fiat, advanced applications of the task resolution system and freeform roleplaying.<br/><br/><b>Task resolution</b><br/><br/>Task resolution as a theory term originates as an opposition for conflict resolution, but here I find that I can't reconcile the practically useful term with the theoretical idea that task resolution is somehow opposed to conflict resolution, as an alternative. Rather, let me float a definition that I feel people actually go by in practice even in theoretical circles:<br/><br/><b>Task resolution is the resolution of tasks in the fiction; when characters undertake actions and those actions have outcomes, "tasks" are being resolved.</b><br/><br/>Just like conflict resolution, task resolution is rather common and nothing out of the ordinary in games. Any game that involves characters undertaking actions, if it should resolve those actions in some manner, involves task resolution. Just like conflict resolution, again, the term is non-committal about the means of resolution: we might say that a game "does not have" task resolution when tasks are resolved in a freeform manner - this is not strictly exact, but it's good enough when we're talking of mere mechanics and not practical play.<br/><br/>The problem with having a well-defined task resolution system but having the conflict resolution system dysfunction (usually because the game's rules text doesn't address conflict resolution, and thus a bad GM gets to mess with it) is that task resolution alone is in reality pretty boring. It does have value in certain types of games for color and immersive purposes, but if you're really looking to resolve conflicts in your game (a necessary precondition to any story games, narrativist or simulationist, for example), then task resolution detached from conflict resolution is just rolling dice without meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255120/#Comment_255120" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T20:04:56+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  8:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>Looking at task and conflict resolution from the above viewpoint (which to my understanding is amply compatible with the Big Model, and should be for the most part really obvious to anybody), it should be evident that they are not things in the same frame of reference at all! Those interminable discussions about task vs. conflict resolution are completely meaningless, as these two things are separate and independent of each other. HIstorically a lot of hot air has been blown about task vs. conflict resolution, but to my eyes that's about as intelligent a topic as dice versus chairs - you can have both in your session, and aside from some very experimental games, almost always do.<br/><br/>A game that has <b>explicit conflict resolution</b> via <b>explicit task resolution</b> is a game where dramatic actors have disagreements and move to resolve them (conflict resolution), and this is done by choosing a task or several, which are then resolved (task resolution), and this resolution is in turn fed into the conflict resolution process for a final outcome. This sort of thing is so mind-bogglingly common that people are in fact usually blind to it: D&amp;D (in combat), Sorcerer, DiV and a host of other games all work exactly like this. Most specifically, <i>Solar System</i>, which I've been working with lately, very much works like this: when a conflict is first recognized, the players continue to describe the action until it is sufficiently clear what tasks are aesthetically pleasing as crucial turning points in the conflict; then those tasks are resolved, and the rules say that whoever won the task resolution also wins the conflict. This is the reason for why you can win a conflict in SS with a sword-fighting ability: the rules say that conflict resolution is flexibly nailed into specific tasks on the moment of resolution, so if the players explicitly agree that this conflict will be resolved with a swordfighting task, then that's how it is going to be, and any further complications in the fiction will be resolved in favour of whoever won that swordfight. In SS and many other modern conflict resolution games the conflict-task correspondence is pretty arbitrary in that the players can choose whatever abilities they find sensible for resolving whatever conflicts that come up in the game - the only requirement is that the fiction is described in a way that makes a sort of sense narratively. This is all natural to us as humans, as we see this all the time in fiction: much fiction works on the premise that the writer carefully arranges complex conflicts and describes them in such a way that the outcome ultimately hinges on just some simple action sequences which, when successfully resolved, lead into a happy ending.<br/><br/>A game that does not have explicit conflict resolution but does have <b>explicit task resolution</b> is the sort that people usually complain against when they advocate explicit conflict resolution. In this type of game the rules say that whenever the characters try to do something, you roll dice and find out whether they succeed. However, because the rules do not actually have anything firm about when and why these task resolution procedures should be engaged, and also doesn't have any rules on conflicts, this practically means that the GM will naturally use the task resolution rules as a guideline in resolving conflicts as well. This can work well if the GM instinctively or by experience uses the task resolution system to resolve conflicts logically, fairly, quickly - just like a game that has explicit parity between the two resolution types. However, if the GM should not be up to the task, we get the sort of horror stories that have given task resolution a bad reputation: meaningless task resolutions, illusionary meaning in the task resolutions, lacking a task to resolve a given conflict (really common in scale-based situations like when we'd like to roll the dice just once to resolve a month's worth of activities) and so on.<br/><br/>A game that does have <b>explicit conflict resolution</b> but doesn't have explicit task resolution is also well-known: games like my own <i>Zombie Cinema</i> and other "hippy" games often are like this. Even if the game doesn't have skill lists and never asks you to roll the dice about a given, discrete task, it is likely that tasks are still being resolved. It's just that the game's rules allow most of the tasks to be resolved by declaration: the player just says that his character (or some other character, in fact) does this and that, and if it's his turn to speak and his narration matches the current limits of what he's allowed to say, then hey, more power to him. This sort of game often has very exact conflict resolution rules - <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, for example, dictates when your character lives or dies or escapes alive, and it warrants that any influence the characters have over these major conflicts comes only by engaging and resolving minor conflicts between the player characters. Those major conflicts notably are not attached to any sort of in-game task-type action, even if the minor conflicts might be seen as sort of brushing against the moment-to-moment action; your character in Zombie Cinema dies when his pawn gets into the wrong place on the game board, and you're required to narratively justify the death after the fact.<br/><br/>As you can see from the above three paragraphs, there are plenty of games that have explicit conflict and task resolutions, as well as games that only have one or the other. (Games without either are also possible, they're just very zany and experimental and rare.) An important point here is that even if there are games where these resolution modes are not made explicit, the resolutions still occur, and the line between implicit and explicit is totally blurry. The step from a non-conflict resolving task resolution system to a conflict-resolving task resolution system is as small as deciding that from now on, every task that is resolved will correspond with a conflict that is also resolved, and no exceptions. (This is largely what Burning Wheel does, by the way - those rules about "letting it ride" and other limitations for the GM in executing task resolution are meant to bring transparency into the conflict resolution process, making it impossible for the GM to get interpretative about things.)<br/><br/>Thus, the answer to the original query: combining task and conflict resolution within one game is possible, and you're probably doing it in your game in some manner. The important technical point is <i>how</i> you do this; there are fun and unfun procedures for resolving conflicts and resolving tasks, and for some purposes the fun ways are specifically such that they attach the conflict resolution steps directly to task resolution steps. What people usually mean when they say that they "resolve this situation with task resolution and this other situation with conflict resolution" is that the former situation did not have an appreciable conflict present, and thus no conflict resolution was engaged - the task was resolved for some other purposes, which also happens often even in games that use explicit conflict resolution. In both Burning Wheel and Solar System (similar games in many ways) there are plenty of reasons for engaging the task resolution system without resolving a conflict at the same time. Typically these are preparatory tasks that establish setting and situation and character and provide further mechanical advantages in the future, when conflicts are actually being resolved.<br/><br/><a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/en" rel="nofollow">Solar System</a> is my current magnum opus on this sort of basic "we already hashed this out in 2004" Forge theory put into practice. I think it's pretty clear about making the distinction between task and conflict resolution and how the latter largely runs by activating the former at appropriate moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255122/#Comment_255122" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T20:11:34+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  8:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Upon reflection, I should clarify that I don't want to close out the possibility of conflict resolution outside the dramatic narrative framework in the above - I just chose that particular definition because it should be simple to understand and will catch about 80% of all discussion about this stuff. I myself support the view that you can have conflict resolution without a narrative framework as well; the concept of dramatic actor just needs to be expanded to cover all types of protagonism in roleplaying games, which is a wordy thing to do, and should anyway be pretty self-evident if you first understand the above as it pertains to the typical sort of game discussed here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255128/#Comment_255128" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T21:42:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2010  9:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2010 9:43PM by Nameless.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to keep this pretty short, because a lot has already been said. I think that it doesn't distill enought though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTask resolution addresses the "What are you doing?" Conflict resolution addresses the "Why are you doing it?" If you have a system that puts both of those on the table, and requires that players and GMs abide by the ressults at both levels, then you have both task and conflict resolution, and they are not at odds.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple of examples not cited so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nDogs in the Vinyard. "Why" is addressed before dice are rolled when you set the stakes. Then the dice get rolled and bidding starts. As you narrate, specific tasks are resolved with each bid, and more dice can be added for Traits with the proper narration. Each action must be addressed as a separate task, and each contributes to the the overall conflict. Task and conflict resolution all roled into one. This is my personal favorite resolution mechanic, and I think that it can be hacked for much justice into other games.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; 4e. This might be controversial, and isn't specifically outlined in the core rule books well, and they screwed the whole thing up at first anyway, but people play it this way where I come from. Skill challenges are both task and conflict resolution. Each roll is a task. It can succede or fail. Each success or failure contributes to the total accounting of victory, the conflict. The full skill challenge can be set up as a conflict in the sense of conflict resolution, as long as you set stakes at first. Agree on the "why" before starting, and it is conflict resolution. Make each task count, as well as have a chance for both success or failure, and you have a task resolution system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255136/#Comment_255136" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-04T23:13:37+00:00" title="February  4, 2010 11:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Eero's definition better than all the other definitions, because I think I kinda understand it.

Many other writers have used the term "task resolution" when they've meant "explicitly mechanized task resolution emphasized on the expense of building up a coherent conflict resolution system". I don't find removing this unnecessary juxtaposition a big deal, the intent behind the theory is just clearer this way, and discussion can be more direct. Miles and miles of tedious theory debate have been written just because some people quite legitimately can't wrap their heads around "task resolution" when the term is used for a type of game structure instead of its historical pre-Forge meaning of "this thing we do to find out whether my character succeeded in hitting". I'd like to see more discussion where the two phenomena of "how we resolve whether my character hits" and "how we determine which things are important, and then resolve them" are separated and considered in isolation; that's what I took away from those Forge discussions, and it seems to work as a framework without contradictions in my own design work.<br><br>There are many good reasons for having the GM decide things in all sorts of games. Pure-bred Forge-influenced games usually have GM-made decisions inserted in important places insofar as they have a GM role at all. While a narrativist game usually can't survive with GM-controlled conflict resolution (he's just too stupid to make good calls in that context, frankly), different types of games could even use GM fiat for that particular part of procedure. For example, <i>Dread</i> is an excellent game that almost directly advocates the idea that the GM should choose the outcomes of any conflicts to support the immersive atmosphere of the game. It's not quite written out in the text, but I personally think that any rpg text that just gives you a task resolution system and tells the GM to decide when and how it's used is making a tacit invitation for the GM to control how conflicts get resolved and when.<br/><br/><i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and 4th edition D&amp;D skill challenges (as well as combat; 4th edition has complete conflict resolution rules, it's just a pain in the ass to improvise conflicts in it) are both good and clear examples that have very explicit conflict resolution procedures that are internally run entirely by chains of task resolution routines. The extended conflict in <i>Solar System</i> works the same way. The event track (or whatever its name) in the new Warhammer is also an universal conflict resolution procedure (it names a fictional conflict and tells you when and how it's resolved) that is resolved by taking several rounds of task resolution as input. This is really a quite common set-up, mostly due to D&amp;D originally (as this is how D&amp;D combat works) and then later due to <i>Heroquest</i>, which was the first game to give a really powerful restatement of the D&amp;D system into an universal resolution mechanic. There are also games that always use only one task resolution cycle to resolve one conflict (Sorcerer sometimes, SS simple conflicts, etc.), but the above games might be better examples for my thesis because it takes no effort to see the task resolution happen when the conflict resolution basically consist of "make task checks, deduct points from a score until your enemy runs out, claim victory".                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255144/#Comment_255144" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T00:20:51+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 12:20AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David's right also, of course, but he's approaching the issue on a somewhat different, pedagogical level. On theoretical level we can just note that if somebody plays your rules wrong because they're in habit of misreading rpg texts to fit their preconceptions, then that's on their head.<br/><br/>While the misreading phenomenon is real, I think that many games through this decade have made good with introducing conflict resolution to traditional gamers. D&amp;D, Warhammer, Heroquest, TSoY, Burning Wheel, even Exalted in its second edition introduces a social conflict model (even if it is a pain in the ass as I understand it)... it's getting to be so that the games that only have combat conflict resolution (which has always been with us in nearly all games) are soon a distinct minority. Nowadays I expect new game texts to have at least procedural advice about using the task resolution system to resolve conflicts, even if there are no mechanized rules for it. The clearest hold-outs are the games built on an ideological GM fiat underpinning, like Guardians of Order stuff used to be - obviously enough you don't want explicit conflict resolution if you have GM fiat, as the latter already determines how the conflicts are going to be resolved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255175/#Comment_255175" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T06:54:56+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  6:54AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's definitions make sense but are a bit complicated.  What I was talking about in my original post was pretty much what Lee said.  When I say "Conflict Resolution", I mean setting stakes, perhaps making a single roll to reconcile a conflict which might encompass multiple discrete actions.  When I say "Task Resolution", I mean rolling for each individual task in the process without setting stakes ahead of time.<br/><br/>Practically, I'm asking because we're drifting WFRP 3e and I'm wondering what negative implications could arise.  The system at its core is expressed as Task resolution in the rulebook, but makes a marvelous Conflict resolution system if you play it that way.  Combat, however, is entirely task based and can't be drifted much without lopping off large parts of the system.<br/><br/>David's point is interesting.  While I can imagine suffocation occurring I'm not sure that would happen in my group.  I'm also interested why you think that mixing of the two will cause one to revert to old ways and cause the game to suffer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255177/#Comment_255177" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T06:58:56+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  6:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>When I say "Conflict Resolution", I mean setting stakes, perhaps making a single roll to reconcile a conflict which might encompass multiple discrete actions.</blockquote>\nThe main problem I had with this definition is that there are plenty of systems that do exactly this, but which everyone screams at me are task resolution and not conflict resolution.

What you are talking about is a social drift where we "ignore" failures because of high whiff factors in some historical task resolution systems. But in truth the failure is part of the fiction. <br/><br/>In what sense is the task resolved with a failure different than the conflict resolved with a failure - just the fact that we have a retry rule in one case and not the other? What about the fact that in the exact case you are talking about the rules (don't recall which edition) said you don't get a retry until you gain a level? Does that make it conflict resolution suddenly? <br/><br/><br/>More generally, I often find the structures of task and conflict resolution blurring (outside of the culture of aggressively framing a conflict that is). After all, if a conflict is resolving why you are doing what you are doing, then why not just do a Dogs conflict of "I become a well respected retired dog and settle down vs I die in shame and doubt of my faith." <br/><br/>Clearly that conflict is too big, so you seek out smaller ones. But at the same time, your task "judge the sinners of the town" will get resolved over a series of those littler conflicts.

You want to add stakes setting to the core mechanics of a fairly traditional RPG. I'd say there are three situations where this has varying levels of impact:<br/><br/>1) Actions without well-defined defined mechanical outcomes on broader events. The traditional RPG defaults this involvement to GM fiat / interpretation of the situation including private details. The result of replacing the GM fiat with negotiated stakes will be fewer GM secrets, greater player agency, and a unconsciously negotiated power shift in the importance of these sorts of actions (which could mean that become all important, or even less useful than they once were).<br/><br/>2) Actions with explicit mechanical impacts to broader events in the fiction. One obvious example includes attacking someone in D&amp;D. These actions already satisfy some of the goals of stakes setting - so there is a risk of setting up counter-intuitive effects by combining them. As long as the effects of the action mechanics and stakes are kept parallel though this should not be an issue. However, there is an alternative, you can hack away the original action consequences in favor of the stakes - but at that point it seems that you might be better off simply building a stakes setting game from the ground up.<br/><br/>3) Mixed actions, with some fiat impacts and some mechanical impacts. Investigative skills are notorious for this, especially since it will be difficult to fully distribute a GM's role as session planner from a traditional game using this hack. In this case it may be difficult even with stakes setting to excise the fiat impacts entirely. In practice though, I doubt this will be much more influential than the problems with more clever stakes setters having an advantage in a stakes setting narrative mechanic. <br/><br/>One additional concern overall, stake setting is also an intensive process, involving some negotiation and the existence of counterfactuals for players and GMs alike (fictional states must be temporarily entertained which will in fact become false). This puts an additional cognitive strain, which when combined with the mechanics load may prove too costly. Ultimately this is something that only playtesting and group preferences can fully verify.<br/><br/>Does this help address your problem?<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255232/#Comment_255232" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T12:36:05+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 12:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>There was an extensive discussion about this on The Forge several years ago.

I'm evidently not exaggerating when I say that this issue has been completely hashed out as far as I'm concerned some five years back.<br/><br/>As for Charles's intent in asking the question, my answer is also affirmative - as we've touched on above, it's entirely possible to take a task resolution system and include a conflict resolution system on top of it, just the way he understands these terms. One of the simpler solutions for this purpose is "identify a conflict of interest between characters, pick a suitable ability, narrate a task that we'll agree will resolve the conflict, resolve the task, have the conflict be resolved in the best interests of whoever won the task resolution". This method is nearly 100% non-mechanical, so it can be put into the GMing advice part of a rulebook without touching the mechanical portions of the rules at all.<br/><br/>Another very simple and common way to make task resolution into conflict resolution is the one we also mentioned above, by using the combat system: any combat system that actually ensures that the combat will end conclusively is already a conflict resolution system that only resolves conflicts by force. (I'm assuming here that life and death of the player characters is usually a conflict worthy of the name.) This is why Mendel notes above that it's complicated to hook a new conflict resolution system onto combat procedures in Warhammer - the combat procedures themselves are already part of the game's internal conflict resolution system, so adding another system on top is liable to run into annoying contradictions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255285/#Comment_255285" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T23:32:39+00:00" title="February  5, 2010 11:32PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On theoretical level we can just note that if somebody plays your rules wrong because they're in habit of misreading rpg texts to fit their preconceptions, then that's on their head.</blockquote>\nI work in Management, which lends itself to thinking in terms of marketing.
