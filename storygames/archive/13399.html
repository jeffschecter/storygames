I had split the work between two different computers, and a mix of two versions of Indesign, two versions of Microsoft Word, and Google Docs. Somewhere between transfering files from one to another to another, the quotations got screwed up, and playing around with the settings wouldn't fix it. It even got to the point where Word wouldn't even spellcheck the damn thing.<br/><br/>When I do a revision, I'm plannning on just doing it all on my computer at work, to avoid conversion problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302179/#Comment_302179" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T14:15:12+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  2:15PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the credit!  I don't deserve it!  But thanks!<br/><br/>Negative criticism first:<br/><br/>Half the fun of LB for me was the way the characters point to each other in positive ways - everybody's got a reason to help at least one other character.  So you get funny situations like Kale is rummaging for loot in a Hand of Sorrow storeroom, the Lady tells him to stop delaying them, he refuses, but then the Lady tells the Captain, the Captain says "Come on", and Kale's like, "Yes sir!"  So I'd worry there might not be enough reasons for the PC's to help each other baked in.  The only ones I see are Ruprecht -&gt; Konstanze and Briiesh -&gt; Horatio. <br/><br/>The cap on magic power is...odd.  I dig where you're coming from, but if I'm reading it right, it means you can use more dice for a mundane feat (I slay the demon with my sword) than a magical feat (I slay the demon with a bolt of lightning) - which, (in the case of aforementioned demon killing, for example), makes your mundane means more effective, which might make magic seem less magical.  So - I'm not sure you need the restriction, your pool dice naturally act as mana as they are, but if you really want arcane stuff to be mechanically different, you might want a whole 'nother pool of magic dice, or a pile of "mana chips", instead of conflating two ideas into one variable. <br/><br/>And, now some big positives:<br/><br/>Only allowing you to use your pool dice if you have a fitting tag on another trait is neat.  I bet that'll make the play a little less free-wheeling which would totally fit with the gritty, dark feel you've got going on here.  <br/><br/>Merging the keys into the tags is neat too, this is a place where I think simplification really makes sense, really open up some interesting possibilities.  Any tag can be a liability!  And there really is a price to your character growth - you don't get to use that tag anymore.  <br/><br/>I'm going to roll both those things into Blackbird Pie.<br/><br/>And the art's great.<br/><br/>Want to play this over Skype or Infrno sometime?

And you did deserve credit, since you helped me think of Lady Blackbird in some different ways.<br/><br/>One of the things I had to temporarily scrap was a way to better work in relationships as part of the Trait/Tags. What I may do is have relationship Tags be sort of a generic, "add to the Trait you deem appropriate" thing. But I figured someone would have a good idea here and there, and I could absorb it as it came to light.<br/><br/>As for the magic, my thinking is that by its very nature, supernatural abilities inherently allow you to attempt things that may not be possible with more mundane abilities. With magic, you can change shape, steal memories, immerse yourself in fire, etc., whereas you can't do that with, say, your skills as a lawyer or your noble bloodline. Maybe this bit'll have to change. We'll see.<br/><br/>And man, I wish I had time to play this online. Between my work and a dozen small side projects that I'm working on (including two webcomics I'm helping with and trying to finish a few more games), I can't even go to my normal game sessions anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302197/#Comment_302197" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T15:24:18+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  3:24PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2010 3:25PM by jdfristrom.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the way you've made the pool dice work, I think you could totally give a "Konstanze's Cousin" (or whatever) tag to a character and have it come up in play.  They'll spend pool dice to hit that tag.<br/><br/>But you don't need mechanical weight - with the people I play with, simply saying "Konstanze's Cousin" on the by-line would be enough to get them saying, "I'm not leaving my cousin behind!" and "Don't do it!  My uncle will never forgive me if I let you face a vampire alone!" etcetera.<br/><br/>That's a good point about magic.

Maybe I'll add that in to the next version, like Louza being Konstanze's long-time childhood friend. Though Gruthmundr would be tough to tie, relationship-wise, to anyone, just because of who he is. But then Snargle of the original Lady Blackbird was similarly unattached, it seems. Their connections are merely "professional."<br/>I do think, though, that with a new version, I might draft up some kind of relationship-map generator thing for people making characters from scratch, so there isn't this whole, "You look trustworthy! Join our group!" thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
