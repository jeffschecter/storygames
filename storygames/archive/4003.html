But in that time I have seen what <b>appears</b> to be a real inflating of game prices.  Last year I used to see a lot of content at $12-17, with the occasional $20-22 product.  My first indie purchase was Burning Wheel Revised, which was (and still is) <i>two</i> fat-assed books for $25.  That was a lot of value for the money to me.<br/><br/>This year I've been seeing a lot of games in the $20-30 range, and some very small (12-32 page) games for $8-15.  <br/><br/>I'm not posting this to be an ass.  I am just curious whether: A) Printing costs have increased considerably, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> The indie gaming market will suddenly pay 20-50% more,  C) There's more content either print/artwork-wise that I'm missing, or D) I'm an idiot and don't know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Some of you seem to have done a bit of purchasing at Gen Con.

If it didn't, then I was going to charge less. it ended up being closer to 120 pages, so $20 it is.

For me, there's a certain dollar to fun ratio thing going on. Past my personal "buy price," there'd have to be exceptional circumstances for me to fork over my cash. I have a bunch of RPGs already, which I love. There's only a handful of them I want to play more than once. There's even fewer which I have the chance to play repeatedly. So what's the benefit to me in spending money for something I might not even get to enjoy?

It means a few things:\n<ul>\n<li>Authors of really good, popular games can be properly compensated</li>\n<li>Authors of not really that good games won't get an equal share of sales just because they're associated with the community, requiring them to work harder</li>\n<li>Authors trying to break into the market can actually compete on price</li>\n</ul>\nAnd what folks have said above rings true - a good RPG gives way more rewarding play hours than a video game that costs 50%-100% more.<br/><br/>Having said that, there's an issue that extremely focused indie games with low replayability run into. One could argue that $120 for the D&amp;D PHB, DMG and MM, or whatever the HERO 5er tome costs, provides far more potential gameplay than $120 worth of narrowly focused indie games, which would mean between 4 and 5 games on average - which may work out to something as low as 8-10 sessions of actual play in some cases. <br/><br/>So maybe the epic campaign-based games won't provide the same average <b>quality</b> of play per hour, but certainly more hours for your dollar. Either way, it's an argument that could be made, which may be worth considering.

This meant my children were home. I can't work in front of the computer for hours at a time and effectively watch my kids, so I worked when they were at day care and at camp. So I put them in day care and camp extra days so I could sit in front of my computer and finish my game. These things cost money. So does my internet connection and computer, which I need to publish, publicize, and sell. And I also have to pay my mortgage. And buy groceries and cat food. And put gas in my car so I can drive to GenCon and sell the game. And eat at GenCon. And sleep in a bed in a hotel at GenCon. And drink rum and coke at GenCon. So I didn't have to do the last one, but as you can see, taking time away from life to design a game costs money. Taking a game public costs money.  I have too many mouths to feed to starve for game design. So my $20, under 60 page book seems like a fair price--a bargain even, given how many hidden costs there really are. I just about break even all things considered.<br/><br/>Add to that, small publishers print their books in small batches, which cost more. Big name publishers who can print 10,000 copies or more at a time pay a fraction of what a similar sole proprietorship publisher pays for a similar book.<br/><br/>Personally I'm willing to shop locally from locally owned stores for things I want and need rather than get the alleged bargain at Walmart. Buying indie games from people I can actually meet has the same appeal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89623/#Comment_89623" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T21:35:37+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  9:35PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As others have described, I think you're seeing a result of more games being sold through fulfillment houses like IPR, and even occasionally moving into distro. <br/><br/>There was a time when the only one stop shops for a lot of indie RPGs were the Burning Wheel crew flogging our colleagues' games at all the cons we attended, and also the Forge booth at Gen Con. Other than that, you pretty much had to order directly from each individual producer.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of convenience to the consumer in being able to go to a place like IPR or Key20 and pick up multiple games they want. But the producers must pay a percentage of their revenue to the fulfillment houses in return (and pick up shipping costs, in the case of IPR). If the book goes into distro you could be selling twice as many books while seeing greatly reduced overall profit.<br/><br/>We can get away with selling games at cut-rate prices when we do everything direct and we still see the majority of the revenue as profit. But as the games become more popular and we shift to organizations like IPR to handle our fulfillment, it starts to become unrealistic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89632/#Comment_89632" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T00:15:58+00:00" title="August 23, 2007 12:15AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also under the impression that indie authors lately have much more confidence in what they are doing. <br/><br/>So, they tend to want better prduction values (because they are proud of their product). Also, they have more confidence in themselves and their role of game designers and publishers, and so they are stopping the habit of setting the price very low...<br/><br/>If you think of it, a 150 pages booklet from a good indie designer has the same "fun value" of a 300 pages hardback "traditional" publisher.

AT GTS the year before last I talked to a retailer who told me she though that most of "those Forge games" should cost about $5 more. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a matter of percieved value as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel $20 is the exact right price for Classroom Deathmatch and Panty Explosion. Matt and I based this on content, page count (106 and 96) and book size (9x6), production values and play value. I've never had anyone complain about the price, and judging from the amount of books we sell, price isn't keeping anyone from buying our games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't think of a single worthwhile indie game that I think is over priced. I can think of several crappy games (indie or otherwise) that are overpriced, but that's because they fail as games or products. If Beast Hunters sucked it wouldn't be worth $20. It rocks, so it is well worth the asking price. I don't think many indie games have really reached the point where their asking prices are to questionable. I do think we've reached the point where we all can't just buy a game JUST becasue it's indie. And that's a good thing, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\njake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89646/#Comment_89646" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T02:56:08+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I live outside the US, I get hammered for postage on everything I buy from IPR or anyone selling stuff in the US.

And in my estimation quite a few authors seem to be trying to fix this discrepancy (using various meanings of the word fix) by increasing the "production value" of the books rather than increasing the quality of the product in ways that might actually enhance gameplay. This leads to an observation/principle: <i>An increase in the production value of a book, on average, decreases the price to gameplay ratio of the book, detrimentally to the consumer.</i>. This to me is a BAD reason for price increases, and is leading to me buying less games (the all-important brain surgery victim market). But it is a factor in the trend, and sweeping it under the rug will probably only encourage the trend to continue (it is also one that our consumers, for some reason, are encouraging; I think the "ooo pretty" factor leads people to say "yes, more art, please" regardless of the detrimental effect on the play/cost ratio).<br/><br/>That said, there are some good reasons being mentioned here as well. I doubt the cost of printing has gone up $5+ a book, but the increases in the costs of printing do need to be addressed and considered. There's also general cost of living inflation, and the (perceived, at least) belief that many designers were underpricing in the first place.<br/><br/>The use of fulfillment houses such as IPR seems to be an empty argument - as a justification for an increase in prices, it falls completely flat. I didn't increase my game's price because of IPR, and won't - what they are doing is getting <b>Fastlane</b> to more people than I ever could at home by myself. So what they charge, I make up by an increase in sales. That balances out, and usually comes out ahead in my experience (the extra sales, I mean). People using this as a justification seem to fall into 3 categories:  (1) People who haven't really thought it through, (2) people who seriously think that they could distribute their games just as well as IPR/etc could, or possibly (3) people who are thinking with their wallets instead of their heads or hearts.  <br/><br/>And for those people in the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> category, if you really think you could get the exact same sales numbers without IPR or whoever, why are you choosing instead to jack up your price and use them? That doesn't seem very nice.<br/><br/>Part of this, too, is not rational for me. I don't mind the prices going from a standard $12-17 range to a $15-20 range. But those books over $20? I really start to wonder about something if it needs more than one standard ATM-bill to pay for it ($20s are the standard for ATM withdrawals, so they're how I view purchases, even though most of the time I use a card). It doesn't help for me, on a personal level, that I feel my biggest regret of the 2006 was also the one over-$20 book I purchased (or at least the only book whose over-$20-ness I noticed even at the time, and am still kind of bitter about).<br/><br/>But there is an inflation strong enough that my purchases per year are going down, despite the # of new products per year going UP. And a lot of this seems to go back to my first point: people are bloating their prices through production values that do not have any impact on my gameplay (hardcover, art, color interiors...).

If that's your biggest regret of 2006, you had a better year than I did.<br/><br/>But, as someone whose game has undergone a massive improvement in the production-values department (or so they tell me), I don't see the harm in it. After all, technological advancement has allowed me to release a book with more content and better artwork, for less money (and a lower sticker price). I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying that as a developer, I'm happy that my new book looks a hell of a lot better than my old book. It was worth the extra money to make it look better. And I think it's going to improve my sales (though, obviously, some people aren't going to be as impressed with the layout or art, which is fine).<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that RPGs haven't really increased in price the way everything else has. I got some paperbacks from the eighties here, and they're all about three bucks apiece. Nowadays, a paperback's about eight dollars. Same goes for the hardcovers on my shelf. Ten or fifteen bucks became twenty-five or thirty.<br/><br/>My 2nd Edition AD&amp;D Player's Handbook was twenty bucks (says so on the back). Most of the RPGs I bought back in the day were about twenty bucks. So, we should be looking at forty or fifty bucks as a starting point, right? But we're not. The price of RPGs hasn't really increased all that much. I'm no economist, so I can't say why that is. But my gut tells me that it's because consumers still think that twenty to twenty-five bucks is a reasonable price.<br/><br/>So if independent developers want to charge more for their work, I say hell with it, why not? If you can put out a cool book and break even (which is what I'm hoping to accomplish), then charge whatever works for you.<br/><br/>*shrug*<br/><br/>That's my two pieces of electrum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89706/#Comment_89706" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T07:20:24+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  7:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 7:24AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you price your book wrong, a sale from IPR to a retailer can approach a net loss.  <br/><br/>An argument against the utility of increasing production values is about ten years behind the curve.

Oh well, I think it's still valid.)</i><br/><br/>I also pretty much completely disagree with you, Alexander.<br/><br/><b>1) Production Values</b><br/>First off, you can't fault anyone for putting business practice before idealism. If making books more beautiful sells more, what's wrong with that? It's fine that you don't value that, but not everyone feels the same way.<br/><br/>Beyond that, there are legitimate reasons for increasing production values. Pretty books attract non-indie gamers. We want to spread our goodness to the masses, don't we? Let's face reality---Kinko-printed books aren't perceived as "legitimate" products, simply amateurish. Production values also, *potentially*, have educational value. I think the illustrations in Polaris do a really good job at communicating the color of the game, as well as being inspirational. That's how I approach production---how does the production of the book contribute to communicating the game? And if someone *does* have a solid game, what's wrong with showing it up? As a consumer, I like pretty things.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all just saying that there are legitimate reasons for investing in production values. I will agree that in recent times we've had some development issues with some books. I think many people, both publishers and consumers, have learned from this. I think consumers are becoming more selective, and I think designers are working more on "finishing" the game itself.<br/><br/><b>2) Printing costs</b><br/>I think the cost of printing books has increased $1-2/books, at least (for short-run printing).<br/><br/>Lulu is also an issue here. Lulu wasn't around 5 years ago. Everyone had to do short-run or traditional printing. And Lulu is more expensive. If you're willing to cough up the money, you can get 100-200 copies of B+W book printed at $3-4 (maybe cheaper). But that same book will cost $6-8 at Lulu. The point is that printing though Lulu probably *is* $5-6 more expensive than the average book 5 years ago.<br/><br/>Also, the price scheme for selling books is a percentage. IPR takes a percentage, and retailers take a percentage. Retailers are more significant. They take 40-50% of the cover. That means that any increase in printing costs will actually get doubled by the time the consumer sees the book (given that the publisher wants to keep the same net profit). Example---the price of printing a book is raised from $4 to $5. The old retailer price was $8, now its $10. So $1-3 increase in production prices makes the new price $2-6 higher.<br/><br/>And retailers are buying our books more and more. Isn't that one of IPR goals? So publishers *do* have to start worrying about fitting into the traditional price scheme. In the past, retailers weren't an issue, so people could price their books how ever they wanted.<br/><br/><b>3) Fulfillment Houses</b><br/>I, personally, don't buy that the argument that increase the number of sales enough to off-set lowering your net profit. There's no guarrantee of that. And even if they did, why should I care? The promise of increased sales is really the promise of increased profit. If I'm not going to make more money, why should I worry how many copies of are sold? I could post it for free and get thousands of downloads.<br/><br/>My point is that it's cool you don't mind lowering your profit in exchange for increased sales, I respect that. But I don't feel that way. I want to maintain a certain net profit per book. That means I have to find ways to off-set the price of the fulfillment house, the easiest way being to raise the cost of my book.<br/><br/>And it's unfair to say people are necessarily "thinking with their wallets". Increased sales means an increase in work load for the publisher, as far as responding to consumers' questions &amp; concerns. If a publisher sells twice the number of books, and has to answer twice the number of questions, it's fair that they get paid twice the profit, not just 1.75x the profit or whatever the difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89727/#Comment_89727" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:06:11+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jenskot:<br/><br/>Just as a brief comparison (I have to run off soon) let me compare two products by the same publisher, with similar systems:<br/><br/>Burning Wheel vs. Burning Empires.  <br/><br/>They are both excellent systems, excellent games.  But the former (Burning Wheel) has an excellent cost/value ratio, while the latter (BE) has a...not-so-excellent cost/value ratio.  BW and BE are similar but not identical, different facets of the same gem, so this is probably one of the best comparisons one can make - the play experiences between the two products can be said to be of similar quality (and in my experiences at the conventions, and also at home with BW, I feel that this is the case).<br/><br/>While some of the price differential might be attributed to systematic changes (BE has stuff BW just does not have), most of the price differences between the two products can be attributed to BE being (a) hardcover (just like a paperback, but more expensive!), (b) it being chock-full of art, and (c) it having a glossy, full-coloured interior (and with my understanding of printing costs, it appears that each of these are being inflated between production and the final product, leading to more money in the designer's pocket - and in the case of (a) at least, this is more money in the designer's pocket simply for checking 'hardcover' instead of 'paperback' on the form when going to the printer).<br/><br/>There are other games that seem to be going these ways - look for games that advertise themselves art-first. There's at least one designer at the convention this year who said something in response to this rant that, I feel, boils down to "I don't care, it sells more games."  I'd name a name if I could remember the original quote - and be sure which person said this to me. It was a very crazy convention, and I'd rather not wrongly attribute a possibly mistaken summary and impression to the wrong person.<br/><br/>Jason:<br/><br/>I agree, by the way, that good art and good production design have their place in instruction and pedagogy.  But my argument isn't against the potential utility of production values. It simply states that <i>on average</i>, as far as the choices I see actually made by designers that are publishing currently, these choices are not made for instructional reasons <b>nearly as often</b> as they appear to be made for reasons that seem to more boil down to "ooo pretty."  I am not condemning every bit of art or other increased production value that has ever appeared in any game at any point. I am noticing that the trend, at least, is to do it just to do it, or for prettiness reasons (and the associated inflation between what the publisher pays for prettiness and what he passes on to the consumer) rather than usability or pedagogical reasons.<br/><br/>I get this impression, by the way, from art-first advertisers (who, by advertising their game by their looks, are communicating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to me</span> that their system is not something which they think can hold up on their own) and from people who make statements similar to the one I'm referencing above (I wish I could remember exactly what the publisher said, but it was definitely a case entirely based on marketing and no other reason). I also note that "ooh pretty" is more likely to get a game to win awards.<br/><br/>I also, by the way, get this impression from at least some consumers that have said things that boil down to "yes, if it is prettier I will be more likely to buy it, regardless of the quality." Note that there are people even in this thread willing to bend their price limits for games with "more art" or "hardcover" etc - things that are independent of the quality of play a book produces. And I think there is a trend by at least some publishers to take advantage of this "ooh, pretty" reaction on the part of consumers and bloat their books with art and/or other "production values" that, sure, increases the niceness of the book as a shelf-space-holder or work of art (see Nobilis, beautiful coffee-table book) but does not do much if anything for the 'gameplay' side of the price/gameplay ratio (although it might appeal to people of the "book as product" mindset).<br/><br/>Jason, do you believe that, for the games currently in production today, the trend is not towards "production value for production's sake" and instead towards "production value to increase pedagogy and instruction"? Because this is completely the opposite of the trend I'm seeing, both by examining the books and by hearing designers talk about them (and hearing players who have purchased them). <br/><br/>Finally, to address your first statement: if you price your book and IPR would lose money for you, then your book was priced wrong in the first place.  The existence of IPR or other places should not change the price of your book (i.e. "without IPR, price X; with IPR, price Y").  Thus, using it as a reason for an increased price feels wrong. Though I can see a potential 4th category out of your statement - (4) people who priced their books wrong in the first place.<br/><br/>And now, I've waxed too long and must run so I can catch my bus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89729/#Comment_89729" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:12:37+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:12AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>Jason, do you believe that, for the games currently in production today, the trend is not towards "production value for production's sake" and instead towards "production value to increase pedagogy and instruction"?</blockquote>\nI can't judge other publisher's intentions.  Take <i>Cold City</i> - it's physically gorgeous and evocative.  Does that communicate something about the expectations of play?  Is it artistic excess because Malcolm's got a talented crew?  Not my place to decide, but I bought the game either way.  For myself, I'm really concerned about designing for instruction, and spent a lot of time and money to get the art for Grey Ranks just so.  I resisted the temptation to use archival photographs, which would have been easy, and powerful, but would not have done anything to communicate my vision for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89733/#Comment_89733" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:20:57+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:20AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh...snf...they grow up so fast. <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89735/#Comment_89735" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:22:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 8:30AM by blankshield.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  Speaking as a designer: I have, from day 1, priced my products to absorb a retail markup and still make me a bit of money.  That hasn't changed.*  Some of my games have a higher space in there, because I have higher fixed costs in producing them, which I can't** build into the base book price for inventory or costing purposes.  This includes artwork, layout, editing, etc.  So I can either bump the price 5 bucks, and start to turn a profit sometime in the first hundred sales, or I can leave it lower, and need a bunch more sales before I hit break-even - and that's break-even on the product, not break-even as a company.<br/><br/>Speaking as a consumer: I'm a good little north american, and consume across a bunch of different media.  If I take my wife to see a movie, we're spending probably around $30 for a couple tickets and some overpriced popcorn.  A new Xbox 360 game is in the $60-80 range, and the 360 itself was $400+.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows set us back around $45.  Go Play NW rang up a price tag of around $300, and that's incredibly cheap to get to a convention from my neck of the woods.  The gas it takes us to drive to a weekend camping is around $100, I'll be conservative and call it $50 for the food on that camping trip, and $10-$15/day for the campsite.  An average boardgame runs $40-$60, and high production value boardgames will often run from $60 to $100 or even more, for a very few.  Minis for wargaming are often several bucks each for good quality ones, and you can need dozens or more for any given game or even just scenario.  I'm not even going to get into the silly amounts of money people (including me, at times in the past!) spend on CCGs or other collectible games like the clicky figures.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games, by any metric comparing them outside our little niche, are <b>fucking cheap</b>.  I'm OK with this.  It lets me drop $200 bucks - or about the cost of a weekend camping with the family - and get 6-10 games that will keep me entertained for weeks <i>just reading them</i> let along the ongoing pleasure I and my friends will get from playing even just one or two of that $200.  And putting my designers hat back on for a minute, that also discounts the learning and benefit I get from keeping up with new games and new ideas to improve my own games.<br/><br/>James<br/><br/>*Blood and Bronze <i>Without Peer!</i> is an exception to this rule.  I can't absorb a retail markup on that.<br/>** By the standards of operation and laws in my area.

Some would even say cheap, though I resent that myself.<br/><br/>The most expensive PDF game I've purchased is PTA for $12. I'd be very hard pressed to pay more than that for a PDF game - I know that 100% of my payment will go directly to the author, and there is a cost associated with printing if I want a printout. $5 - $7 is closer to the mark I want to pay, especially for a sub-60 page game - it's low enough to hit impulse buy status, but high enough that the author will appreciate it. If I print, I do so on 2 x 2 x 2 pages / letter-sized sheet (i.e. 8 pages per sheet) and put them in a duotang. That way I keep the costs down, and more importantly, I don't take up much shelf space.<br/><br/>When I pay money for a book, I want a piece I can put on the bookshelf, walk by each day, glance at and feel good about. Something eye catching, that my friends would instinctively want to reach for when they come over. Ideally, something I can peek at now and then just for inspiration to run a really awesome thematic game. I paid $60 (CAD) for Burning Empires without even knowing if I liked it, because it <i>looked</i> and <i>felt</i> awesome. I still haven't played the game - it's not even on my play radar - and I'm not even sure if it's a game I like, yet. I still consider it a good buy.<br/><br/>While I agree that a good game is in very large part due to game design and writing (=ability to convey your game design) - my eye-opener was a text file of Dogs in the Vineyard, sans layout, artwork and the tactile experience of holding a hardbound tome - there is considerable perceived value for the consumer (or possibly, for some subset of consumers like me) in a book with high production values. A book - that is, a physical item - is more than just a printout of rules; keeping it on the shelf is a statement, like buying a super-detailed large prepainted D&amp;D mini. That mini may cost you the same amount as all the rules needed to fight it, but you're not buying the mini just for the gameplay - you're buying it because you want to make a statement about your hobby, show something to your friends, and have something pretty to look at every now and then.<br/><br/>On the other hand, digitally distributed works - IMHO - should be cheap as hell, production values and all. They cost nothing to print or distribute. Why the heck are you people selling PDFs through a fulfillment house anyway? Just to offer different payment options for the consumers? Or does IPR etc not take a cut off PDF sales?<br/><br/>When I buy a PDF, I want the rules. I don't want gobs of flavour text, or artwork, or super-pretty tables. All these things cost me money to print, and if I wanted it I would've bought the book. Save your mulah on producing the PDF, sell it for cheap to lots of people, and make me a pretty book to buy if I want to put it on the shelf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89738/#Comment_89738" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:41:58+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:41AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 8:48AM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Roleplaying games, by any metric comparing them outside our little niche, are<b>fucking cheap</b>. </blockquote>\nMmm. Could I give you a different perspective? <br/><br/>A new indie roleplaying game costs me about \xc2\xa313*. From experience, that game could be any of the following:<br/><br/>* A great game I'll play several times<br/>* A good game I'll play once or twice<br/>* A hastily-released game that'll be replaced by a fixed version in a year's time<br/>* A badly-written game, which I won't enjoy reading, but which I'll eventually figure out how to run, and it'll be good<br/>* A game I'll read once and never play<br/><br/>Let's say that, on average, my \xc2\xa313 will give me a couple of evening's enjoyment.<br/><br/>I could also get an evening's entertainment from:<br/><br/>* A \xc2\xa35 bottle of wine<br/>* A \xc2\xa35 book<br/>* A cinema trip for \xc2\xa36<br/>* A DVD for \xc2\xa313<br/>* A rented DVD for \xc2\xa35-ish<br/><br/>...and, on average, they'll be more <i>reliable</i> entertainment.<br/><br/>Now, of course, all this means is that I <i>don't</i> buy roleplaying games "on average", I buy very, very carefully. <br/><br/>It also means that, if something costs more than \xc2\xa313, I have to be <i>really</i> sure it'll give me lasting entertainment. If you charge 30 dollars for your game (about 20 pounds, by the time it gets to me), I wait to play it with someone else before I buy.<br/><br/>So...yes...if I consider the average amount of entertainment I get from a roleplaying game, it's not <i>cheap</i> unless I'm very selective.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* That's a 20 dollar game, by the time it gets to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89744/#Comment_89744" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T08:58:21+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for the great feedback here.<br/><br/>But I see a few folks drifting this into a discussion either about perceived value ("an XBOX game costs $xx"), or justification of pricing ("I'm entitled as a designer to make a little money").

If you want to compare Burning Wheel with Burning Empires, you must compare Burning Wheel + Monster Burner + Burning Sands: Jihad against Burning Empires. Burning Empires contains large portions of all three books.<br/><br/>Secondly, the color art is part of the game design. That art is there to communicate the color and setting of the game. Each image says more than a raft of words. The art is <b>important</b>. Burning Empires would not be Burning Empires without the full color art. And once you're going there, the cover is a negligible expense.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Burning Empires was priced to go into distribution. We have far too many orders to process them ourselves. So we need a fulfillment house. The fulfillment house takes between 10 and 20 percent off the top (IPR, for instance, comes in at the higher end after fees and shipping costs). Then the distributor takes 62 percent off the top. And the retailer is buying from the distributor at a heavy discount. All told, once you move into distribution, you're doing well if you're getting back 20% of the cover price. Of course, out of that 20%, you've got to pay for the book itself.<br/><br/>Depending on the size of your print run (which affects your cost per unit), a book that's $45 retail ends up earning you somewhere between $3.50 and $5 profit.<br/><br/>It's your right not to like it.

And it's great: it's superb that indie designers can publish glossy, professional-looking books and there's a market for them.<br/><br/>The negative side is that it's not just the good games that have gone up in price and production values. Games that <i>aren't</i> quite as good can also sell, as a handsome book, for $20.

This is not what I'm trying to say. If you really feel the need to discuss this further, please let's take it to a new thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>It's your right not to like it. There's no gouging involved.</blockquote>\nI've never claimed any gouging is happening. Only that there is a price inflation that outpaces the additional gaming goodness involved in these books.  I also feel that BW vs BE is a fair comparison, because both books are designed to play more or less out of the box. Yes, there are things in MB and Jihad that BW doesn't have and BE does.  There are also things in BW+MB+Jihad that BE does not have. These, in my estimation, wash out.<br/><br/>Second - if the color art was truly <i>necessary</i> for awesome gameplay (which is the sole criterion by which I personally am judging value, as it compares to cost), it would feature in demos, con games, and home games. I can't speak to home games but I can say that in two years worth of BE demos and con games, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not one bit</span> of color art was used at the table. The awesome gameplay happened <i>anyway</i>.  <br/><br/>The color art is there for, what I'm sure are excellent reasons - but those reasons do are not reasons that have direct effects on my gameplay.  (And the cover is still not a negligible expense.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but in my research I've seen hardcovers quoted anywhere from $3 to $6 extra in production price, which translates to somewhere between $5 and $10 in final price - <i>that</i> fucks with the gameplay vs. price ratio without even the potential ephemeral benefits that extra art and color interiors can be argued to add).<br/><br/>Sorry, I'm ranting again.  Stopping now. This rant was not the reason for my reply.<br/><br/>Nowhere am I saying that BE, or any other game that chooses that level of production values, are "gouging" or any other negative or accusatory statement like that. Making choices for economic benefit is not a bad choice to make. I am not a large market, in and of myself.<br/><br/>What I <i>am</i> saying is that, as far as the <i>game</i> itself goes, production value usually gets passed along as a cost to the consumer without any better <i>game</i> involved. I fully understand that there are people out there who have reasons OTHER THAN the game to purchase a gamebook (note the comments consumers have made about wanting a nice looking product, a gamebook to put on the shelf, being willing to put out extra money for extra art, etc. - the "ooh, pretty" factor, as I'm calling it). I do not begrudge anyone making the choice to appeal to consumers for whom these are positive factors.<br/><br/>However, despite these other reasons one might have for getting a book (reasons that turn these factors into positive factors), they do not usually change the price/gameplay ratio in a way that improves the 'gameplay' side of the equation, and almost never change it in a way that increases the gameplay anywhere near the amount that price goes up. In other words, the prices are going up for reasons <i>other than the gameplay</i>.  <br/><br/>Valid reasons, assuredly; certainly not reasons that amount to "gouging" or any other nefarious behavior. Reasons, in fact, <i>encouraged</i> in this community by many more voices than my one discouraging voice. But these are explicitly reasons <i>other than gameplay</i> and should be acknowledged as such.<br/><br/>And as the ratio slides more away from the gameplay side, me personally (and perhaps only me) am less likely to purchase the resulting product.  For me, what I'm buying is the system and other material that I would use regularly at the table to produce my awesome gameplay (and/or cannibalize for my own designs, which ideally also provide awesome gameplay). A hard cover, a lot of art, glossy color interiors - these are things that provide <i>other services</i> to the consumer besides awesome gameplay, several of these which have been noted above.<br/><br/>If we want to take this any further, it's likely best to make a new thread that links to this one. I'm hoping my points are finally clear, and that people stop reacting defensively. There is no accusation of "gouging" or otherwise unethical behavior in my statements. There is just an acknowledgement of what I feel is a fact: that there are choices in game book production other than ones involving providing better gameplay, and these choices often impact the price. <br/><br/>And currently, to bring the topic back around, the trend I'm observing is that the price increases in indie products are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in part</span> because they are making more choices (and feel they have more room to make choices) that involve production in ways other than providing better gameplay (choices that more "industry standard" products make <i>all the time</i>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89891/#Comment_89891" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T14:27:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have to agree on the PDF comment, too. The incremental cost of selling 200 PDFs is almost indistinguishable from the cost of selling one: practically nothing. <br/><br/>That's cost of sales, obviously, not cost of production, and producers need to consider supply-and-demand and all that economics stuff. But I think a PDF priced over, say, $10 is overpriced, given what you're getting (and I could do without the art, too, generally).<br/><br/>Then again, an art-free layout different from the layout for the printed book is extra work for the producer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89923/#Comment_89923" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T16:36:19+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  4:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander:<br/><br/>Okay, so just checking:<br/><br/>Book design is meaningless.<br/>Setting is meaningless.<br/>Color is meaningless.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Anything else meaningless?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89933/#Comment_89933" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T17:18:09+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  5:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't want to derail this thread but.... what the heck, let's derail it. Because I think that the direction it's going will never arrive anywhere. It's obvious that the designer of an awesome game that you will play forever has earned more that a few dolllars. And at the same time it's obvious that if I play a game a lot, I would get my money's worth and much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem, and it's strange than only Graham (I think) talked about this, is that not all games are awesome.  We, all of us, have brought a lot of games that we will never play, or that we played once. When one game like this cost to you a little amount, you can forget about it or even be happy anyway to have the object "game" to collect. But when that game cost a lot of money, you begin to be much more careful with your purchases.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany had said that this would be a good thing. I agree. But ONLY in presence or a hard, rigorous and honest critical environment that would inform the purchasers about the games he could buy.  If not, it will not be quality that will win, but name-recognition.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if I go to gen-con with 300 dollars in my wallet to buy games, and I find $600 of new games at the forge booth, it doesn't mean that you have a 50% chance to sell me something. FIRST, I will have to buy the new Vincent Baker game. The new Ron Edwards game. The new Matt Snyder game, the new Paul Czege game, the new Mike Holmes game, and the new games of the other half-dozen game designers that I buy everything of. Because I already trust them. THEN, If I have still 20 dollars left in my wallet, I will look at the other 320 dollars of games on the shelves, and I will choose one.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr not. At that time, with so much new games to choose from, and a backsack already full and heavy with new games to try, I think I will simply leave with that $20. If I don't recognize a game that I read about and I decided that I wanted absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBigger prices doesn't mean that I will play less. I will play the same number of times. It will mean, though, that I will be much more careful, less prone to risk on an unknown game. Because for that money, I am not buying a way to have awesome games. I already have that. A full shelf. What I am buying now is a lottery tiket to win, if I am lucky, an even better game. Or a new door holder, if I am unlucky. And for every mistake I will do, buying the wrong game, I will be much more careful than before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games WILL cost more. I don't think this discussion (or any discussion) could stop it. It's the way the market works, and Indie games were really underpriced. But this mean that the pumping of the competition for the last dollar in the gamer's wallet, too.  You can't afford to be "all awesome", because then, nobody will be "more awesome than the rest" enough to get that dollar.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Sorry for the long-winded rant, but this subject gets me every time...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89939/#Comment_89939" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T17:51:44+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  5:51PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I don't want to derail this thread but.... what the heck, let's derail it.</blockquote>\nHow about you start another thread with this instead?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
