They are expected to make poor decisions, at least from the perspective of the character, that will create excitement, drama, pathos, or what-have-you.  In <em>IAWA</em>, for instance, approaching a situation with your weak stats \u2014 trying to talk something out when you're much better at punching in the face \u2014 is incentivized over going with your strong stats.  You get your name on the Owe list, and you can tap that for dice or appearances later.  In our recent playtest of <em>Fiasco</em> (AP coming, Jason, I swear), I felt like I should be doing the same sort of thing.<br/><br/>I feel like this is a sort of common thing, but I'm having trouble coming up with further examples.  I appeal to the good people of Story-Games for more.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm curious how folks' experience with this phenomenon relates to the Czege Principle ("authoring and controlling your own opposition is not fun").  It seems to me, and this may be a personal perspective thing, that this sort of play borders on, but does not fall under, the principle.  This isn't authoring and controlling outside adversity, but it is a sort of ratcheting adversity and introducing internal complications.  Does this jive with others' experiences, or am I the crazy man on this one?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193021/#Comment_193021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T23:34:06+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 11:34PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do Fate's Compels fall under this for you?  When I put "Sucker for a Pretty Face" on my character sheet, I can actually put myself in a difficult situation either in response to a beautiful NPC or even actually introduce such an NPC that hadn't previously been described as being there (and then have it cause my character problems) in order to win Fate Points to power later endeavors.  I'm not controlling the opposition exactly but it was "fated" from the moment I made my character sheet and I've certainly authored it in that sense.<br/><br/>It's late and I'm tried but I read your last paragraph a couple times and am not actually sure what you're asking.  You're accepting the "Czege Principle" as true but then pondering on counter-examples that either support a contrary position or are the exceptions that prove the rule?  Or that you feel might be perpendicular to the principle?<br/><br/>In my groups we are sometimes in a mode where we're honoring the tropes we're playing with with such conviction that our characters' situations and decisions sometimes feel predetermined to me in a way.  We're collectively authoring the opposition that makes sense for the issues they're "meant" to deal with.  But it's still very fun for me.  And even then the dice/cards can throw you for a loop.  Any system with hazard has that potential regardless of how much narrative authority you have over your opposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193023/#Comment_193023" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T23:42:24+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 11:42PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell, this problem goes all the way back to picking GURPS disadvantages.

Still, I generally know what side of the line I'm on during a gaming session...because one side is fun and the other is not.<br/><br/>For example, if we're playing a roaring twenties game and I've defined my character as a playboy wastrel who never met a redhead he didn't like, I'm going to be just fine with all the grief that's sure to come from trying to bed the ginger-haired moll who usually toddles around on the arm of the local tommy-gun-toting rumrunner.  If there are no dangerous redheads in the game, or never any consequences for chasing the wrong redheads, I may be disappointed.  Similarly, if <i>every</i> girl is nothing but trouble, I will quickly get bored and stop putting any effort into that part of the character.  I just can't stay interested in hitting the same beat over and over and over again.  I want whoever's putting these dames in front of him to mix it up a little: mostly bad results are okay by me as long as at least a few are good, and I don't mind at all being surprised by which ones turn out to be which.<br/><br/><br/>What I don't want to do, and what I resist doing, is demanding or actively providing the obstacles for my own character.  I'm not going to tell you "So, Tommy-Gun Marcello's best girl is a foxy redhead named Lola, and when I hit the speaks tonight, that's who I'm going to go home with."  I'm not going to say "Oh, the DA's secretary should be exactly the kind of girl I go for."  I'm not going to suggest that the random flapper I drank too much champagne with last night should come back to me the next morning with incriminating photographs and a blackmail demand.  Me handing that to you just so that you can hand it back to me is not fun.  And, I suspect, it means less to you than if you were to say "Okay, so I should put a redhead somewhere in this for the playboy wastrel to tangle with" and come up with your own scheme.  (At least, that's how it works for me when I'm providing obstacles for someone else; the more input they have into what obstacle I should hit them with, the less invested I am in that obstacle.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193031/#Comment_193031" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T03:06:22+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  3:06AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2009 3:20AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeez, I should probably address Josh's <b>actual question</b> at some point, shouldn't I?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Okay, so in some games, players are expected to make things harder on their characters.

I see what the system is trying to encourage me to do, but I'm also focusing on the actual conflict...and in most cases I'm only in that conflict because I want to win it.  My usual style of play has me only going into conflicts where there's something I care about on the line, and as a player, I genuinely don't want to fail in those contests.  I put my character into that situation because I wanted him to win, and so it really messes with my head when the game mechanics are saying "you should make things worse for yourself right now."<br/><br/>What happens is that eventually I start trying to cheat the system.  Instead of playing the way I usually do and only gunning for conflicts that matter to my character, I start looking for things I could turn into conflicts that I absolutely do not give a shit about.  I look for ways to disguise what I really want as a player from everyone else at the table, so that I can B'rer Rabbit my way to a double victory.  ("Oh no, I fail and now I guess I get thrown in the briar patch; what a drag, but since I lost, at least I get some bonus dice in my pool now.")  I stock my character concept with trash that I <i>want</i> to see destroyed, and use them as an ablative shield to protect the few elements that I desperately want to preserve at all costs.<br/><br/>And yes, that sucks.  It sucks for everyone.  I waste braincycles thinking about how to work the system to my benefit and end up not enjoying the game as much, and I'm just not a good enough liar to pretend that I'm enjoying it (nor do I want to lie to my friends about something like that).  Worst-case scenario, my antics end up breaking the game: I rig everything to my advantage, selling dearly what I would give away for free, and I end up throwing off whatever economy is supposed to keep my character in check.<br/><br/>There's obviously something important I'm missing when it comes to those games, some psychological gulf between "I want my character to face adversity and succeed" and "I want my character to be knocked around by adversity and then go looking for more" that I can't quite figure out how to cross yet.  I don't know how to find the fun over there, not yet at least.  For the most part, I just avoid playing that style of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193033/#Comment_193033" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T03:32:34+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  3:32AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite><br/>Specifically, I'm curious how folks' experience with this phenomenon relates to the Czege Principle ("authoring and controlling your own opposition is not fun").

Does this jive with others' experiences, or am I the crazy man on this one?</blockquote>\nThere is a clear line here, and some games fall on different sides of the divide. I discuss this issue nowadays with the useful term <i>advocation</i> (got it from Mike Holmes, I think): the Czege principle only holds for games that are <b>a)</b> narrativistic and <b>b)</b> based on the technique of character advocation. The "advocation" here is a very generic technique (a "technical agenda", certainly) of play wherein the game has been set up to address premise by assigning one or more players to specifically play certain characters in the story. Furthermore, the advocating player plays in a specific way: he strives to express the choices and passions of his character to the game group, and he makes these choices based on character integrity rather than other priorities. The movements of these characters withing the boundaries set by the rules of the game then produces drama in an advocation-based game without any single player necessarily having a major hand in plotting anything at all.<br/><br/>Advocation-based games are a very important slice of narrativistic roleplaying, so much so that I'm not entirely unsympathetic towards claims of superiority by the proponents of this set-up. The Czege principle sort of touches on this: advocation is usually discarded by games that make the individual player responsible not for the character integrity and expression of individual characters (advocation), but for the well-being of the entire story. This could be seen as a more generic restatement of the Czege principle: advocation (fun) flies out of the window when you force an individual player to take responsibility for the perceived narrative quality of the story (to provide adversity for his own character). This seems to cause the creative agenda of the game to shift into simulationism, too.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint it should be pretty clear why I find narrating your own character's defeat in <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> unfun on Czegean grounds while I don't bat an eye at choosing a suboptimal conflict venue in IaWA. One of those solutions forces the player to take responsibility for the perceived well-being of the "story" as an external entity, while the other just allows the player full freedom in advocating for his character. There are a multitude of reasons for the PC in IaWA to choose different conflict venues, and those venues are an important means of expressing the character (one half of the advocation role, as noted above): the fact that my character is bad at acting for others is, frankly, rather inconsequential when doing so regardless is sure to drive home the point about what my character is doing in the scene and why. This has nothing to do with providing external adversity or otherwise plotting story, and everything to do with advocating for my character.<br/><br/>The reason for why I've been thinking on this is that it's very common for people new to Forgean narrativistic games to start creating their own, and the first efforts seem to more often than not run into a wholesale destruction of the advocation technique. For some reason people get excited by the techniques used in these games and then make their own with very similar techniques but with no believable basis for any sort of advocation, which then results in a lukewarm conch-passing exercise. I've had to develop vocabulary to explain why I don't like these games and what would need to change to make them work for me. Interestingly enough, not everybody agrees; some people specifically want a game with no advocation elements, one that resembles Once Upon a Time more than anything else.<br/><br/>(Note also that games that use advocation do not necessarily have all the players in advocation roles, nor do the players necessarily stay in those roles constantly. Gift dice decisions in TSoY are made according to audience priorities, not advocation, for example. What matters is functional movement between roles, not that advocation is enshrined )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193052/#Comment_193052" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T07:18:23+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  7:18AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Does this jive with others' experiences, or am I the crazy man on this one?</blockquote>\nHere's the thing, I've never actually been in a game where people resolve their own conflicts.

I didn't know you guys played.<br/><br/>This is definitely an issue for me, because I tend toward player-provided adversity in my games.  That's how I play, so it's pretty natural.  The crews I play with tend toward putting the screws on their own guys.  Objective success is rarely a goal, while memorable, catastrophic failure is sometimes actively sought out.  This can get pretty murky in binary resolution systems - I want my guy to fail, I succeeded, so ... he fails?  I tried to address this in Fiasco (tell me if I succeeded) by firewalling establishment from resolution (you don't get to do both; pick one) and allowing the resolver to choose success or failure on whatever terms they like.  It's worth noting that this has been the single hardest thing for playtesters to manage, which is probably a result of both the murkiness I mentioned and inadequacies in my text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193060/#Comment_193060" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T08:01:48+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  8:01AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This can also happen in situations where it's not clear whether rolls = player success/failure (i.e. narrative control) or character success/failure in a given action/conflict.

The advocation is all about "he'll do this with love and for others because he's a good man, a caring man with a strong heart and true" and not about "well, my high dice are a d12 in with violence and a d10 in directly, so I'm gonna beat that hobbit bitch until he begs me to not hit him anymore." If he can win with love and for others, then good -- but even if he loses the character has been allowed to do his best as who he actually is. <br/><br/>Which yes, also means I don't look at the sheet and plan to use my low dice either. I use the dice that fit who the character is in that moment, because that, rather than winning or losing, is what I'm advocating for. (Of course, I do want the character to win -- but only if they can win by being that which they are.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193090/#Comment_193090" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T10:46:56+00:00" title="February 18, 2009 10:46AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>Eero, the player, go about finagling ways for your character to be in situations where he's not using his strong suit.</blockquote>\nIf I'm not mistaken, IaWA depends on strong GM play and strong play from other characters pressing conflict on the PCs.  In other words, the Players shouldn't be finagling characters into situations -- situations should fired at the charater and, as Brand describes, the Player decides how his character will react to a situation<i> not of his own creation</i>.  (Which is how the whole Czege Principle thing comes into play.)<br/><br/>FRODO: I'm leaving the Fellowship.<br/>ARRAGON: Whoa! Don't!<br/><br/>Whether or not Frodo is a PC or an NPC, PC Arragon's Player didn't set the situation up.  However, he's now got a situation to deal with, and the point of the play is to reveal who the character is when caught up in a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193100/#Comment_193100" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T11:28:57+00:00" title="February 18, 2009 11:28AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I'm gonna beat that hobbit bitch until he begs me to not hit him anymore.</blockquote>Is it wrong that I want to read this version of the Lord of the Rings?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

I just do and roll what feels appropriate based on my advocacy for my character's drives and passion..  The We Owe list, to me, is a thematic marker that says something about my character in retrospect.  It's not something I pursue actively.<br/><br/>In case it's not clear "advocacy" does not mean, "do the best thing possible."  It simply means allowing your perception of the character's drives and passions to dictate your decisions about what they do next.

That's what scenes are for.  Sometimes this is done in an "OhMyGODFuckSHIT!" climactic sort of battle, and sometimes its how a father takes the time to tuck his daughter into bed.<br/><br/>Certainly it's what I play for.  <br/><br/>Thus, choosing between whether a PC uses his strongest trait or a weaker trait reveals who the character is.  As Jesse says, it's not "do the best thing possible."  It's "I could do the 300 version of Lord of the Rings and beat the snot out of Frodo to get him to do what I want, but I won't, because that's not who I am, so I'm taking the riskier approach by talking to him."  <br/><br/>The point of using the smaller dice (or the larger dice) is that it's tied to the fictional/color attribute that define who the character is.  That's the part that matters when choosing the dice.  Not the winning or the losing; its about revealing the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193110/#Comment_193110" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T12:05:54+00:00" title="February 18, 2009 12:05PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2009 12:06PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At DexCon last year, I played Ganakagok, with Bill (the game's designer) running it.  During one turn of play, after another player had done something that called for dice to be moved about, I picked up the dice and said, "Can I actually move these to a WORSE position for the characters?  I think we could do with some more adversity about now."  <br/><br/>Everyone stared at me like I was crazy.  Bill said, "You can if you want to."  <br/><br/>I said, "If that's against the spirit of the game, I won't."  <br/><br/>He said, "No, I don't think it's against the spirit..."  <br/><br/>So I went ahead.  My decision didn't wind up having any great impact.  I did get called a "filthy GM sympathizer" a few times, though.<br/><br/>A while after this, I had a good conversation on the Forge about PtA, and why not to just play it as a story workshop, pushing for whatever might be cool next, your character be damned.  Jesse chimed in with a point about how <i>participating in the system of conflict supported by the mechanics produced a "game" experience with some tension and uncertainty</i>.  I thought about that, agreed that it was fun, and now I think I'd approach that Ganakagok situation differently.

In fact, this is how I parse mechanics like the Owe list - it's not there so you may exploit it and rule the roost, it's there to suggest and emphasize choices you might not otherwise make. Also, as Vincent's said somewhere - it allows us to save the interesting characters for new exploits while the monotonously victorious ones are forgotten. This is exactly the same as any other mechanical triggers that inform consequences of choices you make for the character. Some consequences are positive, others are negative - how are you to really grasp the risks a character takes by his valiant last stand if you don't understand the cruel combat system, for example? Mechanics provide consequences, in that regard something like the Owe list is no exception.<br/><br/>So I <i>could</i> choose to to take the losing choice to get on the owe list and still be advocating, provided that the reward just happened to open my eyes on something I hadn't realized about my character before. It's not a hard and fast divide between blind method acting and cynical calculation for perceived advantage; anything that allows you to express the character in a more powerful manner and develop his character integrity works fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193113/#Comment_193113" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T12:15:50+00:00" title="February 18, 2009 12:15PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Can you give an example of a game that grants narrative control (player success) without<span style="text-decoration: underline;">requiring</span>the player to narrate character success?</blockquote>\nPrimetime Adventures gives narrative control to the person with the high card, even if their side in the conflict isn't successful.

A perfectly valid way of playing, which still is <em>not</em> the same as "authoring my own opposition"; because my opposition, in this equation, is built into the system itself: the temptation to go for the short-term goal, using my biggest dice and not aiming at getting on the list, is the opposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193227/#Comment_193227" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T08:45:07+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  8:45AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2009 8:46AM by PaulB.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My preferred method is definitely in the Fate self-compel arena: Do something that complicates your character's life but nets you some long(er)-term benefit -- future mechanical advantage, spotlight time, etc. So that'd include:<br/><br/>* Self-compels in Fate games, even if you have to haggle with the GM a bit (if the GM sees you're being sincere in your effort to complicate your character's life, it's usually a nonissue)<br/>* Earning checks from Traits in Mouse Guard<br/>* Earning Fate from Traits in BW/BE<br/>* Extra cards/redraws for "negative" character bits in Dust Devils, with the codicil that the negative bit makes a meaningful appearance in the game fiction<br/>* Buying "enemy" relationships in BW, because that ends up buying me special spotlight time<br/><br/>For me, just fucking up my character's life to make an aesthetic statement about the character doesn't really work.

I just played in a game recently where each character made statements about out mutual father (all the characters were half-siblings), most of which made our lives harder because it made the game more interesting. Turns out our father was a pretty rotten guy, which certainly made everyone's life worse, for no other reason than it set up a great story.<br/><br/>I think this falls into the very important 'authoring but not controlling' category. The players mess up their lives as a starting point, basically to tell the GM "hey, grab this and hammer on it, I think it'll make a good element." I think you see it less during play (as opposed to during setup), but I've certainly had any number of characters who have made non-optimal choices for roleplay reasons, with various degrees of support depending on the system. I guess it all depends on how you phrase it, for my characters I feel more like it's giving the GM the rope to hang me with (authoring, not controlling).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193251/#Comment_193251" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T10:27:24+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 10:27AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2009 10:31AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I see all that.

So there's certainly a payout for that. So maybe that's not a great example.<br/><br/>Mmm...I've played in groups where players would do self-destructive or suboptimal stuff because that's "what my guy would do." They felt like they were making a statement by doing it, but their play style/agenda/whatever was so out of sync with everyone else's that it didn't feel like a statement, it felt disruptive. They were probably angling for spotlight time, but what they got instead was negative attention. Which I guess is better than none at all.<br/><br/>Mostly what I'm referring to is "my guy" stuff: "Oh, while everyone else is getting ready for the big bank heist, I'm off getting high. Because I'm an addict. So when it's time to pull the heist, I'll probably screw everything up. In fact, yeah, let's just assume that my part in the heist is going to fail in some spectacular way." Even that's not <i>awful,</i> in the right context and with the right group, but if it shows up and it's disruptive -- uncool.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193258/#Comment_193258" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T10:59:03+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 10:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Okay, I see all that.

It helps that situation-setting of that sort all happens in a separate phase, when I'm not "advocating for my character" <i>yet</i>. In fact, she's not really "my character" yet, at that point.<br/><br/>That's why some people call it a "pre-play" or "prep" phase, I believe, despite being an integral part of the game. I fact, some players I know fiercely despise it, and prefer games (or scenarios) in which the "prep" has already been done for them.

Maybe the character is the only "point of contact" they feel with the SIS? I don't know... I usually enjoy the "situation setting prep" phase as part of the game, but then I usually enjoy formal game mechanics as their own sort of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193271/#Comment_193271" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T11:44:20+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 11:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And just for clarification, the thing that I'm getting at in the OP \u2014 it's in-play, not pre-play stuff.

That's why I was trying to nail this down. Because it <i>is</i> different.<br/><br/>So, here's an example.<br/><br/>Last night I was GMing my <i>Sorcerer</i> in <i>Traveller's</i> Third Imperium game.  One of the PCs ("Zee" Fujita) is struggling to keep a priestess away from a mob (the PCs merc crew had actually been hired to defeat the army of priestess, and the mob is actually the folks he's been hired to fight for, but for Zee's own reasons, things are now complicated.)<br/><br/>The mob grabs the priestess away from Zee. The player could back down now and go to a defensive position to jockey for more dice for the next round... But if he doesn't get the priestess back right now, she's going to be pummeled.  So he decided to press his effort to protect the priestess, rolling only one die for his efforts, and most likely setting himself up for penalties the next round.  <br/><br/>He is determined to protect the priestess, so even though the odds are worse, he presses forward using only one die in his effort, needing to roll a 10 on a d10 to pull this off.  <br/><br/>Of all the options, mechanically this is the worst thing he could do.  Narratively, this is exactly what he wants to do.  Mechanically, he could play it safer.  Narratively, that option doesn't interest him; in terms of how he's feeling Zee would behave, Zee isn't going to be playing it safe.<br/><br/>Before I discuss more, is this the kind of thing you're talking about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193277/#Comment_193277" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T12:06:22+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 12:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Of all the options, mechanically this is the worst thing he could do.

I'm sure someone does, but I've never played with those people.  You mentioned <i>In a Wicked Age </i>in your first post, but certainly -- as has been noted -- the game isn't about doing that.  Even Paul's example about the drug-addict fuck-up is all about "what the character would do."<br/><br/><br/>So, have you seen this kind of play in action?  I'm more than willing to believe there are people who believe people play this way... I'm just wondering about the actual people who do.  I'm not saying it doesn't exist -- it might be a Black Swan that we haven't found yet.  But since I can't imagine it making sense or being fun, my imagination falls short and it seems too exotic to be probable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193283/#Comment_193283" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T12:41:20+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 12:41PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Technically I figured when I got kidnapped I'd just have one separate session as a sort of make-up thing with the ST when I got back, and it would be mainly to explain my absence... this is not what it ended up being, but my expectations for spotlight time/stroking (mmm spotlight stroking) were not high!  It's also not uncommon, in that game, to have mini sessions with a subset of players, whether that be 1 player 1 ST, or 3 players, etc. so it wasn't a weird request either. Well ok getting kidnapped is weird, but still.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you're looking for, if everything is mechanics and everything is a reward.<br/><br/>Is the only thing left the things you do 'because your character would do it' that piss everybody off - since that's not rewarded by the group?  But it is rewarded in its own way with self-righteousness and the feeling of 'playing it right.'<br/><br/>Anyway, I get my kicks by having things go horribly wrong and pulling through somehow anyway, and since I'm in long-form campaigns, very little of the original setup is left!  In fact, part of the fun is being changed by the experiences.

Basically, the player wins narration and then uses it to hose his character even when the rules say he "succeeded".  I don't like it when this happens because, quite frankly, it marginalizes my job as GM in those kinds of games.  I stop having anything to do because the players are busy antagonizing themselves.<br/><br/>At OrcCon I ran a game of UnSpeakable which is a variant of InSpectres.  The idea is that when you roll a 4, 5, 6 you get to narrate the outcome.  HOWEVER, my reading of the rules is that outcome should be positive and furthering your character's goals and making progress in the overall mystery.  On 3, 2 or 1 the GM narrates with the opposite constraint of that bad things should happen to the characters and set backs and misfortune should enter the situation.<br/><br/>But what sometimes happens (and it happened a few times in my UnSpeakable game) is players for whatever reason start narrating bad stuff happening even when they succeed.  Not just "adding depth to the mystery" but actual antagonist level stuff like, "As I take my final reading my ghost detector explodes because the readings are off the scale and now the room is on fire!"  or whatever.<br/><br/>Taken to an extreme in these games the GM literally stops playing the game because the players just bounce the antagonism around the table themselves like a beach ball.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193304/#Comment_193304" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T15:16:28+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  3:16PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.  I forgot about InSpectres... which was designed to do exactly that... but it's been a while since I've played it.<br/><br/>I'm going to say -- and this is is probably crazy since I have to review the rules -- that the InSpectres, with it's comedic spin, is in a very different league than most games.  The comedian is looking for ways for the things to go bad even while his comedic persona survives.... So... I think there's something there.<br/><br/>But then UnSpeakable is the same system and hands us similar results, apparently.  But, I wonder, how invested were the Players in the fiction of "What my guy would do?" (as Josh phrased it).<br/><br/>That is, when I played InSpectres, I had a blast. But I had a blast because I was making up crazy shit in the narrative form of a keystone comedy.  Which is a specific form of storytelling that requires a <i>distancing</i> from the characters so that we can laugh at them.  (Students of comedy, take note.)<br/><br/>I wonder if there's something about the rules that encourage this distancing, as in: "Here we are playing at the form of a horror story," which is, of course, completely different than being invested in the characters in a horror story?  <br/><br/>I have not read UnSpeakable and make no claims to know. I am saying I'm changing my statement from above: I <i>do</i> see the appeal of playing that way, but it's about making a different kind of story.  There are many kinds of stories.  Some of them require a light touch and sometimes a distancing from the characters.  Other times, this distancing from the characters makes everything fall flat.  Tricky stuff.  But I can see the appeal now.

The phrase I've used is manipulating the story as an artifact rather than letting it be the result of clashing passionate characters.<br/><br/>I've seen the phenomenon in more serious toned PtA games and not just in comedy games.  Stakes are set as, "Does my character seduce the married woman" and the player uses narration not only to narrate the successful outcome of that conflict but then tack on, "...and that's when her husband walks in."  Or Stakes are, "Do I kill the villain" and then using narration, "Yes, but in the same hail of gunfire I tragically kill my girlfriend too!"<br/><br/>Quite frankly, this always feels like artificially heaping on "drama."  I really really hate it when it happens.  It never seems like genuine emotion but rather story posturing.  Worse, I think it's led directly the the negative perceptions about "Story Now" being all about melodramatic "story making."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193320/#Comment_193320" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T16:40:05+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  4:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2009 4:42PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, <br/><br/>I'm with you 1020% on all your points.

So it's not a choice that has no benefit, because the benefit is "I find this fun."  Or at least, that's what it looks like from the outside.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193769/#Comment_193769" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T15:46:58+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  3:46PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There needs to be a strong line between two things here:<br/><br/>Thing 1) I introduce short-term harm for long-term benefit.<br/><br/>Thing 2) I introduce harm that will never have a benefit.<br/><br/>Further, we must acknowledge the difference between benefit to character and benefit to player.

We <i>rationalize</i>. And take a great pride in our ability to do higher math.  But rational as a species in our decision making.  Nope.  I just don't see it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't expect it from characters.<br/><br/>This isn't me knocking human beings.  I'm perhaps knocking the value of rational -- the world is complicated and I'm not sure "rational choices" are really on the menu a lot of the time. <br/><br/>There's a little idea I've been pushing forward, though I don't think it will stick: The point of these choices is to reveal who the character is.  That's what choices and crisis and whatnot are for stories.  They're certainly how I use choices and crisis and rules in RPGs.  Now, I play for the things I play for, so that's me.<br/><br/>By the way, this isn't me disagreeing with Josh.  This is my grabbing his phrasing and saying, "Yes, some of you out care about this apparently.  Others of us are focused on something different."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Making Things Hard on your Character: the Boundary of the Czege Principle - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8726/making-things-hard-on-your-character-the-boundary-of-the-czege-principle/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Making Things Hard on your Character: the Boundary of the Czege Principle - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8726/making-things-hard-on-your-character-the-boundary-of-the-czege-principle/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I also think I failed to address your point to a degree, Josh.

The decision may originate with me the player, but at some point, the character is "making a decision" as well.  And presumably the character knows that he's better with fists or better with friendship, so he's making a decision on his strong suit or weak suit.

Or, you can choose not to make it the character making that decision. You don't have an either-or decision to make with IAWA, either. You have to choose two of twelve things. Are you saying that the character is considering twelve options and selecting two, each time, in-fiction?<br/><br/>Also, you can fictionally choose to thump someone with love or exploit your friendship with violence. Nowhere on the sheet does it say "friends or fists." Nor in the fiction is your character saying aloud or to herself "I'd like to take this biscuit out of my sense of love for this character, but instead I'll do it because I feel violent about him."<br/><br/>The player makes the decision, then imputes that into the fiction. If he can't make a given action make sense for one modality, he chooses another he can. If you're ever in the position where the mechanically smart thing for you to do is something you cannot possibly make sense of in the fiction, then you choose whether you want to privilege you game-mechanical choice or your sense of psychological verisimilitude. I'd suspect that's rather rare, though. Monkey brains are good at making patterns, especially when both halves of the things being fit into the pattern don't have any existence outside their own heads.<br/><br/>But gaming the system in IAWA--if that's what you choose to do--doesn't require that characters act irrationally or in psychologically unrealistic ways. It just requires you be creative before you cement and finalize what you imagined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_193799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193799/#Comment_193799" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T17:41:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  5:41PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2009 5:42PM by AnonAdderlan.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wasn't Elfs designed around this kind of play?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>The thing that confuses me is when players do it in the middle of play, with or without mechanical benefit for doing so.</blockquote>\nThey do it for the same reasons kids who play with dolls and action figures do.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>but I've never seen a situation where, for example, a player rolls a worse skill for no other reason than to make the game harder.</blockquote>\nThis could be because failure in most systems doesn't result in interesting stuff happening, but in nothing happening at all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Creating trouble and drama at the cost of character (and in turn story) isn't going to help any game.</blockquote>\nDepends on the kind of game you're after.

First of all, I'm not trying to criticize <em>IAWA</em> at all.  I rather like that game.  I simplified the decisions involved (two out of twelve rather than either-or, of course you are right) to get to the heart of the matter \u2014 the decisions that I make as a player, mechanically incentivized, mirror decisions that the character makes in the fiction.  Whatever it is I decide (and however complicated the mechanical decision is), in the fiction the character is deciding to do something.  He's not just a puppet that suddenly leaps into action without in-character reasoning based on what I want him to do.  He's a character, and his actions are his.  If they aren't, then he's not addressing anything, and becomes thematically dead.  In any case, whatever mechanical decisions I make, the character needs to also make decisions that arise from his characterization and the developments of the story thus far.  All that to say that I find it problematic when there's a disparity between the mechanical decision the player makes outside the fiction and the narrative decision that the character makes from within the fiction.<br/><br/>JD \u2014 Shakespeare gets a lot of traction out of (a) ignorance of important details and (b) specific character flaws.  When I say "acting irrationally" I usually mean "acting irrationally in many different and non-unified ways, regardless of in-character knowledge."  You've got a guy who doesn't know the message got through to Romeo, or a guy who unquestionably trusts his daughters love him, I'm not going to call either of those acting irrationally.<br/><br/>Also, the rational self-interest bit you dropped in there, yeah, that's an audience-interest-killer.  Acting rationally in the perceived interests of someone else, though, that's what I call the good stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193806/#Comment_193806" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T18:47:41+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  6:47PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2009 6:52PM by Josh Roby.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>But I'm pretty sure you didn't like it not because Randy made irrational choices but because you didn't like his particular irrational choices.</blockquote>I don't want to stray too far off-topic, so I'll try and apply this as closely to the OP as I can.<br/><br/>The most charitable reading of <em>The Wrestler</em> I can muster is that Randy is indeed perfectly rational and rationally decides that he would prefer the glory of the wrestling ring one last time than to live happily with his daughter (and Marissa Tomei) for the rest of his years.  This makes him perfectly rational, and also an asshole.<br/><br/>The reading that I find far more supported by, say, whats-his-name's portrayal of Randy the Ram is that Randy has no effing clue what he wants out of life, had a good thing going for a while but assumed it would go on forever, refuses to accept that the world has changed and he has changed, refuses to accept that he now or ever had any obligation to his daughter, and basically wants everybody to like him despite the fact that he doesn't actually come through when he says he will, and in the end actually wants people to like him for purely selfish reasons: glory, not anything resembling mutual affection.  This makes him rather irrational... and also an asshole.<br/><br/>You could argue that his Shakespeare-like character flaw is that he does not recognize that he is no longer the man he used to be in the world he used to be in... except the man he used to be was also an asshole.  I just don't buy into the character enough to empathize with him.<br/><br/><strong>To apply all that to roleplaying</strong> \u2014 can you <em>imagine</em> playing any roleplaying game with me trying to play such a character?  Imagine you're the GM.  You throw bangs at me: I'm aging.  My daughter hates me.  The stripper I'm fond of thinks of me as a customer and nothing more.  Here, you can enjoy for one night what it was like to be you twenty years ago, at the cost of every tiny little victory you've had thus far.  And every single conflict, I pay no attention to what you're throwing at me.  I disregard the context of the conflict, I disregard the history of the characters and their relationships, I disregard the consequences that might occur, everything that you've put together as a GM I disregard.  All I do, each and every time I make a decision for the character, is have him (figuratively) pump his fists in the air and shout, "I'm a badass wrestler superstar!  Yeah!"<br/><br/>I suppose you could call that a thematic address.  It's not one that really interests me.  The lack of nuance, the lack of interaction with anybody else at the table, and foremost and primarily the complete disconnect with the fictional reality the character inhabits, makes that "address" incredibly hollow to me.  Does that all make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193807/#Comment_193807" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T19:00:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  7:00PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2009 8:06PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/><br/>Again.

Irrational. Sure. Except, where do you draw the line on what you'll do for someone you love.<br/><br/>Romeo and Juliet are members of warring families have have to know, rationally, that hanging out together will normally lead to trouble.  And yet, they're kids.  In love.  And who am I to expect them to be rational enough to not get involved with each other.  But other people would hold them accountable -- judging them as irrational and wrong because of that.<br/><br/>John McClaine has every reason to leave a building where a dozen well armed men are roaming the corridors.  But he stays.  Is this rational?  Please don't tell me he has reasons or you understand why he did it or you empathize with him.  <i>That's my point</i>.  Whether it's Luke traveling off with a crazy old guy to rescue a princess or Sheriff Brody heading off on a boat to hunt down a giant white shark or Indiana Jones NOT blowing up the Arc of the Covenant when he has the chance or whatever we always can find a reason to "understand" why someone does something foolish.... but that doesn't mean the character's actions are rational -- since there are folks who could easily say, "That's irrational."<br/><br/>At the climax of <i>Die Hard</i>, John McClaine, who is strongest at charging explosively into situations, approaches Hans Gruber submissively, with his hands raised and no gun in his hand.  This is not his strength -- but it's his best shot to stay on the We Owe lost.  <br/><br/>At the climax of <i>Aliens</i> Ripley -- who was reluctant to go on the mission, had to be taught how to fire a gun, and breaks out cold sweat when thinking about the alien -- charges into action with pure brutal energy to save Newt from the Alien Queen.  She pulls it off and gets on the We Owe list.  Was this "rational" -- a non-combat trained first officer charging a monster responsible for taking out a platoon of marines?  Nope... But she does it.  Whether or not we understand or empathize with her doesn't make the act any more rational.<br/><br/>Frodo running off on his own to protect the Fellowship.  Hamlet acting on the instructions of a ghost.  The father in Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Road </i>struggling to keep his son alive even after it's clear the world is over.  The woman who chooses the soulless but very wealthy man over the poor but good hearted man.  Or, the woman who chooses the poor but good hearted man over the soulless but very wealthy man.<br/><br/>This is all I've been saying.  It's in stories.  It's completely understandable in the context of <i>In a Wicked Age....</i> and other RPGs.<br/><br/>If anyone here was talking about something else -- awesome.  But I wanted to clarify what I was talking about. I wasn't talking about "crazy" or "stupid".  I was talking about the fact that we often take actions that can easily be viewed as irrational from a certain point of view, but that are completely understandable and can be understand as "rational" from another point of view.  Such actions make good story and and good story based RPG play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194042/#Comment_194042" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T23:23:11+00:00" title="February 24, 2009 11:23PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, violent agreement!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194055/#Comment_194055" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T01:42:04+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  1:42AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>I'm thinking that GURPS disads and FATE aspects (outside of self-compel) aren't what I'm thinking of.

The setting was Europa a couple of centuries in the future. It was a society with very few people, a clan system of sorts, and an ethic of conservation over the wellbeing of individuals. His character was a proselyte, come from Earth to bring people Jesus once a dome had been built for comfort and faster travel for convenience. He was expecting to show up, eat people's mushrooms, take their electricity, and in return he'd give them Jesus. He didn't speak the language well, had a tenuous grasp on the rest of the culture, and was totally off-base about the sociosexual mores that had evolved over the last couple of centuries in this weird, lonely, freezing desert. Dave really didn't like this guy at the outset. He set him up to be sort of a city mouse in a complex society that he assumed was primitive and just waiting for him to save them.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the next couple of scenes (including, naturally, an apocalypse of sorts), the guy became a totally sympathetic character. He wound up being killed and his wife and erstwhile lover (one from Earth, one a Canny \u2014 a Europan native, living in a can) formed a new moral movement in his stead. If I recall, he piled those dice into his moral movement and didn't use any to save his own life. The character, in narration, tried to stay alive, but totally failed. He was sympathetic because he was trying <em>so hard</em> to not be such an ignoramus. In the end, though, Dave had to choose which he wanted to happen more in the story.</p>\n<p>There was no conflict of interest here. The character was acting in his own best interest. Dave might have even been <em>hoping</em> the character would be OK, but the system never gives you enough dice to make both outcomes likely. It's unlikely enough to get <em>one</em> of the things you want.</p>\n<p>Authority is distributed in Shock: so that you always have pressures on the character. It's assumed that, whatever you want, you'll have to make a choice, and that comes from the order of operations in the course of resolution. And even if your Intent is something like, "I look stupid in front of everybody" (coyly setting yourself up for failure), you still need to choose between that and "The people refuse to follow you." That is, you might succeed in looking stupid and the people follow someone stupid, and now you have to deal with that. Or you succeed and they refuse, or whatever. You still need to allocate dice and you need to overcome the dice and senses of humor of the Audience members.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194827/#Comment_194827" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-27T17:32:04+00:00" title="February 27, 2009  5:32PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what I think it is for me?

The player can then indeed throw the die, using his character's best fitting Trait (or none at all, if non available). Otherwise he can invoke an appropriate weakness, which bypasses the die throw but forces the player to describe an epic fail due to the character weakness. In return the character earns an Hero Point, the basic game currency which can be traded for different advantages later in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in this case:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The player (and the character) <b>were trying to succeed</b>, and only later decided to use the weakness, when the GM required a die throw. This avoids players hogging attention and speaking time to describe narcissist problems and failures affecting their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Although the character fails epically, the fact that the player has narrative control allows him to produce the most personally satisfactory type of failure (kind of the stylish way Indiana Jones often fails, instead of some lame failing).<br/>\n<br/>\n- The player can only invoke a weakness when it's appropriate to the type of die throw, which reinforces the character theme in the group narrative. If you don't have an appropriate weakness for the die throw, you just can't decide to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\n- One can't use this mechanic to "break" the game, since the die throws are always called by the GM, and the GM only calls for die throws when s/he's ready to manage the possibility of success/failure of the die throw.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It's often rational and desirable to play a weakness, specially when the odds are against the character, since although you fail for sure, at least you get more narrative control plus acquire significant bonuses. I find it an intuitive way for players to give color to their character's failings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing of this is original (it's a mix of Fate and Trollbabe failure systems), or perhaps even on topic of the thread, but I find it a good example of how to hose your character without annoying/boring the other players, and/or breaking the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196279/#Comment_196279" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T11:46:31+00:00" title="March  9, 2009 11:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another issue is the success of the overall game or story, which everyone might or might not be concerned about.<br><br>I recently played one of my own games, Land of Nodd, which requires other players to name dangerous consequences for your character. One of the players, when faced with such dangers, would sometimes say, "Wait a minute. My character's leg is blown off? That's not so scary. How about my leg gets blown off AND it means his men no longer want to follow him? That's better. That's <i>really</i> scary."<br><br>He was raising the danger for the character until the overall game and the overall story was interesting enough for him, even though doing that in this particular game could potentially screw his character AND his overall chances as a player.<br><br>As a non-RPG example, have you ever played Chess and had your opponent make a really stupid move... and then asked them to take it back and make "their real move, already"?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196307/#Comment_196307" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T14:02:17+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  2:02PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like mentioned before, one can try to minimize the chances of the players wreaking the game (only ask for throws you can manage), but at the end of the day there should be a basic consensus about what is acceptable or not for the group. If a player is being "difficult" through the way he plays his charecter, he might as well declare his character dead and retire from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8726/making-things-hard-on-your-character-the-boundary-of-the-czege-principle" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8726/making-things-hard-on-your-character-the-boundary-of-the-czege-principle" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8726/making-things-hard-on-your-character-the-boundary-of-the-czege-principle/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8726%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8726%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
