<p>Okay!  First, the Bad-Good-Bad value curve ... also known as "the two-edged sword."  This is any resource where if you have <em>none</em> you're in bad shape ... and if you have <em>too much</em> you're also in bad shape.  But if you have a value that's in a certain range, you're good to go.</p>
<p>I like this.  Those who have played Capes and used Debt know how much I like this, and probably have some notion of <em>why</em>.  Most of all, I like how it takes the sting out of "punishment" ... you punish a player for losing a conflict by giving the character more Debt.  'course, Debt is a resource they can use, but now they've got <strong>too much</strong>.</p>
<p>But for Misery Bubblegum I want <strong>two</strong> of these things operating together.  For instance, in a past version of the game I had Passion dice and Misery dice.  The number of Misery Dice you had on hand was the difficulty you had to beat (in total) whenever you rolled Passion dice, and likewise the number of Passion dice you had on-hand was the difficulty you had to beat whenever you rolled Misery dice.</p>
<p>This worked ... okay ... You wanted <em>some</em> Misery and <em>some</em> Passion, but not too much of either.  Sometimes you wanted to indulge hugely in one or the other, but that constrained your choices.</p>
<p>I really don't know what I want just yet.  I have a feeling that I'll know it when I see it.  Can I impose upon people to jump on board for a brain-storming session?  I sure hope so.  It might help me an awful lot.</p>

                            I'm completely unclear as to your motivations here.  I see what you're saying about a sweet-spot mechanic, and I vaguely recall how Debt works -- and man do I need to go on an indie press shopping spree -- and I see how the Misery/Passion mechanic might work.<br/>
<br/>
Except, first of all, I think I need a little bit more background on when I would roll Misery and when Passion, and second: why don't you like how it works now?<br/>
<br/>
In other words: what's bad about the current situation, and what would be good that's missing?<br/>
<br/>
An immediate thought that occurs to me, though, is this: what if you couldn't reach the sweet spot, due to a continuous/discrete disparity.  By which I mean, if you get dice, the number of dice you have is necessarily an integer; if the ideal number of dice is a non-integer - like 3.5, then you'll always be hovering around the ideal without ever getting there.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if the relationship between the two scales was non-orthogonal, such that adjusting one changed what the other one meant, it'd also be tricky to reach a sweet spot.<br/>
<br/>
I mention both of those because when you do reach a sweet spot, you move into a kind of stasis.  Agora (JBR new playtestable) has something of this, but it kind of works because it's per conflict.  If it were per-character you might be tempted to get "Perfect" scores and then avoid anything that would screw them up.                        </div>

                            The other way to amend the problem that Judson mentions is that using the sweet spot throws it out of alignment to a small-to-great degree.<br/>
<br/>
Like: scale of -10 to 10.  Sweet spot is 0.  Whenever you hit the gas, you get a bonus for how close you are to 0.  Each time you hit the gas, though, your score doubles.  If you're sitting at 0, you add or subtract one.                        </div>

                            I was pretty much assuming that any sweet spot would function in a use-and-lose type of a way.  The result there is that you build up a World Beating Sweet Spot State, and then hang back out of conflict until you need it.  Now you could continue to patch on that and have there be ways to draw characters into conflict, even make Sweet-Turtles more tasty (because let's face it, if you see me wandering around with my Turbo meter full, maybe you decide it's usually better to pick on someone not so well prepared -- unless Turbo meter charge is really yummy.)<br/>
<br/>
What does suddenly occur to me is this: "hysteresis":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis<br/>
<br/>
Not sure how that impacts, but it seems like it would have some really neat application to the problem at hand.  Whatever that it is...Tony?                        </div>

                            I would like to suggest that, if you want actual feedback about your mechanic, you post in very clear process terms how it works.  Otherwise, it's basically impossible to comment.<br/>

Uh... cool idea?  It might work if you did it right.<br/>

                            I completely and strongly agree with Ben, as a general corallary to System Matters, it's very difficult to understand and usefully comment on a system mechanic without a full context on what it's supposed to do.  I think we need at least a partial description of all the immediate relationships to the mechanic.                        </div>

<p>Okay, I wasn't clear.</p>
<p>I don't want help revising the mechanic I listed.  It is listed as an <em>example</em>.  What I want, if people are willing, is some brainstorming on <strong>completely different</strong> mechanics that can also produce the Bad-Good-Bad curve.</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly wrong with the example that I list, and I could probably refine it.  But there may be something way better that I just haven't thought of.</p>

The first time you try to hit it, you roll a d12.  If you hit it, great!  If you're not satisfied, you can spend some kind of currency to roll a d10 and add or subtract the result from your original.  Overshot, huh?  Spend more to roll a d8.  Repeat for d6 and d4.  Or, if you want things to get <i>harder</i> the more you flail at it, start with a target of 3 and a d4 roll, and spend to roll a d6, then d8, d10, d12.                        </div>

<p>Okay, I'll try for specifics:  I would like a system with two resources.  One is earned (to start with) through "victories" and the other through "complications" ... using both in the sense of overcoming (or becoming entangled by) obstacles and challenges external to the social grouping of the characters.  Such challenges are fuel that players burn in order to generate these resources when they need them.</p>
<p>I would like there to be a sweet spot on both attributes, such that too little is too little, and too much is too much.</p>
<p>I would like the resources won through victory to be spent on things that link that player's character-actions to "awarding" resources to other characters.  So they can, through their actions, either help move somebody from "too little" into the sweet spot or they can move people from the sweet spot into "too much."</p>
<p>Likewise, I would like the resources won through complication to be spent on things that link the actions of characters other than the player's character to awarding resources to <em>their</em> character.  So they give other players the choice to, through their actions, either help them move from "too little" into the sweet spot or move from the sweet spot into "too much."</p>
<p>I would like a twinned negative feedback where having too much of one resource applies some limitation to spending the <em>other</em> resource ... so that people who have a lot of one resource are doubly encouraged to spend it, once because they've got so much and once because their other alternatives are constrained.</p>
<p>What I would like brainstorming on is what these resources should be (dice, +1s, rerolls, etc.) and what limitation the negative feedback should be.</p>
<p>Now, seriously ... if that's not enough information for anyone?  Give up.  Maybe I just plain don't know enough about the system to solicit help.  I've done the best I can to give you the information you need.</p>

                            I'm not going to answer directly, but show what I came up in my game with the help provided by your first post, as can be seen <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19504.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>So you're at too little Dots? You're too far from winning.<br/>You're at "Too many" Dots? Others will target you.<br/>Okay, that was constrained, I'm using a one-axis curve, but maybe you could port this idea to your two-axis need.<br/><br/>You have too little Dice? You can't affect change, you're at the mercy of other players, you're at risk of losing a whole semi-permanent Dot. If the other players do let you try to affect change, and you lose, or they help you lose, you're going down baby.<br/><br/>You have too many(as in, near the max of the pool)? If you'll win, not only will you lose all extra points, but you will give the other players more resources with which they can combat you.<br/><br/>judson brought up what I think is the important thing about "Sweet spots", they exist to stop stasis. If you have too little, you're motivated to get more, if you have too much you're motivated to use it up so as not to get penalized.<br/>Now, what about when you're at The Sweet Spot? What stops Stasis there?<br/>Either that your resources don't help you if you don't use them: So you're at the sweet spot, but you're really a non-player, others get penalized but they're getting what they want.<br/>Or that there's some mechanic that keeps moving you from balance: Either you get/lose X every turn, or there's some random inducing mechanic that moves you from balance, resulting in you having to keep trying to push for the middle constantly.<br/><br/>Hope this non-answer helped you <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Here's a mechanic.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say that you're rolling a pool of dice, and you want to roll high.<br/>
<br/>
What you do is you take a number of dice equal to your attribute and sum the five lowest dice.  Stats start at 1.  If you are rolling less than five dice, you just sum what you have.<br/>
<br/>
So, clearly, your value peaks at 5.  What I like about this is the decline afterwards is *slow*  I was thinking about tying it to a mechanic where, say, "After each conflict, you can raise the attribute you used or drop it back to 1."  Which clearly sucks either way.  Because 1 die is worse than any large number, but large numbers are continually worse.<br/>

<p><code>Now, what about when you're at The Sweet Spot? What stops Stasis there?</code></p>
<p>Lots of ways, yes.  One thing that I'm definitely investigating in Misery Bubblegum is that, when you've got a Sweet-spot mechanic, you can give players <strong>power</strong> over each other by giving them one-time rights to transfer resources from <em>themselves</em> to another player.</p>
<p>Like if I have too many Misery points, and someone else is in their sweet-spot, maybe I use the influence I got from learning their dark secret, and I dump three of my Misery points onto them.  Now I'm in my sweet spot, and they're over-loaded.</p>
<p>But on the good side, if they've got too few Misery points, and I've got too many, we can both hit our sweet spot by the same method.  She helps my character feel like life isn't too hard to face, and I remind her character that there are things in life you have to fight for ... together our apathy and despair average out to just the right amount of hopeful outrage.  Or something.</p>

<p>What kind of granularity are you looking for? I'm using this for a current project:</p>
<p>Roll 2-9 six-siders. Pairs are victories = good. Rolling a 6 is dirt = bad.</p>
<p>As you approach the ends, you have either little chance of a pair and a dirty 6 or great chance of pairs and the same of a 6. In the middle it can go either way. Of course this game allows you to kind of buy your way out of a dirty roll, but it costs you.</p>

<p>I am not looking for a sweet spot on an individual roll, or individual resolution.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is a system by which, over the course of many such resolutions, players have a flow of resources into and out of their hands ... and there is a sweet-spot in terms of how many resources they want to be carrying.</p>
<p>That way one simple mechanic (e.g. "Player receives 2 Misery dice") can be alternately helping to make the player more effective or less effective, depending on circumstances.</p>
