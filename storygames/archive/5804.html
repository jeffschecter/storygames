They are not so much interested in XP or accumulating wealth, what they want is to tell a good story and enjoy a night with some friends. ....these guys dig on the \u201crole\u201d part of roleplaying moreso than the \u201cgame.\u201d....  easier for them to leave the rules behind and end up referring to their character with the more intimate 'I.'"<br/><br/>"Goal-oriented gamers, aka \u201cBob\u201d roleplayers, usually avoid getting too far into their character\u2019s heads (for various reasons) and prefer to stay distanced ....For these players, the game is a game, and there are often very tangible goals that they hope to attain; defeat a dragon, amass considerable wealth, become a badass. These are the players that enjoy building their character over time and see them grow. Its not some much they seek to \u201cwin\u201d the roleplaying game, but that they do want to see development in their characters.... "<br/><br/>Now the first thing I can see is an attempt to type players and associate that with creative agenda. But I want to set aside discussion of pronoun use as tell for creative agenda preferences (game vs story vs immersion etc.) Or of the accuracy or value of such things as tells. (If you want to talk about that, please start a separate discussion  thread.)<br/><br/>Instead, I want to speculate on a couple of ideas.<br/><br/>First, when we describe our player actions in "I" mode, I suspect some players more often speak as "I the player" as opposed to "I the fiction character." I think this might indeed be a player-specific tendency that would say something about how the player thinks about the activity in general. Unfortunately, it's such a subjective distinction, I don't know how to gather data on that.<br/><br/>Another idea is that people swap between modes of speaking for reasons other than perspective on play in general. I recall distinctly many times when I've gone to "Bob" when describing actions that I either feel embarrassed about or worried that I might offend someone, or when I make a crude statement of motive or circumstance that seems appropriate at the moment.<br/><br/>Also, I think I tend to talk "I" when describing what my character does, but "Bob" when describing my character from Director Stance.<br/><br/>What can paying attention to "I" and "Bob" useages tells us during play? Is it a way of getting insight into how other players are engaging with the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130092/#Comment_130092" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T23:48:26+00:00" title="February 24, 2008 11:48PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2008 11:49PM by Ron Hammack.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to switch to third person when my real life emotional state differs greatly from my character's. Like, if I'm sitting at the table <i>laughing</i> because my character has just suffered an embarrassing misfortune, I'm not going to say "<i>I</i> tell everyone to go to hell and storm off in a huff!" I'm not sure if it's because I'm a lousy actor who wouldn't be able to convincingly switch from laughing with my friends to accurately portraying angry humiliation, or if I'm just <i>unwilling</i> to stop laughing with my friends long enough to act angry and humiliated; probably a little of both.<br/><br/>Other times I'll do it, like you said, to make a statement about my character's motive or circumstance. Again, some of that is due to my lack of acting skills (coupled with my lack of desire to <i>hone</i> my acting skills -- that's not why I game), but a lot of it is also for the benefit of my fellow players. If I just say "I refuse to help the Baron", the other players are stuck taking that at face value. If I say, "OK, Sir Bob refuses to help the Baron, because -- even though he'd never admit it -- he's afraid to fail, just like he did when he let his own liege die all those years ago", then the players know what's going on and can <i>decide</i> if their characters take that at face value or not.<br/><br/>Of course, another reason I switch from "I" to "Bob" is that I mostly GM, so I'm just in the <i>habit</i> of describing everything in third person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130093/#Comment_130093" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T00:45:16+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 12:45AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, sometimes I switch from first- to third-person just to break up the monotony.  Saying the same general things in more or less the same way for half an hour makes me look for a different way to present things.  I've said stuff in-game using the third person that, according to either Gunning's formula or your theory, I should've been saying in the first person.  And vice versa, naturally.<br/><br/>So, my answer to the question "Is it a way of getting insight into how other players are engaging with the game?" is that no, it isn't.

Accounting is right in that the correlation is not really strong enough to be diagnostic in most cases. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it is strong enough to be used as a proactive tool. That is, if you want to get more "immersive," then asking "What do you do?" is more conducive than asking "What does Bob do?" And if you want the player to be more authorial, asking about his character is more likely to do what you want than asking him as though he is the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is because we're trained in "unity" of POV. That is it's jarring to change POV in many cases. <br/>\n<br/>\nGM: "What is Bob doing?"<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "I'm going to the tavern." <br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like the wrong response. Certainly it's a viable response, and certainly you'll see it once in a while. But, generally people will respond in kind, at least until it's a good time to make one of Accounting's seques between POVs. Often this is between doing first person speech narration, and doing description of character action. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer: "Good day, Barkeep!" And, with that said, Bob exits the tavern. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the point being that if you want a player to think actor stance, or author stance, a way to make this more likely, is to use the POV that's more likely to cause that to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sure you can add: "Please respond as the character's author." <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's kinda wordy and unneccessary. Especially if you're not actually pushing that hard for a particular sort of response. It might even seem pushy. Often it's better to just be subtle and use the POV that you'd like to hear. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow as to why you might want to promote a particular stance? Well that's outside of this discussion. If you're not interested in ever doing that, then, no, there's not much use to this observation. But in practice I use it a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130267/#Comment_130267" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-25T12:08:59+00:00" title="February 25, 2008 12:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last time I consciously switched out of my usual 1st-person to third person is when I wanted to increase the pacing.

Like, "I flirt with the barmaid for a while, but just out of habit; I'm not really trying to get anywhere." In fact, that's my preferred method of portraying a character: summarizing their actions and speech and only getting into actual dialog when it's important to the story.

You can do this on purpose (useful if you need the player to operate on the player level for a bit "I think this scene is dragging, do you mind if I skip to the next scene?"), or you can do this accidentally (possibly disruptive to the experience the player is trying to generate for themselves).<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally, not everyone who is using "I" is character channeling, and not everyone who uses 3rd person isn't, but if a given individual is in the habit of using I when character channeling, switching from 1st to 3rd can signal or induce a break.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131439/#Comment_131439" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T16:58:48+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  4:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to confess...
