Also, I wrote a longer post, but when I tried to post it was eaten.  So I'm redoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should note that our player group has a wide range of experience.  1 person has played no roleplaying games ever, another has played werewolf twice, 2 have played werewolf many years ago, 1 played with me for about 6 months, and 3 others have played with me for approximately 3 years, spread out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal with Session 1 was to roleplay through First Change stories, go to a moot, and maybe pick a totem.  I ended up not doing much with the moot so that new players would have a chance to adjust.  Instead it was described as a whirlwind of sound, color, and smells, and I'll go into it more after the first month of in game time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat went well:<br/>\n<br/>\nLupus First Changes:  I thought the lupus(wolf-born) players did a great job of varying their First Changes.  I was worried that they would all feel the same, and they didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nStoryteller calling Rage:  I know this is opposing what Sean said, I didn't know if I should comment or put it here.  I thought this went well.  Part of the game mechanic is that the Storyteller calls for the player to make a 'Rage roll'  When something frustrating enough happens.  If the player does too well, then they fly into a frenzy.  The idea is that if you have too much Rage(which is very helpful elsewhere), you might snap at provocation.  I was using the same internal judgments, for the most part, that I'll be using in game to call Rage.  See below for when I didn't use internal judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\ngoogle groups:  We made a google group and it's working great for keeping track of everything, and for having an easily accessible place to store things like city data, pack data, and commentary on playing the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could have gone better:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer descriptions of scene flow.  The players did a great job of setting the scene, but not so hot on describing how they wanted the scene to go. While in some scenes it was easy to figure it out and really improv off each other, in other scenes it was harder.  This left some scenes dragging, with the player not QUITE getting enough frustration/anger for me to call Rage early, and eventually I called them because the scene wasn't building.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was difficult:<br/>\n<br/>\nChallenges.  I saw an issue there, and have already started working on it.  The big challenge will be to get players to declare challenge on another player without storyteller intervention.  I don't normally intervene in these matters, since in the past that has resulted in accidental challenges that people didn't want.  So I stay back to let players do it.  However, I needed to be clearer about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this was somewhat fascinating.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171498/#Comment_171498" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T11:40:34+00:00" title="September 26, 2008 11:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was.

They are all bluster but don't want to be faced with the possibility that their desire may come down to a die roll that they might loose.  I think it's an ego thing.  Nobody wants to look like a fool, especially at the expense of the other players (I\u2019m intentionally using players here instead of characters; I think it is a very meta issue).  <br/><br/>Some games, like Burning Wheel or Dogs in the Vineyard facilitate this by forcing arguments to be resolved with dice.  When two characters disagree they each have two choices: back down or roll dice.  There is basically no opportunity for the players to cow each other through role-playing.  Yes, role-playing still happens, and sometimes someone makes such a convincing argument that the other side gives, but in general, how long you can stay in the fight, who wins and what compromises the winner makes all comes down to the dice.  Personally, in a game like Werewolf where you are likely to have a lot of players playing very stubborn characters, I think instigating a mechanic like this is critical.  <br/><br/>Important to getting player buy in though is that the players have to know that they won't get too boned if they loose.  The stakes are what is at hand, not their honor, or place in the pack.  You've already said that there is no loss of honor for loosing and honorably challenge, but I think that needs to be clarified, repeated, and shown by example (i.e. some NPC should probably challenge us right off the bat for something).  <br/><br/>Sadly, Werewolf lacks a strong conflict resolution system outside of combat, and the characters need ways of challenging each other on even (or close to even) ground.  Combat is all juicy and fiddly, but the rest of the game isn't. So stare down contests just feel like intimidation rolls, not the excitement of combat. Not your fault, not even white wolf's fault, WtA is very much a product of it's time.<br/><br/>Another thing to bring up is that challenges don\u2019t have to be huge ordeals.  There are little, silent challenges that are made all the time.  Two werewolves both come to a door, one of them will go before the other.  The big one growls and the little one steps back to let him through, or the little one chuckles and darts in before the big guy can catch him.  There is not huge consequence, but it is a challenge and I do think it should be resolved as such.  Make some rolls, the winner goes first and gets a point of glory.  There is incentive to make challenges (renown awards) and they don\u2019t have to be big deals.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t think this will happen, but it is possible that the players might become munchkins and start making challenges as glory generators.  That is easy to fix, once they start acting like tards someone says \u201cYou know, that isn\u2019t honorable\u201d.  The next time they instigate a lame challenge to just harvest glory they loose honor or wisdom. <br/><br/>From the player\u2019s perspective, I\u2019m all down with players initiating challenges, and I will try to lead by example if I can.  Sadly, Francois has a really bad temper and he\u2019s likely to be something of a trouble maker at first, however, once he gets beat up some, he\u2019ll back down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171574/#Comment_171574" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T15:17:26+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  3:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, challenges have always been the hardest part for me as storyteller, and for players, at the beginning of the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour last sentence says it all!  Once the initial part is done, the rest is much, much easier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are rewards and what not in the course of a normal game.  I didn't do any rewards, including xp, cause I totally forgot (the perils of going diceless, heh).  Players should pretty quickly figure out the benefits of rolling dice and the perils of not rolling dice.  (Most NPCs won't back down aside from a roll.  do you think that should be mentioned, or learned?  I tend towards learned, but I also end up figuring that everyone should know it about my games already.  *shrug*)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171582/#Comment_171582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T15:54:55+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  3:54PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mentioned, learned, and re-iterated.  It never ceases to amaze me how many players (again including me) find themselves at a loss for how to move things forward. Early on I think you should say that when you want someone who disagrees with you to back down you need to either convince them to in a single attempt or roll dice to accomplish it.  Thus if the player says I want the bouncer to let me in the club and I offer in $100, as a GM you can easily say "sure, he takes it and tells you to stay out of trouble."  But if the player offers him $5 and you say nope, he's not taking it, the player can then either roll dice or give up, he can't continue to berate the bouncer (I mean, he can, but he'll do that by making a persuasion or intimidation or melee roll or whatever).  In fact, thinking on it, I think the player should just roll a Stat + Resources roll, and if he makes it he pays off the bouncer without impact on his cash flow, if he fails it either hurts his pocket book, the bouncer is upset by the bribe, he\u2019s caught by the manager who wants to have words, etc. <br/><br/>Then in game, I'd bring it up, often.  "The elder tells you to fall in line, he grows a predatory growl, and I rolled 4 successes on intimidation, roll to stand up to him or fall in line... The robber busts out the window and runs off, roll athletics to follow him or give up the chase... The other pack wants you off their territory, but they are willing to negotiate... roll em!"<br/><br/>I say, just make challenges quick and steer them away from stakes that cause the destruction or humiliation of a character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven" title="buffaloraven"><img alt="buffaloraven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buffaloraven">buffaloraven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171583/#Comment_171583" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T16:00:17+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  4:00PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that makes sense.
