I was running through a corridor. Suddenly, I opened a door in her face trying to stop at least the syringe (by sticking it into the door). It worked, and I escaped the ghost.<br/>But, according to the manual, Francesca should have said "I don't think it will help. You block the syringe with the door, but the ghost passes through the wood, and chokes you to death" or "In my opinion, the ghost is quicker than you, and easily avoid the door, drives the syringe in your right eyes and pushes it into your brain. You're dead."<br/>The only discriminating factors seemed to be her judgement, and her idea of realism (but how the hell it is possible to determine when the deeds of a ghost are <i>realistic</i>?).<br/>Another suggestion for the MC was to do something "if it scares you". Damn, she could have said "dying in a horrible way <i>is</i> scary! you're dead and gone, no way!"<br/><br/>I'm sure that we missed something or we played wrong.<br/>I cannot believe that the MC can perform an action or a "move" that allows him to instantly kill the other player "because he says so".<br/>That's not scary, that's deeply frustrating.<br/>Can anyone help us?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369792/#Comment_369792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T15:19:40+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  3:19PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I playtested the game, and I also found it lacking in anything resembling fun as I know it, but YMMV, as others have enjoyed it (or so they claim).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369797/#Comment_369797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T15:28:54+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  3:28PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I'm sure that we missed something or we played wrong.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I don't get it.

And if it happens, I think I will perceive it as "not funny at all", and I'm talking "out game" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>It sounds so strange I thought we misinterpreted the rules.<br/><i>Edit: apart from this queston, we enjoyed the game.

I need to know both to play properly, both to avoid unpleasant discussions during next games, not between me and my wife (we work with games and players, it's really hard to see us squabbling while gaming) but, for example if we show the game to someone else in some event, or fair, or gaming night.<br/>If I play the game the correct rules and I don't like it, is anyway fine to me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369930/#Comment_369930" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T05:23:18+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  5:23AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

When I, as the other player, must say "something I wanted to do before dying" or some information like that (I remember I had to say who was the most important person for my education or something like that), I must say something <i>personal</i>, or I should say something to "build" the character? For example, in the last game, I just said "my father" to the second question: next time, should I say something more, like <i>"my father, that was always late from work</i>" or something fictional, like <i>"my father, which died leaving me alone... I dream him every night!"</i>.<br/><br/>2. can we try some day to change the age of the protagonist (if he still is "a man with a good health") and the location (if it's still "a closed, mazy, claustrophobic, place filled with ghost, with the exit far away - but not so far away" and so on), or it will anyway disrupt gameplay (or psycology behind the rules)? Not a great question, I know, but also other italian players asked for that. I think it's just a matter of "changing a bit of color" when you play again with the same player, changing the factory with, well, an asylum or an old library or whatever could be fun.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your answers... I will try it again this evening, this time I'm going to be the MC.
