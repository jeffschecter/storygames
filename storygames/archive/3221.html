It's been suggested that I use a system entirely without numbers. Not just words-replacing-numbers, as in Fudge, or even numbers-assigned-to-words, as in The Pool, but <i>no numbers at all</i>. I am intrigued by the notion, but not convinced it's right for Do.<br/><br/>Dread's Jenga mechanic is certainly intriguing. You could also probably create a comparison resolution system like rock-paper-scissors. Non-dice-based games are another way to do it as well.<br/><br/>I'd like your thoughts and experiences with no-math games, especially those which have no numbers. Are numbers totally unavoidable? What are some good alternatives to number-based systems?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73338/#Comment_73338" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T09:15:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  9:15AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2007 9:16AM by Matthijs.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That depends what your system is <i>for</i>. <br/><br/>If you want resource handling, then it's hard to do without numbers. You could have players manipulate stacks of tokens, for example, instead of numbers on sheets; that's probably only halfway what you meant, though.<br/><br/>If you just want a resolution system, any resolution system, there's an infinity of ways to do that without numbers. <br/>- Toss a coin. <br/>- See who can hold their breath the longest. <br/>- (This one's actually cool:) Give players either red, blue or green flags. If you're in a conflict, people with different colored flags will settle it. That is, if a red and a blue are in conflict, the greens come up with the result. If two reds are in conflict, the blues come up with a positive outcome, the greens with a negative, and they toss a coin.<br/>- Have certain magic events in a game. Whoever has introduced the most of those events since the last conflict gets to settle this one. Events can be: A character suffers serious damage; an NPC becomes a traitor; a player sings a song in character.<br/><br/>[EDIT] You might want to check out <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=13952.0" rel="nofollow">"A trip to the moon"</a>, a no-math game I made a while ago.

In a board game a Cave Man could have a combat factor of 12. Combat would be resolved using a combat results table. The Star Ship Enterprise might also have a combat factor of 12 and resolve fights on a near identical CRT. I know the scales are different but it really made me see how limited number systems could be. You just couldn't put two games together and have them make any sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still think words are a better way of transmitting information than numbers (though I appreciate numbers when I'm doing my accounting!) When a player makes a Matrix Game argument and invents a clue (as they do in murder mystries and horror games) each clue adds to the matrix of the world and sometimes changes it completely. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still use some number though. If you use dice in a game numbers are hard to avoid. In Engle Matrix Games they are part of the "to happen" roll. Does an argument happen on a roll of 2-6 or 5-6? Once the turn is resolved though the numbers are dropped which means we use numbers rather than get used by numbers. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow are you planning on evading mathematical algorithyms? I do it by viewing the results of arguments as adding to the matrix of the world. The matrix affects the referee/GM's judgment about the strength of future arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle<br/>\nHamster Press = Engle Matrix Games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73534/#Comment_73534" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T06:57:10+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  6:57AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn...

The character stats are completely narrative, there's a little bit of counting in chargen (you get N of these traits, M of those, that sort of thing), but there is a dice system.<br/><br/>OTOH, the dice system isn't tied to the character traits, really, but is it's own set of numbers (admittedly character-associated, rather than player-associated or the same for everyone). And rolling the dice only requires comparing and ordering, no more-complex math--and no interaction with the character traits.<br/><br/>However, the dice thing is basically the "tie breaker" mechanic, and a very similar game could be had without it, albeit probably with a bit more fiat (not necessarily GM fiat, however).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73790/#Comment_73790" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T10:44:23+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 10:44AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>You could also probably create a comparison resolution system like rock-paper-scissors.

For instance, if you have a system where you have a rainbow of colors, where the ones closer to violet beat the ones closest to red, well, that's math. What's interesting to us (well, me at least) is that often the steps involved are no more complex using math than they are as indicated. The FUDGE scale is a precise example of this, but so is the color wheel example. You have to look at the two data being presented, and do a comparison on a scale. That has precisely the same mnemonic requirements and steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly you could have too much math in your game, but then again you could also have too many of any sort of step. I could counter your notion that math is often problematic with a claim that it's about kneejerk reactions to bad experiences with math. Whereas I like numbers, so maybe that's my bias.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point being that math or no math can't be part of the equation of elegance. It's all about the number of operations involved. Outside of that, math just becomes a question of aesthetic choice. At which point it really comes down to preferences. I prefer math in my games, because I like not having to learn another replacement system, and the complexity that math can deliver. Hence why, when playing FUDGE, I throw out the ladder, and just use numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also no hard and fast line for what is or is not math as a step. If any logic is being used, one could argue that it comes down to mathematics of some sort. So you can really only say what Daniel says above, which sorts of operations you don't want to see (like arithmetic ones, but maybe not comparisons).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that "mathless" design is great in that it probably will lead to new notions on how to design in the end, shaking things up. But I don't think you can put a value judgement on it. Yes, it's more than possible by these specific definitions. But it's just one road one can take in design.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73827/#Comment_73827" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T12:12:07+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 12:12PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hence why, when playing FUDGE, I throw out the ladder, and just use numbers.</blockquote>\nI'm totally the opposite. I find enormous value in saying, "I'm a Great swordsman," or "It will take some Good piloting to get through this storm." The comparison itself might be the same mental process as comparing two numbers, but for me, the use of words makes everything more natural and smooth in play.<br><br>Just, you know, to offer a different viewpoint.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73833/#Comment_73833" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T12:24:55+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 12:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, it's also the Road Less Traveled right now, which I think, from a diversity standpoint, makes it a better road for the time being, as with all other less-traveled roads.<br><br>Also, what John said.

For example in AD&amp;D (or D&amp;D) does the value of "level" mean anything? You don't use it in any equations. You don't count with it. (Except when undead are sucking your levels, but I think that came later than the level thing, so you can play without it.) You have an instruction, that "you should raise your thac0 by 2 when gaining a level" or something like that, but gaining a level depends on exp and has nothing to do with the number of levels, it's just a help to show you how many times your character gained a level.<br><br>So I think that you can use numbers without math and you can leave out numbers still using math. But if you are making a "game", wich means there are discrete states and/or possibilities and/or laid down choices, it comes back right to math, and maybe you don't have to use arithmetics while playing, you have to use advanced mathematics for designing such a game or maybe even to optimalize playing.<br><br>But to be constructive:<br><br>I think you could call a no math game where there are no laid down rules for what is better than what or what makes what, rather use somekind of intuition for it.

Using subjective rightness and wrongness as a source of game mechanics rather than objective superiority or inferiority. Your morality <i>is</i> the source of your stats. If you have "Fightin' 2" and "Thinkin' 0" that doesn't mean you're better at fighting than thinking, it simply means that you think it is <i>more right to fight</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73914/#Comment_73914" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T07:19:54+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  7:19AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: algiBut I think there is no math in the strict sense if you say "angry" or "happy" or "calm", because happiness can anger you or calm you down, it isn't laid down, it depends on the "situation" so to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the kind of information I mean when I talk about the "Matrix" of Engle Matrix Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay a player makes an argument that his men become angry about new taxes. This argument goes through. He has added anger to the matrix of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother player comes along and says that the king goes infront of the people and they cheer him and give him money. WAIT JUST A MINUTE! The people are angry. That has to count for something in the likelyhood of this new argument happening. It feels wrong - your rightness/wrongness evaluation. This evaluation will change each time a new bit of information comes into the matrix. Say for instance the king comes in with his new wife Lady Dianna. Everyone loves her. BOOM! They may well cheer and throw money.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor subtle information like this to affect the game mechanics there has to be a way for it to be considered in the chance to happen of each step of the game. Trying to do this mathematically is unworkable - but doing it poetically - judging each event as it comes using your reason and gut - that is pretty darned easy. I have nearly twenty years of play testing that kind of approach to back that claim up.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73915/#Comment_73915" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T07:33:40+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  7:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johns,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're not disagreeing on anything, are we?
