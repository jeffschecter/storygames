There's a lot of expectations placed on the players, and I was a little concerned that I had not provided enough guts to keep it from being an exercise in parlor narration. It's a fine line but I feel better after playing - the questions, and answering them, build situation and make later choices matter more than they would otherwise. We had a good time endowing newly-introduced characters with relationships (the Cop is the aunt of the Teen; the Driver and the Earth Child have a history; the Plutocrat is the Earth Mother's dad) which was important and amusing. For something you can play to completion in less than two hours, it feels well-paced and just light enough.<br/><br/>When disaster finally struck, it was some kind of toxic cloud that was rolling down the slopes - right into the valley hosting the Cub Scout jamboree! The only fatality was the headstrong, cool-as-ice Driver, who went back up into the cloud to rescue his buddy Jody, a Galaga-obsessed teenager. <br/><br/>I learned a lot! There are some issues with NPC allocation, which can get squirrelly if the disaster doesn't come early enough, and not enough people died, and portions of the endgame felt slightly off, but all in all I'm really happy with Danger Mountain! <br/><br/>I recorded the whole session - you can listen to us play if that's your thing, <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/game_chef/danger_mountain_playtest_01.mp3" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/game_chef/danger_mountain_playtest_02.mp3" rel="nofollow">here</a> (two large .mp3 files)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
