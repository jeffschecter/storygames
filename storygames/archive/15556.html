As we prefer transparency to keeping secrets, there is generally no need to whisper -- rather let other players notice that you are using the technique and more importantly, let them listen in on what you are saying.<br/><br/>The key thing about the bird-in-ear technique is to give all input as thoughts of the character in first-person or monologue. You might say that the game master takes over the character for a short while, but does not perform any direct actions. Bird-in-ear is preferable to direct instructions, not only because this is usually disliked and against the idea of collaborative storytelling, but also because first-person thought etc. can easily be interpreted to fit the player's own perception of the character, which is a good thing for the obvious reasons.<br/><br/>Example: Four persons are sitting in a car. No-one knows the any of the others. Rolf, in the back seat, is taking a liking to Ulrika in the front seat, on the passenger side. Rolf's player does not know this yet, though.<br/><br/>To telegraph this to Rolf's player, the game master will stand beside him and give a short voice over, in the form of an inner monologue: "That girl looks really nice. I loved the way she introduced herself before. Looking straight into the eyes. I like that. What was her name again? Damn!"<br/><br/>This gives Rolf a nice vector to play to. Naturally, the game masters tone of voice etc. are additional tools here. If the game master's inner monologue is stuttering, insecure, then that will be adopted by Rolf's player most likely. As Ulrika's player will also hear this, she will be better equiped to interact with Rolf.<br/><br/>Bird-in-ear can also be used to give information to many players:<br/><br/>Four persons are walking through a dark forest. Suddenly, the game master cries out: "What was that?!"<br/><br/>Key thing again is giving input that is not outside the game. It is clear that this is probably a reaction from one of the players. However, it is not clear who hears this sound, or sees something, etc. The "functional information" is there to be (mis)interpreted which is a good thing. The player best equipped to be scared etc. here is likely to pick it up. Let the player's decide themselves -- your mission as game master is generally just to cue the event, not to go into the details of playing it out.</blockquote>\nNeat!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352612/#Comment_352612" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T08:48:40+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  8:48AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2011 8:49AM by Emily_Care.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to make sure there's not confusion--semi-live just means that you can stand up and play out stuff if you feel like it.

The techniques I listed are just a grab bag of things that seemed appropriate to the style of play. There are tons more that would fit too!<br/><br/>Internal Monologue:<br/>From jeepen.org, <a href="http://jeepen.org/dict/#monologue" rel="nofollow">Monologue</a>:\n<blockquote>Technique for showing the inner thoughts of a character. A player may hold a monologue, which is from the character's perspective, but not something that actually takes place in the game's reality. Sometimes, the monologue can be a backdrop to the game, sometimes, all other activities pause and everyone listens closely to the monologue.</blockquote>\nEndowment (players gift each other's characters with problems/aspects):\n<blockquote>In order for an improvised scene to be successful, the actors involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an actor makes an offer, meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using mime to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as endowment. It is the responsibility of the other actors to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, which usually prevents the scene from developing.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://method.vtheatre.net/improv.html" rel="nofollow">http://method.vtheatre.net/improv.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote>GM-like responsibilities (1-many play for some players)<br/>Sides/teams/good-bad dichotomy<br/>Dedicated roles, if desired (ie 1-1 play for some players)<br/>Goals/victory<br/>Consequences: harm, loss, death</blockquote>\nHere I'm describing (mostly) traditional role play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352614/#Comment_352614" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T08:51:17+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  8:51AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bird-in-Ear is awesome and has a lot of potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352621/#Comment_352621" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T09:30:24+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  9:30AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Bird-in-Ear is awesome and has a lot of potential.</blockquote> <i>A Penny for my Thoughts</i> implements it with a really interesting kink - a couple of birds are whispering in your ear, and only one is right.

But by addressing the character who's "feeling that", it feels... actually fun, to me. Less restrictive, somehow.<br/><br/>In my old D&amp;D groups (or paladium or whatever), the GM/DM would say, yeah, you notice this or that, or you feel this or that... but since, y'know, the "story" was "about" what the GM/DM had made up (or were making up on the spot) &amp; the fun to be had was exploring that material. There wasn't a "We are going to explore the emotional connections and disconnections between our characters" component. <br/><br/>That's why i'm excited about bird-in-ear, it's relatively new to me, and still feels really fresh.
