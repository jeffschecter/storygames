Jason and Doug couldn't make the game but the rest of us really want to play. So I threw some things at the guys and just sat back and watched. As a result, we got to explore some rules we don't use often including those for Social Combat and Chases. We hope you have as much fun listening as we did playing.<br/><br/><a href="http://media.podcastingmanager.com/2/0/6/6/8/295141-286602/Media/rsg094_DN05.mp3" rel="nofollow">Download Here!</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
