For example, I can run Dogs in the Vineyard all day long.  But both In a Wicked Age and Poison'd, which have a GM with a somewhat non-traditional role, have proven very difficult for me, even though much looser GM-less games are typically no problem. </blockquote>\nThis struck me immediately, as In a Wicked Age is the only rpg of Vincent's that I can run at a drop of a hat, but Poison'd and Dogs leave me shaking in my boots. I might be able to pull off Dogs, but I'm fairly perplexed as to HOW I would run Poison'd. This isn't to say that I don't understand the game or rules, but just the GMing of it.<br/><br/>In this spirit, I'm very curious as to what games just hit that sweet spot for you as a GM and why; what games just <i>feel right.</i> If there isn't anything that does this for you, what kind of elements in a rpg would make you more comfortable as a GM?<br/><br/>If you feel like being silly on this thread, tell us about a game that makes you uncomfortable as a GM.<br/><br/>I'm not really concerned with GM-less games here.<br/><br/>For me: In a Wicked Age, Mouse Guard, and Don't Rest Your Head are reliably comfortable games for me to run even when I don't recall the rules completely. I GET how the game is supposed to be (in my head anyway) and that lends me the confidence to run them even while making mistakes. Also, the lack of much prep that I can get away with ad-libbing anyways is key to my enjoyment and relaxation while playing.<br/><br/>What makes me uncomfortable running is Call of Cthulhu, and to a lesser extent, the Gumshoe stuff. I desperately love the genres and styles of these games, but I'm dumbfounded and stressed when I need to plan out a mystery, the order of events, clues, and npcs. And actually running the thing with all this stuff? Forget about it. This is probably why these games are at the top of my list of ones that I would love to play, but not run.<br/><br/>You?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246884/#Comment_246884" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T13:13:11+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  1:13PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I GM a game, I need a few things.

I know what my job is as GM, and yet I also can push a bit with ("indie") techniques to make my job easier. I can always find a Flag, start with a Bang, keep theme (or goal) in site, and (usually) hold my own portraying more than a few NPCs.<br/><br/>IAWA still binds me up a bit, but mainly when it comes to teaching how to play (don't set stakes, no "talking conflicts," the mechanics are ex-narrative) and to managing multi-party conflicts. I've never tried it, but I'm sure I'd be flailing about a bit with Burning Empires until I got all the mechanics down ("down" as in "understand why they work the way they do," not "memorized as rote activities").<br/><br/>I guess I haven't really had an "uncomfortable" time with GMing in a long time, certainly not in the past couple of decades. MAYBE way back in the day, I could get a bit of stage fright, but that's was "game agnostic," even though most/all games we played back then were "trad" (hmmm, but I DO recall not wanting to be the go-to guy for Chill, but I think that's because another friend of ours was MUCH better at horror GMing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246892/#Comment_246892" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-15T13:19:43+00:00" title="December 15, 2009  1:19PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>When I GM a game, I need a few things.

And the rest of the book is this lovely, insane, jumbled mess of psycho plot hooks that I absolutely adore but have <i>no idea</i> how to successfully use in play.<br/><br/>Oh, and Jonathan Tweet's writing style for the game - very reminiscent of the personal and critical tone used by Ron Edwards in Sorcerer - makes me feel like I'm the butt of some practical joke.
