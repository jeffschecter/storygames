                    I went to the FLGS tonight to buy some dice, and took a moment to page through all the shiny new D&amp;D stuff.  Now, I have played D&amp;D only once, long ago, and my reading tonight was cursory, but it looked a whole lot like the only way to score XP was to overcome a monster in an encounter.  Surely I read this wrong?  Can you get XP for political savvy, for social graces, for raising an army, for building a mechanical wonder, for... I don't know, anything that isn't killing monsters and taking their stuff?<br/><br/>Kindly illuminate me, story-games.                </div>

                            Joshua, it's all about how the DM sets things up.<br/><br/>You score XP for overcoming obstacles.  An obstacle can be  an encounter with a monster, but it can also be a trap, or a situation requiring political, technological, or social savvy.  The CR (challenge rating) for combat encounters is strictly defined, as are those for traps, but for others the CR is loosely defined.                        </div>

                            Suppose there's a MacGuffin.  There's an Ogre in the way.  You get the xp for the Ogre for doing ANY of the following:<br/>
<br/>
Killing it and taking its stuff.<br/>
Sneaking by it and getting the MacGuffin.<br/>
Cutting a deal with it for the MacGuffin.<br/>
Tricking it into getting out of your way.<br/>
Tricking the dragon into eating the ogre, thereby freeing up the path to the MacGuffin.<br/>
Etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
You probably don't get xp just for sneaking by random dudes, cutting random deals, doing random tricks, or watching random dragons eat random encounters.  There has to be some sort of "challenge."                        </div>

Um, sure you do, unless his CR is so far beneath yours that he's not worth any XP.<br/><br/>Joshua, anything beyond defeating a monster/NPC or or encountering a trap is square in the realm of "roleplaying awards." The amount of that reward is pretty much in the realm of DM fiat, though there are guidelines in the DMG. There is no "CR" for, say, a political debate.<br/><br/>And I'd also argue with some of Willow's points, but I don't have my DMG in front of me. In general, you don't earn XP just for acquiring the Maguffin. The Maguffin has no impact on calculating XP. You get XP for defeating the ogre, and what counts as "defeating" is defined in the DMG.<br/><br/>Overcoming/defeating monsters and traps is the primary way you earn XP in D&amp;D. This is why it's okay that your attack bonus, hit points, and saves are tied to level advancement, as you advance by fighting stuff and getting into dangerous situations, i.e., a fitting reward cycle.                        </div>

                            Man, I never thought I'd get into a D&amp;D rules discussion on Story Games... and lose! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Vax, the orc, if a plain ol' MM-standard orc, is worth 150XP. Not much of a challenge for a party, but maybe for a one-on-one with a 1st-level PC. It's within the DM's purview to not award the XP if he feels the encounter was simply too darn easy, but that it was Joe Bystander orc doesn't really matter. They're evil! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>As for the examples Willow gave, they're subject to DM fiat. W/r/t sneaking past minotaurs: "It's up to you to make such judgements" (p.37).<br/><br/>However, beyond monsters and traps, you're really in fiat land.<br/><br/>"These are called story awards, and should only be used by an experienced DM" (p.40). And later: "The PCs should have to do something impressive to get [a story award]", "The [mission goal] XP award is entirely up to you." On p. 41: "XP awards for roleplaying are purely ad hoc" and you're advised they should never be more than 50XP x level. "Don't simply add story awards to standard awards... unless you want to speed up character progression." I.e., you're advised not to mix the two.<br/><br/>"Good roleplaying" may be able to net my 10th level PC up to 500XP if the DM is even using RP awards, but facing a CR10 monster will get me a solid 750XP (in a four-PC party).<br/><br/>All I'm saying, once you move beyond monsters and traps, you're in territory even the DMG itself considers "nonstandard." The 100% sure way to earn XP is to battle something or fall into a spiked pit.                        </div>

Yeah! I ran it for a Gameday (as well as a playtest). It fires on all cylinders: clear goal w/o feeling railroaded, exciting combats, PCs who get to show off badass-itude yet still be challenged, adn a righteous big-bad. The whole "tokens encouraging players to act in their class's idiom" worked like a charm, too.<br/><br/>Someone at a subsequent Gameday ran <em>White Plume Mountain</em> with IH, and it rawked.                        </div>

<i>The 100% sure way to earn XP is to battle something or fall into a spiked pit.</i><br/><br/>I just wanted to pull this out and smile beatifically.  It's true--you earn XP just for surviving a trap, but not for just surviving a monster.  That you have to defeat.  Of course, in D&amp;D language, surviving the fall is defeating the trap.  It works, but talk about funny sounding.  I keep imagining some fighter limping around with a spear through his leg mumbling "I showed that trap what's for!"                        </div>

                            Perhaps "Say yes or roll the dice" applies here. If there's no potential for XP, then the GM should announce that it is so. If killing a random orc isn't important to the game, just freeform it. But if significant XP is at stake, then invoke the system. Tell them "Hey, you can earn 150 XP if you outwit this orc in some fashion." Now, they see the challenge as more than just killing a mook, and they might look for alternate solutions.                        </div>

                            John, yes, this is precisely the problem with saying that D&amp;D can reward anything. Sure it can, in the same way that cars can fly if you put wings on them. That is, any system that says, "The GM can determine a reward for whatever he wants" and then doesn't give him any tools for this particularly, is trying to pull a fast one. <br/><br/>I mean the GM can just say that circumventing the army is worth 1000 points arbitrarily. But how does he come up with that? When the only thing he's got is the CR's saying that they're worth 15,000? He wings it, that's how. And then everyone feels that there's no real system in use, that it's "cheating" or something. <br/><br/>D&amp;D is designed to reward combat, and that's what it does well. You can also use it for other things, but it's not as good for anything else. So, no surprise, that's how most people play it. With a small subset who simply drift the game so that EXP aren't really important. (In Rolemaster I used to just tell everyone to level up after a couple of adventures rather than calculate the spreadsheets for EXP). <br/><br/>So when people say that D&amp;D is about Killing Things and Taking Stuff, it's quite accurate. And that's just on the "what do we reward for?" side. On the reward side, what do you get? A level, right? What's the one thing that everyone gets with a level? Hit Points? Which are for? Combat (and surviving traps). So the output side is about combat too. <br/><br/>This is an intentional feature of D&amp;D, not a bug. If you don't like it, play something else. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Actually, you'd probably just give them the XP for whoever they actually persuaded -- probably the army's commander.

                            When 3.0 came out, the idea of challenges as abstract units that must be overcome got talked up a lot, with some interesting ideas that were essentially about scene framing as, in D&amp;D reward terms, a scene ("Encounter") is very nearly defined by its potential reward.  It was clear, from discussion, that the game _could_ support more flexible challenges, but the complexities of doing so in practice led to some painful discussions (*cough* ECL *Cough*) and a lot of the core principals falling by the wayside.<br/><br/>Now, -that- said, the restructuring of XP in 3.0+ allowed for the creation of a "Standard Award" which was equal to the amount of Xp a party would get for overcoming a challenge of their level.  A number of products (All third party to my knowledge, though I'm not sufficiently up on the WOTC releases to say that with authority) hit upon this as sort of a standardized currency by which they could reward _other_ behaviors. Rather than just arbitrarily say "Sneaking around the army is worth 1000xp" designers could say that "Finding a peaceful resolution to this problem is worth a standard reward."<br/><br/>My absolute favorite use of this approach was in Chris Aylott's magnificent Dynasties &amp; Demagogues, which effectively introduced roleplaying feats, which granted some manner of fortune point, which could be turned in for a standard award *for the group*.  Wonderful example of where the system can go.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll weigh in agreeing that you will get much more support from a purely combat &amp; trap driven XP system in D&amp;D, but I think that there is some support of other approaches, and while none of it has the pure mass of C&amp;T XP, it does have options that are better structured than pure arbitrariness.  <br/><br/>Personally, I tend not to use XP at all, but I recognize that if nothing else, that means I need to figure out some extra rules to let artificers be cool. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            This is why the Forgotten Realms has a chain store called X.P. Fantabulo's U-Kill Kobold Ranch. Each 'ranch' is a big stockyard with an attached abattoir. The customer selects how many kobolds he needs to kill to make the next level and the 'ranch hands' round up the little doggies, and set them all in a row, under a long guillotine blade in the abattoir. When they're in position, the customer is shown to a big, shiny button. They press it, the blade comes down and the experience points come rolling in. <br/><br/>I play in what I think are two very typical DnD games. Combat is considered the main course and everything else leading up to it, just so much salad. The DMs are usually apologetic if we didn't get to combat during a given session. The DMs will still hand out some lesser exp rewards if we don't engage in combat, sticking instead to problem-solving, planning, etc...                        </div>

                            There's a classic Dragon cartoon to much that effect, with a box contianing a minotaur labeled "For 183xp, inser sword here".  Boiling Ants is another such classic.<br/><br/>Really, CR was _supposed_ to be the solution to this sort of silliness.  A monster had a given Challenge rating, for a fair fight, and based on numbers, environment an domplications, those monsters would all combine to form an effective encounter level, which determined how much XP you would get based upon how challenging it was.  This could be a genre enforcement tool - getting past a gate was a CR2 encounter, since it required a bribe or a decent diplomacy check, and if the players decided to fight, something that would bring in a whole city guard worth of opposition, winning would still only award at CR2, because they had chosen to do it the hard way.<br/><br/>When someone, and I think it was Monte Cook, framed it that way, I was intrigued and excited.  <br/><br/>Now, as noted, this sort of thinking has fallen by the wayside, much the same way that any kind of focused thinking on the purposes of Prestige classes did,  However, i think it's still alive in sneaky ways.<br/><br/>Mike Mearls runs a weekly game over  lunch up at WOTC, and if you hear peopel give secondhand accounts, they describe it as him running a fight, and that that's pretty cool.  Thing is, if you hear Mearls describe it, there's a subtle difference:  he sets up a _situation_.  There's a fight, or even a sequence of fights certainly, but it's a dynamic set of events within a closed stage.  That is fantastic, laser-focused use of D&amp;D's strengths in a way that illustrate more depth than even a lot of its fans give it credit for.  Now, Mearls is a grand master black belt in D&amp;D, so maybe this sort of thinking will never spread, but if it does just consider what happens when D&amp;D is a tool for _situation_ and the tools for reward _reinforce_ that.  The doors get blown off, and a lot of what was promising in 3.0 cones streaming back to the forefront.<br/><br/>Maybe it's a crazy dream, but it's one I'm on the lookout for.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

And the very next time I talk about D&amp;D I'll say, "Well, it's good to kill dragons with." <br/><br/>I AM DUMBOR.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Now, -that- said, the restructuring of XP in 3.0+ allowed for the creation of a "Standard Award" which was equal to the amount of Xp a party would get for overcoming a challenge of their level.  A number of products (All third party to my knowledge, though I'm not sufficiently up on the WOTC releases to say that with authority) hit upon this as sort of a standardized currency by which they could reward _other_ behaviors. Rather than just arbitrarily say "Sneaking around the army is worth 1000xp" designers could say that "Finding a peaceful resolution to this problem is worth a standard reward."</blockquote>
So the advantage of the standard award is that it scales with level, right?  i.e. A standard award would be appropriate for a challenge where it doesn't matter how skilled you are, like solving a riddle.  But it's less appropriate for something which gets easier, say, with a high Diplomacy skill.  It sounds like a workable variant on the official Story Award, but I don't see how it is any less arbitrary.  <br/><br/>I've encountered this sort of award system often in tournament modules, where you accumulate points based on choices/accomplishments at various points.  In my experience, I haven't liked it very much because it seemed like guessing what the GM thought you were supposed to do -- but there may be other variants.  <br/><br/>On a similar note, the Lord of the Rings RPG from Decipher has mission-based awards -- with a standard number of experience for achieving objectives.  In play, we often mocked this because it encouraged setting our sights as low as possible -- i.e. doing really simple, unchallenging things.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>So when people say that D&amp;D is about Killing Things and Taking Stuff, it's quite accurate. And that's just on the "what do we reward for?" side. On the reward side, what do you get? A level, right? What's the one thing that everyone gets with a level? Hit Points? Which are for? Combat (and surviving traps). So the output side is about combat too.<br/><br/>This is an intentional feature of D&amp;D, not a bug. If you don't like it, play something else.</blockquote>
Well, I mostly agree that one should generally play to the game's strength or play another game.  I dislike saying that D&amp;D is "about" killing things and taking stuff, because it equates "about" with the character actions done.  It's like saying that Sorcerer is about summoning and banishing demons.  In both cases it's a central activity which is expected to happen in the game, but that's not what the game is about.  I would say that most commonly, D&amp;D is about teamwork and resource management.  <br/><br/>For example, I had been planning my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/dawnoffire/" rel="nofollow"><b> "Dawn of Fire" </b></a> campaign in which the key action is still fighting and collecting items in a dungeon environment.  However, it has a very different context.                        </div>

                            I'll buy that, John, but by "about" I usually mean "what the characters do in play." I'd use the term "theme" or "premise" or something like that to refer to the deeper meaning of play, should there be one. But that's just semantics. <br/><br/>For certain, the challenge in D&amp;D is the resource management and working as a team. So, yeah, it's "about" that in terms of what it tests, sure. <br/><br/>Note that I love killing things and taking their stuff - I mostly do it in video games, but it's great fun. I like the challenges, too, but up front, it's the color of fighting stuff that's attractive. I play Warhammer minis. I could play WWII minis instead with the same challenges, but I find the cheesy color of a fantasy world and the black and white morality fun. <br/><br/>So I'm not denigrating it...I'm just calling the supported color what it is. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Well, the rub is that in theory the math of advancement in D&amp;D is pretty consistent, based upon some fixed number (14 maybe) encounters of your party's level being sufficient to level.  Provided that you pay attention to that thinking, a standard award can fit into that model very smoothly as part of the overal question of how long it should take to level.  Now, I'm not saying it can't be used abritrarily, but provided that same level of thought is put into it that is put into selecting any other challenge for the group, a structure exists to apply standard rewards as rigorously as anything else.<br/><br/>Now, is that structure clear or well supported? Hell no.  But it had some promise.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

... which leads directly to Blue Rose's "XP system" -- when the GM decides the characters should gain a level, he says so, and they do.<br/><br/>The concept of CR isn't broken, I'd say, but the implementation of it is.  As noted above, it's too combat-focused.<br/><br/>For my AD&amp;D2 campaign, way back when, I used a simple method of assigning XP -- namely, I decided how many XP a "mission" was worth, and the PCs got that XP when/if they completed it, regardless of how they did it.  I also took the "getting XP for doing things appropriate to your class" bit and used that, but with lots of modifications, since AD&amp;D2's implementation of that was so bad.<br/><br/>My favorite broken xD&amp;D experience bit, though, was in 1st edition AD&amp;D -- where 1 gp gotten from an adventure gave 1 xp... but training costs at low levels were higher than the XP cost to go up a level, so if you actually used the training rules, you forced slower advancement (since by the rules, XP earned while you were "waiting to train" didn't count).                        </div>

                            The GP = xp reward idea actually fufilled the basic idea: it's a fantasy heist.  It encouraged folks to figure out how to get treasure, whether through direct combat or through cleverness.  On the flip side, the training costs were a reactionary thing because you ended up with heroes with thousands of pieces of gold, and not really enough to do with it, except perhaps to pay for hirelings, which then made it possible to have mini-armies to clear dungeons...                        </div>

                            I can understand why, if one already plays DnD, one might well wish to use it to run games about stuff that isn't particularly combat driven.  Everyone in the group knows it, people own the rules, it's easy for them to drift as needed, there are tons of good reasons why DnD players might use it to run a whole host of different sorts of games.  I recall one chap who ran a game of intrigue among a city's courtesans running it and part of the reason for using DnD was simple familiarity with it and ease of pitching it to the players.<br/><br/>But, and here's the rub, those are all reasons to use it for stuff it's not ideally suited for.  Sometimes, although system matters, other factors make it genuinely preferable to use a less suitable system than one could.<br/><br/>Where that doesn't apply though, where one could easily use another system, why would one wish to use DnD for games that do not have combat as a major focus for play?<br/><br/>DnD is about tactical combat focussed play in which resource management is critical.  It can do far more than that, that's part of its strengths, but at it's heart it is about combat and the accumulation of power.  There can be good reasons to play it with other goals, but they're not what it's best at.<br/><br/>So, because the game is not just killing things and taking their stuff you can get xp for other things, but because the primary focus of the game is killing things and taking their stuff that is what is most consistently rewarded by the rules.                        </div>

My last long-term campaign of D&amp;D (1 year or so), in which I was a player, used this system.  I didn't like it.<br/>
<br/>
It made me want to avoid the thing I like best about D&amp;D - really hard combats.  Treasure became the main motivator because there was nothing I could do, as a player, to get more XP.  (Except not die - so I became paranoid and didn't want to take risks, which really messes with my D&amp;D fun.)  But we were sticking pretty close to the standard wealth by character level table, so there wasn't much chance to grab more loot.<br/>
<br/>
If there had been a "story" in the game, it would have been fine.  There wasn't.                        </div>

I wonder how many people who are using D&amp;D for something else "because we all know the rules" are also of the "toss out rules that don't fit the campaign" are actually basing their entire commonness on something like: "There are 6 attributes which range in values historically tied to 3d6."<br><br>Of course it's also amusing when a group is using D&amp;D for something way far from "kill things and take their treasure" advertises for D&amp;D players (with something like "We ROLE play, not roll play.") is then upset when a player comes along and starts killing things and taking their treasure...<br><br>Are there any other game hobbies where people claim they're playing some standard game when actually they're playing something entirely different? I guess poker is a bit like that.<br><br>Frank                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Heh. Too true. <br/><br/>But there is a difference between "playing for different reasons" and "playing in different ways." <br/><br/>OTOH, how many of you have spent a lot of time playing football (American football) when you don't have a full field and body gear? I've played a lot of it over the years, and the number of rules variations you find (especially between different states) can get pretty wild. I've seen everything between the standards of two-hand touch, four count before a rush, and two completions is a first down to free latteral passes that go forward and near rugbey rules. Most of the time you can tell you're playing football, but there have been a few times where it got close to the line. But never did anyone call it anything other than "football."                        </div>

This is the main reason why I'm very dubious about "story award" and "level up every X session" systems for D&amp;D. All of the permutations I've seen are essentially, "You level up when the DM feels like it." I guess I just don't see the point.                        </div>

                            I don't think I noticed someone mentioning the big picture of experience awards so please forgive if I missed it in the thread...<br/><br/>Note also that XP awards are meant to level PCs in established intervals.  It is assumed that the characters will level once every four sessions.  An equal CR assumes that it will deplete a four man party of the same level 20-25% of it's resources in an encounter and in an average number of encounters for a four hour session this comes out to be roughly 1/4 of the experience needed to get to the next level.  I think this is an important part of the equation.  Sure, D&amp;D is made to kill stuff and get treasure (ie XP) and by removing the kill stuff from the formula you certainly break the intent.  However, we found it an important part of the design to understand that players get really antsy if the level every four sessions isn't adhered to (explicitly or subtely).  As a general rule we just play and every four levels the PCs level unless there are extraordinary circumstances.<br/><br/>A special note: I played a lot of D&amp;D for several years between 2000 and 2003.  A LOT of D&amp;D (including being one of the Keoland Triad for Living Grayhawk).  I railed against it after a while and it certainly is at the bottom tier of games I will play.  However, it raised considerably once I removed leveling from the game.  Granted I also tend to run True20.  <br/><br/>In regards to "rules create play" I found too many folk think more about leveling (myself included) than about the process at hand.  By removing it I have had a lot of success bringing more focused play to bear where the players begin to care more about what the character can do now, and not so much what it WILL be able to do.<br/><br/>D20 isn't just a VAST improvement over prior D&amp;D/AD&amp;D incarnations, it's a pretty solid game as general task resolution goes.  IMHO it still is bottom tier in many respects but that is due to so many cool games out there, rather than just it's own suckage.                        </div>

                            As an addendum to my last post, some might suggest that it would be dull to have a campaign where the characters never get better.  There is advancement but it tends to be consequences and rewards in it's own right.  For instance, through roleplaying and accomplishing mission/objectives characters gain allegiences with organizations that can teach them feats, spells and resources to gain items with bonuses (for both combat and non-combat applications).  It's just more oriented toward actual play instead of abstracted in a level based system.  <br/><br/>Does it change D&amp;D?  Certainly.  The goal is something closer to a d20 OGL, I suppose.

Leveling up is certainly fun; it's the carrot on the D&amp;D stick.<br/><br/>But I didn't say that <em>leveling up</em> isn't fun; you're putting words in my mouth. I said that I don't see the point in severing the tie between what I do with my PC in the game and that PC's advancement. If my PC levels up ever four sessions, no matter what, you're rewarding him for attednance, and nothing else.<br/><br/>"Story rewards" can work, but I think often they become (as others have said) a reward for figuring out what the DM wanted you to do. They also, IMO, don't push the players to make use of 90% of the numbers on their sheet.<br/><br/>Still, alternatives can work as long as there are specific, known criteria for reward that allow my choices to have meaning. Implementation aside, that's why I like ideas like Sweet20's keys.<br/><br/>Of course, not everyone cares about this stuff. Balbinus' points aside, what puzzles me is why this sort of player continues to play D&amp;D.                        </div>

                            I have run D&amp;D where characters never advanced.  In that case, though, the idea that advancement wouldn't happen was put forward to the players beforehand, and everyone agreed to it.<br/>
<br/>
The reason we did it was because we'd discovered that we had the most fun around level 5 or 6 -- where a group of one or two hit-dice opponents could still be a challenge, but characters had a big enough hit point buffer that they didn't have to worry about dying in every little encounter.                        </div>

                            XP rules were the first thing to go out of the door in our campaign. We actually measured experience by the number of "dungeons" (adventures) completed. So, from 1st to 2nd level required a single "dungeon" worth of experience. Then 2 more for 3rd level, then 3 more for 4th, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There was a bit of drift; a really long adventure might count as one-and-a-half or two "dungeons" of experience, and sometimes we'd stop to award a "dungeon" at the end of a session (but in the middle of an adventure).<br/>
<br/>
What I really liked about this system is that it reinforced the concept of mission-based play, as opposed to just kill the monsters and take their stuff (there was a lot of that too).                        </div>

Yeah, but...<br/>
<br/>
When I cast Overland Flight, used my Ring of Invisibility, and told the rest of the party to get into the Bag(s) of Holding that we had in order to get past the guards at the bridge - it would have been really cool if I got XP for that.  (I'm not sure if it would have been better if I, alone, got the XP for the guards at the bridge, or if we all shared the XP.)<br/>
<br/>
The high-fives that I got for doing that were cool, but it would have been ever better if I got XP for it.                        </div>

                            Yeah, D&amp;D has always been super fuzzy in that regard.  <br><br>In principle, you should have gotten xp for "beating" the guards, but D&amp;D does very little to guide folks on how non-combat challenges are still worth xp, other than a very fuzzy GM Fiat.  2nd edition came a little closer in that you got rewarded for using your class abilities (magic, thief skills, etc.) to solve problems, and I think skills (aka, non-weapon proficiencies- what an awesome name), got you something like 25 xp or so per successful use.<br><br>The unstated issue, is that D&amp;D only specifically awards you xp if your character's life is immediately on the line.  Therefore, getting into or not into the castle, managing to evade pursuers or not, successfully or failing to negotiate a peace treaty, all sit on the GM's whim.  This being the case, you'll find many gamists simply focus on combat because it's the only place they're a) guaranteed of having rules they can negotiate with, and b) a guaranteed reward for a definable behavior.<br><br>Agon nicely resolves much of this, because it follows a simple formula:  Dice rolls always have a risk of damaging your resources, and a reward of Glory.  Therefore, everytime the dice get used, a player knows what's at stake and what's to be gained.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            D&amp;D 3.0+ gives explicit rewards for combat &amp; traps, everything else is GM fiaty.  Both monsters and traps get CRs, while everything else is "as thou wilt". <br><br>Older editions had a couple other options: OD&amp;D rewarded for gold, so stuff like getting past guards could be considered "rewarded"  in that you conserved resources (magic, hp) and got gold, which turned into xp.

                            It seems to me--having never actually played it--is that you could treat non-combat stuff based on the CR of your opponent for that subset of the rules.<br><br/>Like, out-talking an evil bard would be worth XP where "social CR = bard level."  Sneaking past a guard (who probably has levels in Warrior) would be worth "sneaking CR = 1/2 warrior level," since the alertness skills are cross-class.  <br/><br/>You could probably use these principles to eyeball the rest of it.  It wouldn't be perfect, but it would get you through.                        </br></div>

                            I think it's also pretty clear that if an encounter was intended to be a combat encounter, and the PCs bypass the encounter using social skills, or magic, then it would count as full XP. I think there are some hazy situations still, and maybe the solution for them is to fall back to your creative agenda. If the CA is gamism, ask, did the players game their way out? Just noticing there is a bypass coridor might not count as overcoming the encounter, but if the PCs had to use resources, then it probably should count. For other CAs, apply similar logic (and consider how XP overall fits into the reward cycle for your CA). The appeal to CA may be the solution for how much XP to give the PCs for causing an avalance that kills an entire army (when the intended encounter was they defeat a detachment of guards and sneak by the camp).<br/><br/>I think it's also important to consider the reward mechanics when setting up the encounters.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            Johua RamaTutenkaman, <br/><br/>That depends on if you also have the Improved Bluff feat, and how many HP you have. Because taking on an ogre when you're down into single digit HP isn't the smart move. At that point you need to get to someplace you can reup your resources and return to kill the ogre later.                        </div>

                            I agree with ffilz.  Overcoming is overcoming.  You do get XP for talking your way past the Ogre.  Overcoming the CR is overcoming the CR.  <br/><br/>However, in a purely gamist perspective you can only use Diplomacy and Intimidate to shift the target's attitude to a more friedly setting.  The problem becomes that if the GM decides that the Ogre is already Hostile then there is no Diplomacy (it takes a minute to apply and Ogre should officially be "taking risks to harm you").  One character would have to Intimidate him from Hostile to Friendly (one action) and then the Diplomat can solidify the Friendly.  The arguement might be that if the Orge is friendly then there is no threat but if he didn't start out Friendly then you've overcome the obstacle and should get his XP especially since his skills are based on his hit dice and hit dice are the raw basis for CR.  It gets sticky if your GM did not set the attitude to Hostile.  Unfriendly targets simply wish you ill will so the PC's may not be in any immediate danger.  The PCs may have to either jack up the attitude to Hostile or the CR should be lowered appropriately to reflect the easier situation.<br/><br/>Can we tell I played this game far too long?

<p>So, how <em>do</em> you measure the CR of a non-combat encounter? (Rather, one where the expected solution is non-combat.)</p>
<p>I'm thinking that, for skill checks, this is easy. CR equal to party level is supposed to exhaust 25% of your resources, right? So I'm thinking you can scale CR by DC, where equal CR is where an average character with max class ranks fails 25% of the time. Or some other number. Math people?</p>
<p>It's less transparent to me for utility magic.</p>

                            Mike: Of course it's 3.x, Challenge Rating is a 3.x concept...<br/><br/>Shreyas: Actually it's 20%. But I think that really only applies to combat and trap encounters. A pure skill encounter would not use any resources unless spells or expendable magic items are required. But what you can do to start is look at what they would have to fight if they don't use the skill. So the ogre who can be diplomacied (but will certainly fight otherwise) would be worth his normal CR.<br/><br/>But perhaps an encounter has to have some risk, in which case resources are at least at risk. In that case, the secret door, which is just going to take a skill roll to find, is not worth anything (and indeed, no 3.x module I have ever read has given an EL or any note of experience for a simple door).<br/><br/>I do think the further you stray from pure combat encounters, the worse the D&amp;D system works. Diplomacy and other sorts of combat bypass tricks on the part of the players have always been troublesome to (some) GMs, and that's the source of the angst about how much XP to award.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

Right -- that's what we've been saying.  It's troublesome because (1) the CR rating is based on combat ability, and (2) the meaning of "defeat" is usually unclear when applied to non-combat situations.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Shreyas Sampat</cite>Frank, I'm assuming "you only have one opportunity to roll", which I guess is drifting D&amp;D in a big way. Your opportunity is the resource in question.</blockquote>
Actually, the D&amp;D3 rules specify "No retries" for a number of skills, including Diplomacy.  So that's by-the-book rather than drifting.                        </div>

We need solid rules for Social Conflict, which would pave the way for tangible XP rewards, tied to the Challenge Rating of the guy(s) you've been arguing with. And, as always, you can refuse a Duel, and choose to bludgeon them to death.                        </div>

But Duel of Wits is not how you do verbal battles.<br/><br/>It's how you take care of a meta-disagreement mirrored by in-character verbal battles. I just tried to do a Duel of Wits the other day: it didn't work because their wasn't a player to player disagreement solid enough to argue about. The character and the NPC were arguing, but I as the GM had no desire to argue about what the player wanted.                        </div>

Except I enjoy roleplaying scenes that don't necessarily come to a roll. We roleplayed the scene that I'm referring to, and, at the end, said yes. We were still invested in playing out the scene.                        </div>

                            I don't think Frank is saying to skip playing it out - that determination will still be made on a case by case basis. He's just saying not to roll the dice. <br/><br/>Further, I just want to check in that everybody understands that the "roll" or "role" dichotomy implicit here is a false dichotomy, right? That resolving a conflict via rolling doesn't mean that first person portrayal of the dialog involved has to dissapear? <br/><br/>That all said, I think it might be time to do a thread drift check. That is, the thread was really about what the system in D&amp;D3 supports, and now it's getting into how to make it support other things by adding to the system present. That might make for a good additional thread all it's own. Josh? <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            We digress...<br/><br/>There is another consideration when considering the social approaches to D&amp;D 3.x - what the other players have invested in.  <br/><br/>Although I agree that a Diplomacy roll probably would lower the CR dramatically because lack of real threatened resources I also question it's approach due to how it would de-protaganize the other PCs.  Unless you establish a social conflict resolution mechanic (I will have to check out the <i>Dynasties &amp; Demogogues</i> mentioned here) and your PCs are ready and setup to make the game be about THAT most of your PCs will have combat feats and +2 magic swords and beefy physical stats.  I would think that if a PC waltzed through the campaign making friends the other players would start to get ansty (at best).  Anyone do any analysis on the amount of "combatiness" involved in character choices?  Even for the social ones it's mighty hefty (I would be surprised if it's not over 75% of character development options).<br/><br/>So this is why I think the investment of party resources is an important part of the CR mechanic.  I think it's a good way to approach CR... maybe even AFTER an encounter.  This may be a cool way of setting up encounters not of the combat persuassion, by seeing to it that it requires the expenditure of resources.  Maybe social conflicts require promises of service and/or gold and items - bargaining and otherwise proving ones worth to the target.                        </div>

                            Fred - yes, but...<br/><br/>I think a key point of "say yes or roll the dice" is to focus on what the everyone is invested in. If no one is invested in the struggle to climb a wall, and everyone wants the wall to be climbed, be very brief. If there is a social encounter that people are invested in getting some information or some result, but everyone wants the same result, then take the time to do the talky stuff to everyone's satisfaction (keeping a close eye out for eyes glazing over). If there's a conflict that people are invested in, then break out the dice, and sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>And Mike is right - this thread seems to be wandering...<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>
