                    So there's this <i>moment</i> that is common to most of the stories I'm reading these days.  It is the moment in which a character realizes that they have been horribly wrong about themselves and their place in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Ferinstance, in <i>Shaman King</i>, I just read a lovely little piece with Tao Ren.  Ren is an abused young man from a horribly dysfunctional shaman family.  He believes in strength.  He believes that friendship and human association is for the weak, and the weak are to be destroyed.  This philosophy works for him for a long time.  And then ... it stops working so well.  Another shaman defeats him and (worse!) befriends him.  Ren starts doubting himself.   He goes back to his home in order to confront (and hopefully defeat) his father, to still his doubts.  He gets his ass handed to him.  His friends come to rescue him from the dungeons, and he tells them to sod off, this isn't their fight, he'll handle it on his own (even beaten and tortured and exhausted).  His friends tag along anyway.  They get beaten and savaged by Ren's father, and his father hammers him over and over again ... "You're weak!"<br/>
<br/>
And then we have The Moment.
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Ren:  Yes, I am weak ... but it's because I'm weak that I'm fighting you.<br/>
Friends variously get up, go to join Ren<br/>
Father:  Impossible!  Why are you getting up?  Don't you fear me?  Why do you fight so hard for one another?!<br/>
Ren:  I can't answer that.  But I know that if I were in their place ... I'd do the same for them.</div>
</blockquote>
Now there is also the <i>opposite</i> moment ... when someone confronts the fact that they're wrong, and can take no power from it (Faith, in <i>Buffy</i>, turning her failures as a Slayer into a bitter rage that ultimately destroys her).  Sometimes their failures crush them.  There is <b>something</b> that happens before that moment of crisis, some build-up, that makes one outcome or another natural.  By the time he reaches his crisis, Ren couldn't look at weakness and be broken by it.  By the time she reaches her crisis, Faith couldn't look at her failings and take strength from them.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm going to be reviewing a lot of my favorite fiction, looking specifically at these moments, what builds up to them, and what correlates with my sense of the inevitable.  I'd like to figure out what actually goes along with each moment, so I can build those patterns into my system.  But it'll be a lot easier for me if people can give me some first hypotheses ... patterns I can be mindful of as I'm looking through the source material.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of things would you watch for that you'd expect to go along with a story where a character gains strength by being compelled to redefine themselves?<br/>

                            "You will deny me three times"<br><br>A common feature I've noticed is where the character is blatantly confronted by the fact that they're wrong and we can see it, and the people around them can see it, and <i>they</i> can see it, but they decide to ignore it and deliberately make the "wrong" decision.<br><br>That's the turning point.

But my main question isn't about what correlates with <b>either</b> of the types of change, but rather which correlates with only one or the other.  Does that distinction make sense?

Now, what goes along with somebody who is going to acknowledge their wrongness and change themselves (gaining power)?

Why are you hitting yourself in the head with a freaking hammer?<br/>FIRST MAN: Because it feels so good when I stop!<br/><br/>It's much easier to realize you're wrong -- to give up an illusion you had about the world or yourself -- when you realize that being wrong was <i>hurting</i> you, and all you have to do to feel better is stop:<br/><br/>"Hey, I don't have to hit myself on the head with this hammer in order to feel good later! I can just stop, and feel good all the time!"<br/>"Hey, I don't have to drink myself stupid to get through the day!

I can be weak and have friends!"<br/><br/>Looked at this way,  giving up what you believed about yourself is like setting down a heavy load of baggage.

The question that I come away with, Tony, is why a player will want to go with the second.  Or will the player be trying to bring their character to a point of epiphany, and if they fail to do so their character will be broken by their circumstances?  Cause really, who wants to play Faith without wanting to play Faith in an alternate scenario where she manages to pull off some measure of victory?                        </div>

                            Sydney:  Yes and no.  You get to put down <b>one type</b> of pain in order to pick up another.  The only way to have a self-image that is pain-free is to quickly elide the rest of the story into "And he lived happily ever after, the end!"  Otherwise, you're just trading one way of living for another way of living, and living leads, among other things, to pain ... at least if you're telling a halfway decent story.<br/>

<div class="QuoteText">"I can do you blood and love without the rhetoric, and I can do you blood and rhetoric without the love, and I can do you all three concurrent or consecutive, but I can't do you love and rhetoric without the blood.  Blood is compulsory -- they're all blood, you see."<br/>

So, again, I <i>agree</i> that letting go of who you were is in some ways a relief, but it's a relief for Ren the same way it's a relief for Faith, isn't it?  It's not the thing that makes the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.  Maybe it's not the things that happen before that prepare a certain type of outcome.  Maybe it's what happens <i>immediately after</i>.  Maybe everybody is the same in that moment when they are (for an instant) nothing ... and what changes everything is not anything they can do, but what the people around them do for them or to them in that instant of weakness.  Maybe the difference is that when Ren put it all out on the line, he had friends around him who stepped up and gave him a new person to be ... and when Faith had come to the end of her rope, she didn't have anyone like that (or, rather, she had the Mayor, who glibly took her hand and started leading her down the path to her own doom).                        </div>

Yes, I'm sure that most players would <i>prefer</i> that when that moment happens their character gains strength and victory from it.  But then, most players would prefer that when they fight the dragon they survive and triumph, and some games thrive on the <i>possibility</i> that they will instead become dragon-chow.  <br><br>Likewise, I want the present possibility that your characters angst will break them to be a motivating factor for a player playing the game.  They should play the game in such a way that, if they are forced to a breakdown, it makes perfect sense to everyone (even the GM who drove them to the breakdown) that they should come out the other side stronger.                        </br></br></div>

                            What I'm getting at (and it's sort of off-topic, so tell me to shove it or start a different thread or take it to whispers) is this, and correct me if I'm wrong: at some point, the character will come to the breaking point and something must change and something <em>will</em> change.  The change is inevitable, yes?  And one kind of change is good (the self-actualizing version), and one kind of change is bad (the self-destruction version).  If character change is inevitable, would it be in-line with your plans for the <em>players</em> to be trying to get their willful characters to change in the good way, rather than the bad way?  And then build up a resolution system around that?                        </div>

                            Edit: A few posts since Is tarted writing mine that create a lot of new ideas. Back when I have time.<br><br>I've been kicking a similar idea around in my head as well.<br>One thing to notice in Shaman King is the strong theme of following your dream and sticking to your path to it. In many animes there is a theme that affects the whole show like that. In Naruto its finding your place and accepting it or creating your place and having others accept you there. Gantz its something about trust. Flames of Recca its about providing protection.<br/>When Ren went against his farther he was strong because his own dream/path and followed it rather then his farther's path. His friends being a part of that path and being there strengthened it.<br/>Now the opposite moment is in the same scene but with Ren's farther. He sees too much that contradicts his path (Ren's friends helping and his children rebelling since having lost belief in his path/dream.) causes him to break at his moment of crises.<br/><br/>Like a key the player would have conditions that would increase their belief.<br/>But also condition to increase their doubt.<br/>Then at a crises point you would be stronger if your belief was higher but weaker if your doubt was higher.<br/>Aside from being challenged in your path (Flames of Recca has a good series of fights near the end where the bad guys conspire to put him in situations that would lead him to doubt) what causes a crises point is interesting in its own right.<br/>"Relief in letting go" bears some thought as well but i need to t back to work now.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>  But my main question isn't about what correlates with<b>either</b>of the types of change, but rather which correlates with only one or the other.  Does that distinction make sense?</blockquote>
Sorry - yes, that makes sense.  I'm having trouble coming up with any telltale signs about what which direction a character's going to fall though.<br/><br/>I know that uncertainty=drama is true for most things and so is not terribly useful, but I'm having real trouble coming up with what's powerful and interesting about those kind of decision points <i>other than</i> the fact that the audience feels it could go either way.  <br/><br/>Sorry not to be more helpful, but I suspect that the nifty of those moments <i>is</i> the uncertainty.  The more that the outcome is telegraphed, the weaker that moment of revelation is.  Excepting of course those cases where the character makes a decision you weren't expecting.  The author makes you like characters so you want to see them triumphant, but it could be equally be so you enjoy it when they make the right decision, or so that you really feel it when they turn away from the light.<br/><br/>Actually, maybe something useful could be wrung from that afterall.  If I'm right and audience expectations/interest <i>are</i> the major thing that determines how interesting those moments are, then perhaps you could use that somehow.  Would it be worth the effort to formalise monitoring player expectations - some kind of risk-reward system? (I bet 3 chips that he turns to the dark side!)  I don't know.<br/><br/>On a different note, I think strength vs weakness might be a bit of a red herring here.  It's true that the people who make the right decision about who they are usually win - but the good guys normally win, don't they?  Power leads to winning, so putting yourself on the winning side often involves a gain in strength (or success at the least - which can look an awful lot like power).   Correlation, but not causation.<br/><br/>I see it more as the character's actions and their nature being in conflict.  So they either change their actions to accord with their nature (renounce their previous way of life), or they change their nature to accord with their actions (re-define their principles to justify what they've been doing).  And either of those transformations can be triumphant, depending on context.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>who wants to play Faith without wanting to play Faith in an alternate scenario where she manages to pull off some measure of victory?</blockquote>
Just to be difficult... Me. I quite often enjoy playing characters who are badly, badly, badly wrong. They've put their faith and their self-image into something that doesn't work, that is hurting them and/or those around them. And sometimes, I don't want them to overcome that. I want them to burn for it. I want them damned. Especially after I've played through enough of the hurting.<br/><br/>Of course, the really, really cool outcome is when the character does break, gives in to being damned, and then someone else decides to save them anyway. Kicking and screaming.                        </div>

That's what I'm trying to figure out:  What are the things that the players should be doing, such that when the change comes and their character changes to empower themselves, everybody at the table is cool with that?  If I can figure out what things make that happen in a story then I can make a rules-set that also rewards those things, and the rules will parallel our natural sense of story.

And you want to be doing the kicking and screaming part, Mark, not the saving part?  When we're talking about "your" character, of course.<br/><br/>Tony, I can only articulate one item on those lists that you're trying to formulate: the internal contradiction.  If a character has a strong belief in something ("The prophet's teachings spread peace."), he may be presented with something that displays an internal contradiction of that belief ("The prophet ordered the paladins to slaughter these peasants?").  When this <em>is</em> a real contradiction, it leads to the dissolution of that belief.  Often times, however, the character discovers or formulates a means by which the apparent contradiction is not a contradiction at all, after which the belief is upheld and strenthened.                        </div>

Absolutely. Yes. Actual Play: Hopelessly self-destructive Anarch Ball-of-Rage (me), rebelling against everything in sight in an increasingly spectacular effort at "suicide by {insert authority figure here}", and the mad innocent of a bookish, quiet Malkavian who stopped him. My intent with the character had been simply to blow him up real good. What happened instead was much cooler. Rage and resentment got turned into protectiveness and <i>folie a deux</i> when faced with someone who would NOT be driven away by rage.<br/><br/>I like it when my characters surprise me. I've often found that happens better when I find something to love about a character who I started out hating.                        </div>

i'd say that theres a fair amount of self destruction in self actualization.<br/>change is change.  assigning "good" or "bad" changes are somewhat pointless.  what's "good" for the story(THEME)?                        </div>

                            From my angle, for the story the change just needs to take place and be, as Tony is trying to articulate, understandable and sensible to the audience.  From the game angle, though, players tend to work towards empowerment.  If the story requires change, the game can be about whether the change is empowering or not.                        </div>

<p>The book <em>Radical Honesty</em> has an interesting take on which way the cards are likely to fall.</p>
<p>Basically, the notion is that we learn about moral correctness in a couple of different ways. The more common (sadly) way is that we are required to absorb someone else's scorn, anger, and judgment about our wrongful behaviour, and are not allowed to emote. The greater the degree of this disjunct (the authority gets to feel but we don't), the more likely that future encounters with similar situations will be accompanied by moralizing. (Thus, someone who is beaten when she is caught stealing, and who is enjoined to take punishment like a grown-up, and who is given no empathy, is more likely to regard thieves as scum, and to beat herself up when she does stealing-like behaviour.)</p>
<p>I think the missing ingredient (if you want to mechanize this kind of thing beyond the excellent Keys system) is simply neurotic blocks. Even neurotic behaviour is attempting to fulfill some legitimate need; the problem is in sticking to that behaviour in the face of all evidence. ("Insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results," as the saying goes.) Do you love your idea of yourself more, or the truth? Faith expressed that "love," of course, in a deeply hateful way, both to herself and others; but it is worth noting that she was at all times attempting to protect herself from getting hurt. But she was stuck on the notion that exposing herself was too shameful to survive, so she must not do it; a way to ensure she would not do so was to receive that punishment, in advance, from herself, with utmost interior (and often exterior, 'cause hey, this is TV) violence. Thus "helpfully" pre-abused, she would be less likely to take the chance that Buffy or whoever might look at her and destroy her.</p>
<p>Obviously this cuts to the core of what it is to be a flawed human being, tough stuff to pin down for a game.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to say that characters are always empowered by change, in a neutral sense. Does the self that interacts as honestly as possible with the world get empowered, or does "the only way I can stay safe is never to let on what a loser I am 6d4" get empowered? For someone who is good and messed up, a generous act on someone else's part can be an opportunity for (potentially gameable) conflict, as can a seemingly low-cost opportunity for generosity or openness of their own. Here's a real-world interior conflict I have witnessed literally dozens of times that leads to minor verbal violence:</p>
<p>Me (pimping for charity on the street, clipboard in hand): "Hi, got a moment for Amnesty International?"</p>
<p>Them (internal 1): "I want to help!" (This is one of the most natural reactions in the world.)</p>
<pre><code>     (internal 2): "No way. It's not safe, we can't afford it." (Also natural)

     (internal 1): "Sure we can."

     (internal 2): "Piss off. You don't appreciate how the world really works."
</code></pre>
<p>(At this point, a decision has already been reached--actually it probably was reached on the pre-verbal level.)</p>
<pre><code>    (internal 3) (actually a variant of 2): goddamnit. I suck. I'm so selfish. (Now trying to protect against falling into an overly self-absorbed personality. Ironically.)

    (internal everyone): "Arrrgh!" (A state of pain brought on by conflicting values)

    (internal 2): "We're under attack! Retaliate! Protect the human!"
</code></pre>
<p>Them, outside voice: "Fuck off!"</p>
<p>On days when I was less busy with my own internal wars, this little conflict played out very clearly on a person's face <em>every time</em> they responded with hostility. OK, long silly ramble about canvassing aside, my reflection is that it would work to have players have the choice of what to feed--either a personality structure that needs defending, though it could be tactically useful in some way, or a more general benefit of some kind (though perhaps not as immediately effective).</p>
<p>To return to Buffy, it's interesting that of course the title character nearly always chose to defend some pretty freaking neurotic patterns when presented with information, but when the chips were down she usually did choose to trust her friends, which was humbling, but usually less fatal than how Faith turned out. I'd say it was her strength of community that usually allowed her to do that (as someone else pointed out earlier). That's been mechanically represented for a while now; so someone with more relationship aspects, qualities, skills, ratings, or whatever, seems likelier to be able to chance pumping up neurosis for a while until the climactic scene, while someone without those useful attachments is more likely to get burned.</p>
<p>Does all that make a lick of sense? I'm just riffing here and it's 1:00 AM. So I might be nuts. But I do always enjoy this kind of thing, so thanks Tony, interesting topic.</p>

                            Lets try this for some possible patterns that cause one or the other. Most of these have examples since I came up with them reading a lot Shonen Jump mangas (Published Shaman King and others) so its slanted in that direction.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>What kind of things would you watch for that you'd expect to go along with a story where a character gains strength by being compelled to redefine themselves?</blockquote>
When they gain more power they often know what they want to do but have doubt/uncertainty about actually doing it and once that doubt is removed they are free to go on.<br/>What they are doing is ongoing<br/>They were treated fairly by their opponent or had a chance to show what they could do

They break because when the move on there is nothing there for them or they are uncertain of what they should do next. The only opportunity to go on it to bring things to an end or die.<br/>Not rising above his bad past<br/>Represents some negative aspect of the setting<br/>Supporting characters want him to fail/no supporting characters<br/>They want someone else to change them<br/>Nothing to look forward to/They need to do<br/>Have thrown everything else away for what they have<br/><br/>Edit: For some reason i have a giant space here before the next part. Anyone know why?<br/><br/>Things that have opposites:

                            The more I look at the source material, the more correlation I see on the question of <i>What other people say</i> right after your moment of crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, I think I could almost define the moment of crisis (sort of ass-backwards) as "The moment when you make yourself so vulnerable that the next thing people say about you will be something you <b>must</b> take to heart, good or bad."<br/>
<br/>
'course, I've started watching <i>Gunslinger Girl</i>, which is horribly, brutally tragic in this particular respect.  The whole first episode is about people telling a little girl, over and over, "You are a killing machine, an assassin, cold and emotionless," and she <i>accepts that</i>, because it's the only way she knows to try to help her big-brother-type handler.  This leads to a crisis where she admits "I just did it because I wanted ... I wanted to be able to help you!" and the handler responds merely "We'll have that wound looked at when we get back home."<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sitting there, looking at that, thinking "Aw damn man ... you <b>broke her</b>.  Again."<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhhhhh .... had a thought on mechanics.  Making a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2383" rel="nofollow">new thread</a> to discuss it, since it tangents a bit off of where I am right here and now.                        </div>
