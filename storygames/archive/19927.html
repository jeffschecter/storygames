It's only $3/game, and I think it could be a really cool way to springboard new designers. Seriously, I think we're going to make our goal, but it's only going to be with the community's support.</b><br/><br/>So I think I have three thoughts:<br/><br/>The reason why Different play exists is because I wanted to do <b>something</b>. I'm not certain on what the best something is, and the structure is made to try out different ideas: is raising money directly helpful? Is it about providing lots of expert help to up and coming designers? Maybe just raising the visibility of existing games? So part of this is an experiment: what are ways that are helpful, and how can we get the community behind some initiatives.<br/><br/>The reason why I think the Patreon is exciting to me is that I think there's fantastic people with fantastic ideas who do not have the time/resources/courage to call themselves game designers. I've seen two of the people who won a recent freeform contest struggle with whether to identify themselves as designers, and kind of aw, shucks, I'm not really that. Screw that: both of them not only designed a game, but won a competition with a lot of entrants. I hope that by offering lots of support, and resources in getting a game from idea to publishable, that that'll help with that. I think it's already been verified to me that there are tons of great designers from more diverse backgrounds out there, and it's about making sure they get heard.<br/><br/>And partially, I've just been invigorated by a lot in the digital games scene, and a lot of what I've found awesome there is from people totally outside the hobby. I think our first few designers are probably going to be people I know, but I would be totally invigorated to see what people from completely other fields made.<br/><br/>Any questions? Any thoughts? I'd love to hear your feedback: this is a very mutable enterprise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440989/#Comment_440989" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-21T07:40:37+00:00" title="December 21, 2014  7:40AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2014 3:05AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>A couple of thoughts</b>:<br/><br/>I love this Patreon.<br/><br/>The $3 price-point to contribute resources for development and to get a copy of the game seems great to me.<br/><br/>The structure of choosing games and helping produce them reminds me of how a studio works.<br/><br/><br/><b>A couple of questions</b>:<br/><br/>What were your thoughts about inviting Patreon supporters to be involved in the playtesting phase?
