I learn by giving feedback on other people's games. The first year I participated in Game Chef, I gave a metric fuckload (10<sup>3</sup> shitloads) of feedback. I also got useful feedback on my own, rather immature, design, from people I didn't usually get feedback from. I'm talking about feedback during the competition, by the way, not after it.<br/><br/>So I'd like to find a way of making feedback work. How could this happen? Mandatory feedback doesn't seem right. And there needs to be some way, surely, of choosing the games you give feedback on.<br/><br/>How can this work? How can you avoid someone getting no feedback? Perhaps by having a house rule, in a forum, that you should reply to any post that's been unanswered, after a time. But then how do you avoid the situation where the only feedback you get is "This is great, keep going!"? How should it work technically? A forum, blogs, something else?<br/><br/>Let's assume we're talking about a hypothetical future game competition, not Game Chef. I'd genuinely like to make centrally-organised feedback work, like it worked for me in that first Game Chef. How can it?<br/><br/>As usual, I'd really appreciate it if you could post slowly and thoughtfully. Many thanks.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230438/#Comment_230438" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T14:43:54+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  2:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am asking this questioun seriously, but why doesn't mandatory feedback seem right?<br/><br/>I think it's irrelevant whether other people find it not right, do you find it not right, and if so, why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230440/#Comment_230440" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T14:59:35+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  2:59PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2009 3:01PM by Double King.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the first thing that popped into my head was something similar to the current layout for GC but with an additional column for public commentary.  left column: info, news, admin stuff; center column the blogroll posts; right column public feed.

Of course I'm not any of those guys so maybe I'm wrong!<br/><br/>Also agree that mandatory constructive feedback managed and facilitated by a central authority is, for me, the best (and, frankly, only) reason to get involved in a game design contest. <br/><br/>I liked how GC08 did it: you start with a feedback group during the prerelease phase, then receive a couple games outside of your feedback group, and your game is reviewed by a couple people outside your feedback group. Seems like a lot of fancy footwork for the facilitators, and naturally there's no guarantee that any of your critics will deliver the feedback you need. I have no idea if there is ANY way to guarantee good criticism. My GC08 feedback was decidedly mixed: one very in-depth breakdown, a few shallow read-throughs, and LOTS of attaboys.<br/><br/>I think probably very clear guidelines on what will be required for the criticism phase goes a long way, and should be used as a benchmark for anyone participating in the event: not only will you be required to answer, say, 20 questions about each game you receive, you will receive 20 answers from each of your critics.<br/><br/>What about <i>requiring</i> a playtest round? I know some (many?) GC participants would be forced to opt out if this were the case, but c'est la vie. These games need to be played, not just written for approval or social points-earning or whatever. I'm betting a little up-front work via Skype could actually facilitate pick-up playtest groups for those folks who don't have live playtesters at hand.<br/><br/>Per Walton's current setup, maybe running a live playtest earns you a token or badge or some other kind of recognition.

I think that in an ideal feedback situation you would try to achieve both of those.<br/><br/>I'm participating in Game Chef this year, but as a total newcomer to it and to RPG design, I've got a bit of a psychological "barrier to entry" on giving other people feedback because I don't consider myself qualified to give a ton of advice. I think a mandatory feedback mechanism (maybe with a voluntary opt-in) would be useful for people in my position in getting over that barrier and doing some in-depth reading of other people's entries. In terms of getting people to give quality feedback, I think one way is to figure out a way to mimic the spotlight effect of saying "OK, it's X's turn to give feedback on Y's game! What do you think X?" X will want to have something useful to say to avoid looking dumb. <br/><br/>You probably also want to match people in terms of the amount of effort they're willing/able to put in. If someone who puts several hours a day into the process is only getting feedback from someone who puts several hours a week in, the first person is probably going to be disappointed and the second person might get overwhelmed by the amount of feedback they get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230839/#Comment_230839" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T11:47:20+00:00" title="September  9, 2009 11:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite><br/>I have heard (in the context of writers groups for fiction writing, but I think it probably applies to game design as well) </blockquote>\nActually, looking at how workshopping works in fiction writing is probably a good place to start.

As an example, someone might have little to no interest in historical games or violent games, and thus give low-utility or minimal feedback in a group where most other designers are latching onto such themes.<br/><br/>Also, I'll note that workshops are more immediate, not run through blog comments and RSS. Now, does that mean you should somehow conspire to group folks by geography? Well, no, but it might make a BIG difference if a group had to meet by Skype or video conference on a regular basis, for "face-to-face" conversation at faster-than-typing speeds.<br/><br/>Finally--and I can speak to this from direct experience (and it will spawn a thread, I bet)--there are two general classes of feedback solicitation: blind and guided. In blind feedback situations, the readers are given the text and comment away after reading. In guided feedback, the readers are provided with a sort of precis or summary of the author's intent, be it thematic, tonal, formal, whatever (and games can have all those and more--with "fun factor" being high on the list). I found that I tend to prefer the latter, with knowledgeable and talented readers, because I tend to know where I'm heading in a work and I want others to help me on that path, not spin and gyre with advice about how to make the work head down the path they THOUGHT it was going. In blind feedback, it is sometimes the case that all the feedback tells you is, "Damn, I REALLY got off on the wrong foot and this person's telling me how to make a horror game out of my noir game!" or similar. However, with a very diverse feedback group--and maybe for games this is more desirable, as they are at least in part technical manuals--one can learn what is being totally misconstrued (and thus what must be heavily rewritten) versus what is "gotten" at first blush (providing clues as to where and how the piece is working best).<br/><br/>Could you leverage any of those techniques or practices?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
