I was very interested in playing it on the basis of that theme alone, but when I reached this part of the text I stopped reading and will probably not even bother to finish the text.<br/><br/>It seems immensely myopic to me. While I understand that the designers wanted to stress that Doubt is not "a game about coming out or fighting hetero-normativity but about partner-relationships" simply stating in the text "Doubt is about partner-relationships, and themes or facts that distract from that should be avoided" would have been a reasonable solution. Instead the game manages to alienate the entire LGBTQ community in a fell swoop, and seems to imply that involving alternate sexualities would ruin attempts to address the theme of partner-relationships.<br/><br/>For example, in what sense would Tom and Julia being out bisexuals harm the game? It's about two people growing apart, potentially about temptation and infidelity - so in what sense is that harmed by them being attracted to people of both genders?<br/><br/>Why is this a problem?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I got to play it with one of the writers, and I think that implications and context of what's meant by it are lost here.<br><br>Just a couple things that might matter here. Doubt is a translation. Both into English, and also into the cultural context of the US. I've no clue where the folks talking here are from, but these lines might sound very different in their mother tongue, and have a different feel to LBGTA folks in Sweden where it was written. <br><br>I seem to recall Tobias saying that rather than limiting the game to heterosexual pairings because of homophobia and generally wanting to avoid it. I believe that instead, there had been a slew of attention on alternative sexuality in games, and just limiting it to het couples was stepping out of the norm.  Another limitation is also that this is not a polyamory game--the characters are limited in the temptations to which they may fall: it is a different kind of story if both characters go off happy with someone else. Only one of the characters should accept a temptation, if any. <br><br>But the main reason that I recall was for organizational reasons.  Two of the players in the game play a raft of characters. In the game, you have a rapid-fire set of scenes, in which a player has to jump into character from 0 to 60 again and again. In order to simplify which characters a give person will have responsibility for, one of the four playeres takes all the male characters, one takes all of the female.  Note that there is no restriction on the gender of the players here. (As I recall). The  person playing the male characters has the role of tempting the player with the single female character. The female the male etc.  The game is not too complicated to play, once you've got a handle on the scene structure and the character organization, but the first time around it seems very intimidating, and is a bit of a challenge in play.  <br><br/>Given, that, however, I don't see any reason why the game couldn't be broadened out. After playing once, I can see players spinning gender with no loss for the game.  I imagine Tobias could include more explanations in a revised version, and suggest that as a variation. <br/><br/>best,<br/>Em                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180531/#Comment_180531" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T16:13:27+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  4:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given that, it sounds like this is far more "translation fail" than the failure of imagination I was perceiving.

And then there's the sort of presumption that LGBTQ people (with an emphasis on Q in this instance) are more open or inclined to polyamorous practice in their lives. As a bisexual myself, I know that I've had to explain to numerous people that I can be in a committed and trusting monogamous relationship <i>without</i> dividing by zero and thus negating all existence.<br><br>I guess what I'm saying is, there seems to be no huge reason for sexual orientation to be dictated in this game, and having it dictated sticks in my craw. Even a "for beginners we recommend that all relationships be heterosexual in nature in order to limit the number of possible pairings" would have sufficed. Instead there's the whole not wanting it to be about coming out or "fighting" hetero-normativity, which as egamad points out, is if nothing else a common but seriously misplaced assumption about queer fiction, or even just fiction with queers <i>in</i> it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180533/#Comment_180533" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T16:32:25+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  4:32PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If someone I knew cheated on their partner in a hetero-normative way, I'd tell them "Perhaps you should reconsider what your priorities are in regards to that relationship."<br/><br/>If someone I knew cheated on their partner in a homosexual affair when they previously expressed a heterosexual identity, I'd tell them "Hmm.

And then see how the game would read if every day you were bombarded with the sense that how you felt and perceived the world was wrong, only to pick up a roleplaying game that once again confirmed for you that you are not part of the surrounding culture and how they would like to once again pretend you don't actually exist.<br/><br/>Then swapping the wording might be an effective tool.<br/><br/>EDIT: Ugh, I think that sounds harsher than I intended.

To streamline its focus, the authors decided to limit the concept to a single heteronormative form. It's a game about monogamous, heterosexual doubts. Unless strictly prohibited, players seem to consistently emphasize the coming-out aspect potentially inherent in the material as soon as that comes up during play. That's the reason for the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast several other Jeepform games use a different approach. That's partially why I wrote a similar-looking scenario, A Bitter Aftertaste (http://www.jeepen.org/games/aftertaste/index.html), which draws from my own experiences and those of some friends, and includes potentially emerging themes such as a distrust due to bisexuality regardless of the characters' gender and orientation. Tobias' Gang Rape, in turn, does not really change by changes in orientation, but uses a default of male-on-female sexual violence because the game is also a political statement about the problems of the Swedish legal system as far as sexual violence is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing how open-minded the authors of Doubt actually are, I quite frankly find it rather offensive that people speak of alienation because they've written a strictly heterosexuality-grounded scenario. It's an artistic choice, not discrimination.

That's the reason for the rules.</blockquote>\nThe coming out thing is a legitimate concern, especially in this scenario. Having a character who is leaving a committed relationship because of their doubts about the relationship instead of their doubts about their sexuality is a very different theme to follow. So I can very much see why you need to narrow the focus away from "a coming out story." <br><br>Hell, I can very much see in my play group (which has a couple of gay members) the coming out story being used to defuse the emotionality of the scenario. Stupid, considering how harsh comings out are in reality, but for some folks it might allow a slide away from the personal emotional responsibility of ending a relationship by giving them an obvious handle, rather than having to dive into the sticky aspects of the real doubts. In that way, it would really be a disservice to make the relationship end because of a coming out, because its being used as a goat to slide around one theme, rather than being allowed to be a full and nuanced theme on its own. <br><br>Moreno also lays out the stage-direction reasons for the choice pretty well. If Tom is coming out (or Julia) then it causes some issues. <br><br>However, as someone already mentioned, most of these issues can be dealt with by simply making it not a coming out story. If its a committed homosexual relationship, then the same pressures and themes about the emotional uncertainties that undermine committed relationships still apply in full force. You do need a new way to divvy NPC roles at that point, however, as you won't have "male temptations" and "female temptations" you'll have one or the other. So maybe make it a three player scenario, or perhaps make it so that there are a small group of temptations, who are played by preset actors. <br><br>As to the discrimination angle... I don't think this is something the authors did that was horribly wrong. I think its something that the authors did as an artistic choice that falls into a social-structural area where discrimination, alienation, and accidental omission are the norm. I believe folks who say that it isn't the norm for the authors, and even can buy that it isn't the norm for the scene where the work originated. However, it is the norm for a lot of people, and when they read it they can be alienated despite the fact that the authors did not intend to alienate them. Those people are not wrong either. <br><br>So no, I don't think the authors did a terrible thing. I think they made a choice for reasons they felt were good. That doesn't mean others cannot criticize that choice, or that no one has a right to feel alienated or discriminated against by that choice. When we produce material for public consumption we have to make choices (or be so cowardly that we avoid any hot buttons), and we have to understand that sometimes the choices we make are going to be problematic for people. How we deal with that going forward is a choice too. <br><br>I also have to say, this discussion makes me want to ask the question, or write a game that addresses the question, "What is the difference between monogamous, heterosexual doubts and monogamous, homosexual doubts?" Its an interesting question to me, given the number of adult, long time out and open, committed, monogamous and married  queers I know.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180592/#Comment_180592" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T11:27:02+00:00" title="November 27, 2008 11:27AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't read the posts above yet. Sorry if I am duplicating what's been said but being the author and translator of the sentence in question, here goes:<br/><br/>The game was intended to be about being in a relationship and being tempted. However you want to do that is fine, with whatever kinds of sexuality you want. <br/><br/>Maybe my explanation could have been better than what it is. It is a quickly made translation from Swedish to English. It just so happens to be the case in the Scandinavian larp and freeform crowd that experimenting with alternate sexuality, queer issues, etc. has been the norm lately, at least around the time when the game was written in 2006. We have experimented with poly-amory, gender issues etc. and in the big art-house larp or 100 people that summer, there were, as far as I know, no heterosexual relationships at all, as a result of organisers letting the players choose sexual orientations themselves. I just saw before me people starting to do what was hot in the community at the time rather than working with the stuff I was trying to focus on. Plus, I didn't want to do what everybody else was doing. <br/><br/>I think playability of Doubt is completely irrespective of what kinds of sexuality setup you have and my intentions were of course not to alienate anyone. <br/><br/>I just wanted the possible temptations to be fewer to make the game more manageable given that I bundled a set of characters to use. I also didn't want the main characters to fight for the same person, although that could have been made into an orthogonal explicit rule. The game was written for a convention where people show up, get their characters and play in a 6-hour slot. The game's infrastructure should support getting up and running quickly, and so bundling characters and giving them a simple sexual orientation was part of that. <br/><br/>Sorry if I offended anyone. I'd happily take suggestions as to how to rewrite that section and update the PDF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180594/#Comment_180594" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-27T11:47:32+00:00" title="November 27, 2008 11:47AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>For those of you that read Swedish, here is the original formulation:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Tvivel \xe4r ett heterosexuellt arr</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Detta betyder att alla frestelser \xe4r heterosexuella.

Basically, they take turns playing against each other.

Maybe this could have been dealt with by including a "law of normality" for any kinds of sexual orientation. "Whatever it is, it is not a big deal in this game."
