Hostage! looks pretty cool, I may have to give that a shot.<br/><br/>Ben, I'm mostly percolating.  What I'm thinking about is an episodic/one shot kind of game where one player (sort of the "GM") preps a hostage taker (psychological makeup, motivations, demands).  The other players play the Crisis Response Team - negotiators, profilers, the SWAT team.  If you wanted to play more than one event, the players could rotate creating the personality of the hostage taker.<br/><br/>I think it will lean toward task resolution rather than conflict resolution, since nearly everyone will be on the same side.  However, since the game is mostly episodic, there won't be a huge need for character advancement or even effectiveness stats - the Crisis Response Team are all assumed to be very good at what they do.  (These may come into play more for the hostage taker, I guess.)<br/><br/>I'm also thinking that there may be some sort of randomized environmental factors that may crop up at various times during play.  It probably won't need to be a huge rule set, since most of the action will take place through talking.  Anyway, it's a bit different than Hostage! in that rather than having the GM play the negotiator, the players do the negotiating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
