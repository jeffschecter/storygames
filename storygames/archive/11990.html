The other guys have all played before, but not in probably a decade or so, and none of them felt confident enough to run a game.<br/><br/>Now, I own D&amp;D4E and also FantasyCraft (which for my money is a VASTLY superior continuation of 3E than Pathfinder) but I'm tending toward running something rules-light, so that the first session doesn't have to be all about teaching, and instead we can just throw together some characters and get adventuring. I also have a sinister motive of getting them into gaming enough that I can make them play Dogs in the Vineyard with me, since that's basically always my objective with a gaming group, so I prefer to start with something that's a little story-gamey, while still being able to say "yeah, this is D&amp;D".<br/><br/>My instinct is to run Red Box Hack, but I'm wondering if that might be too far from the D&amp;D they remember, so I come to you for suggestions.<br/><br/>My objectives, in order:<br/>1) Make sure everyone has fun;<br/>2) Get out of setup and teaching into basic play quickly;<br/>3) Make sure the former D&amp;Ders recognize elements of the game we are playing;<br/>4) Subtly lay the groundwork for story-gaming.<br/><br/>Thanks for any leads.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268090/#Comment_268090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T11:17:22+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 11:17AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a difficult set of parameters.<br/><br/>We are currently playing <a href="http://www.basicfantasy.org/main.html" rel="nofollow">Basic Fantasy Roleplaying</a>, which was Clinton's suggestion based on a desire for old skool flavor and open content.

My solution is to explicitly discard the notion of any specific rules-set, and rather just start with something ultra-simple and add detail later. I wrote about this a few years ago... ah, here: <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/10/24/primitive-dd/" rel="nofollow">Primitive D&amp;D</a>. The basic theory behind the idea of doing it yourself in play is that D&amp;D actually does not mandate most of its mechanics insofar as the game's design goes. 85% of the stuff you can actually ignore safely while playing, which leads us to the idea of just taking the mandatory bits and reconstructing the rest through play.<br/><br/>The simplest D&amp;D from my viewpoint at right this moment is the one where you give every player a simple character sheet and ask them to roll 3d6 in order for all the abilities. After that you let them choose their character classes among Fighter, Sage (Wizard/Mage, whatever), Adventurer (Thief/Rogue, whatever) and any other character classes you might fancy for your impromptu setting. If a player asks to play a Paladin or Ranger or some such, feel free to allow them. The effect of being a specific class is that you get a bonus equal to the character's level (+1 to begin with) for anything the character might choose to try that lands solidly within the purview of the character class in question, and +\xbd per level for anything that's only sort of related. Have the players equip their characters by listing anything reasonable on their character sheets; if they try something that seems suspect, feel free to ask for a Charisma check or whatever to see if they've managed to wheedle the piece from somewhere. Once the characters have stats, class and equipment, start the adventure. Whenever something is uncertain, call for a d20 + ability + class bonus check against a difficulty number; 20 is the default difficulty, 25 is challenging, 30 is really hard. Advance characters on levels whenever they achieve something remarkable, or track xp if you want. In combat have the players roll against 20 (or 25 for armored or insubstantial enemies, whatever) and take any excess outcome out of the target's Constitution. For a more complex (and more pleasurable to me) take have a "first degree success" (result 20-24) cause a "scratch", a -1 to all subsequent checks, a second degree success (25-29) a "injury" for -5 and a third degree (30+) success immediate death (Constitution saves); apply those penalties to both attack checks and the defense score of 20 when the opponent attacks, so that you have a steep death spiral that keeps combats short.<br/><br/>The above one paragraph has basically everything you need to begin with. The rest depends on your own tastes and the group's willingness to entertain complexity - note that I explicitly don't have rules for encumbrance, hit points, effect of weapons on fighting, magic, saving rolls or other such downers; those'll come only if you need them. For instance, you might complexify the character classes and include traditional D&amp;D ideas by giving each character a trait per level out of a prepared GM store of neat ideas. The GM picks a trait when the character levels based on what seems appropriate to the character and his class, but the player can deny the choice and seek teachers to learn something else, instead. In chargen the same thing: the GM picks, but if you don't like it, you can start the game without a trait, and it's the GM's job to include opportunities for learning something else into the adventure. Examples of what I mean by "trait":<br/><br/><b>Fighter:</b> Gain hitpoints. Unlike everybody else, this character gets d6 hitpoints at the beginning of any combat. The player can spend the hitpoints to lower opposing combat check results on a 1:1 basis to avoid injury. <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/about-the-dd-combat-system/" rel="nofollow">The hitpoints are rerolled for each combat</a>, and the character gets d6 per fighter level.<br/><b>Fighter:</b> The character gets to attack several times per combat against lesser foes. Specifically, he gets to distribute 1+[fighter level] of attack levels against targets so that each target takes 1+[their fighter level] attack levels. For example, a 3rd level fighter could thus attack four civilians or two 1st level fighters at once. A 5th level fighter could attack one 2nd level and one 1st level fighter. If the math starts to annoy, let the GM eyeball this.<br/><br/><b>Sage:</b> Know spell. The character knows a specific magical spell described by the GM. Casting it takes time, resources and appropriate conditions, but is not otherwise limited. The spells are primarily defined in real descriptive terms; their effects are adjudicated into rules mechanics at the moment of use by the GM, not in advance by the rules text.<br/><b>Sage:</b> Memorize spells. The character can bind a spell into his head so that it can be released later at a moment's notice, even in combat, the way D&amp;D magic works. He gets <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/vancian-magic/" rel="nofollow">one extra memory slot per sage level</a>. Any ritual requirements have to be fulfilled at the time of memorization. The character needs to know the spells to be memorized, or needs to have their master or some such NPC perform the magic to be memorized.<br/><br/><b>Adventurer:</b> Know a skill. The character masters a specific skill appropriate to their background. The player gets to roll Xd20 in Ability checks and pick the highest result, where X is equal to the character's adventurer level. If this is too strong, perhaps have the rolls be sequential instead of simultaneous, or have the player arrange multiple skills into a priority list, with only the most important one getting the full bonus.<br/><b>Adventurer:</b> Be cool. The character gets to take 10 instead of rolling in a one roll per scene. Whether success or fail, the character will look cool doing it.<br/><br/>As can be seen, fighters are bad-ass in my simple D&amp;D, while wizards need to choose between knowing a spell and being able to memorize it on the first level. I'm evil like that, but it's really up to you to decide what you want as the GM.<br/><br/>More importantly, the above fast-and-loose system wins over any of the usual suspects for me because it does not require the players to pre-learn anything, and it leaves the GM with a full range of tools in developing the system to whatever direction seems necessary in play. Furthermore, I like the math and the mechanical aesthetics of the above. Perhaps the most important property here, however, is the fact that the above system is not prescriptive of the relationship between the fiction and mechanics; the GM can adjudicate and adjust as necessary in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268110/#Comment_268110" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T12:21:11+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 12:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty much brilliant Eero and really about all I'd want from D&amp;D.;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268114/#Comment_268114" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T12:25:09+00:00" title="April 21, 2010 12:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Non self serving me says go with Red Box Hack; it is fast, easy and leaves a bit of a story game feel. <br/>Self serving me says <a href="koboldenterprise.com" rel="nofollow">Microlite20</a> or one of its many hacks!

They are friends and coworkers of my neighbour.<br/><br/>Me, I'm pretty easy to please. I like my fantasy adventure to be just-slightly-over-the-top. I like heroes to be mortal, but more awesome than normal people. Conan-level, I guess. I generally prefer to play games where the rules help build fiction, but I can't deny I love the simple "I bash the orc in the head with my mace! 3 damage!" style of play.<br/><br/>All that said, these are all going to be guys in their late-20s or early-30s that played D&amp;D in or university and nor much since. I'm going to guess that they remember the fun parts of pretending to fight trolls and discover treasure, without recalling much of the intricacy of dice-rolling and chart-referencing. So what I want to bring to the table is something that will remind them of the good stuff they remember from the old days, reintroduce them to the hobby, and have a bit of leeway for us to go off-the-rails and react to what they find fun as we play.

Even so, W&amp;W doesn't have absolutely everything that is in Advanced Wizard, so if you have access to that, you may want to use that for the "holes".
