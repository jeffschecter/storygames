Almost everything else about how they work is inferior to a forum run on proper forum software. For example, there are very few formatting options on posts, and even fewer on comments. You can't link to individual comments, so if you think a comment is particularly noteworthy, you can't reference it easily. You're only allowed to stick one post to the top. There is a search button, but it's inferior to what a search engine can turn up from a forum.

If you click on "Communities" then click on the Community you want, there is a box on the left - below the "Join" or "Member" button, but above the different categories in the community - that you can type a search term into.\n<blockquote><br/>Is there any good way to reference that kind of thing later, other than bookmarking the post manually?</blockquote>\nWell, you can use Collections to...er...collect posts.

A forum can conglomerate all useful information into a resource, but any kind of social media relies on daily posting, so it benefits if people have to post again and again and again, even if it's the same topic which keeps coming up over and over.<br/><br/>One thing I really like about forums is that I can always find information I need, whether it's current or not. For instance, let's say I'm really interested in "scene framing". I can come in here every day and quickly look through to see if there are any threads about "scene framing". I'm unlikely to miss any. If I am away for two weeks, I'll miss some, but the forum knows which threads I've read, so I can come by and look through all the posts which have arrived since I left, and read the relevant ones.<br/><br/>Is there any way to do something like this on G+? I can't really see one. If I want to make sure I don't miss any posts about a topic, I don't really have much choice except to constantly stay logged in and watch like a hawk, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457213/#Comment_457213" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T19:17:39+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  7:17PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2016 7:19PM by Airk.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could just...look at the community and scroll back two weeks?

But there's no way to do that more generally, is there? I *think* your advice only applies to Communities themselves.<br/><br/>(In a sense, it seems like the G+ creation of Communities breaks the general guiding principle which made G+ different from Facebook - that the post was the atomic unit, not it's location - like someone's Facebook wall or group. They do seem more manageable than free-floating posts, though.)<br/><br/>The reason it's easier on forums, though, is because of the visual layout (you can see everything at once, navigate by pages, and see activity at a glance - e.g. a thread receiving more replies appearing near the top, etc), because all threads have titles, which can give you a lot of information in a short time, and because the forum quite easily tracks what you have already read and what you have not.<br/><br/>If I know there was a post two weeks ago, I can, for instance, click on "page two" of the forum and quickly skim through topic titles of threads I haven't read. Is there any easy way to see, "Hey, what threads did I miss two weeks ago?"<br/><br/>Sometimes I hear about a conversation after the fact, and finding it seems... pretty tricky. (e.g. I'm looking at a two-month old e-mail, and it's someone saying, "Hey, did you see the conversation going on right now about AW on Story Games? It's relevant to your current game design.")<br/><br/>Thanks for the advice.

It is however about the only forum left where you can discuss RPG design in any meaningful way, so I'm willing to accept the frustration, but that might not be the case for others.\n<blockquote>Personally, the only advantage I've found with G+ communities is that they can leverage the user base that already is in G+ and that they allow voting (marginal benefit). Almost everything else about how they work is inferior to a forum run on proper forum software. For example, there are very few formatting options on posts, and even fewer on comments. You can't link to individual comments, so if you think a comment is particularly noteworthy, you can't reference it easily. You're only allowed to stick one post to the top. There is a search button, but it's inferior to what a search engine can turn up from a forum. In the new google+, the about page is now hidden and that sucks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Social media doesn't want to make it easy to keep past discussions available. It absolutely needs you to lose track of what was said eventually, because it relies entirely on a stream of new users who must not be made to feel as if they are joining a conversation which has already been going on without them. There's no good way to bookmark g+ conversations, Facebook posts, or even tweets other than locally. Searching any of these three platforms is equally a waste of time. "If you want to say something, why search to find out if it's been said before, a hundred thousand times before, it doesn't matter; what matters is if YOU say it RIGHT NOW!" Death and decrepitude are inevitable.</blockquote>\nAll true.<br/><br/>In addition social networks encourage you to address <i>people</i> rather than <i>ideas</i> in ways that often end up antagonistic. For example, on Twitter you literally talk AT people rather than TO them, and that loss of intimacy results in a lot of defensiveness and hostility. And G+'s, Facebook's, and Kickstarter's lack of quoting capability make it difficult to specify the remark you're commenting on (which makes long threads hard to follow) but very easy to specify the <i>person</i>. And I don't foresee this improving as all three networks have only <i>removed</i> useful features in the past.\n<blockquote>I think people are overstating the case for how hard it is to find this stuff.</blockquote>\nThe <i>hell</i> we are.<br/><br/>I once spent an hour looking for a comment I made on a private Facebook group before I gave up.

I subscribe to a lot of things and set them to post to my home stream, where I enjoy a constant barrage of diverse material.  On the home page, posts with new comments will get a boost upward, <i>but not continually,</i> and I think there's a diminishing value on the rank boost per comment over time.  I'm sure it's even more complex than that.  Anyway, my home stream is a giant stream of very diverse stuff.<br/><br/>When it comes to notifications, however, I'm more strict.  I only receive email notifications on my own threads and when I'm tagged.  When I hit G+, the first thing I do is click the little red bell icon to scan what's been posted lately (in those places I care to get notifications from).  Once I've gone through that list, I turn my attention to the home stream and begin scrolling.  I don't actually hop out to Communities very often; I tend to comment right there from my stream.<br/><br/>By going directly to Community and Collection pages and clicking the little gear icons, you can turn notifications on or off, and also change their frequency settings to low, medium or high.  So I do that.  If you set them low you will miss some stuff.  And you can set what you get email notifications for under your home menu "Settings".<br/><br/>I actually do have a Circle with just me in it.  Two, in fact.  These are useful for things you will need later, but keep it very focused or it will just become another slushpile.  I also have a Collection with just me in it.  I'm testing to see which is better, and what the difference is.<br/><br/>One way to organize your own public posts so you can find them later on G+ is by using <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23hashtags&amp;Mode=like">#hashtags</a>.  With some people it has become the primary means of post organization, although it's less popular there than it is on Twitter.  Hashtags can be searched, but like any search this can pull in false positives if you use common words, so you want to make your organizational hastags unique, usually by <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23UsingCamelCase&amp;Mode=like">#UsingCamelCase</a> and stringing several words together.<br/><br/>It is odd that Google (of all companies) has such shitty search features on their social network.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457312/#Comment_457312" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-20T17:51:31+00:00" title="October 20, 2016  5:51PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2017 5:29AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Here are some things you, hamstrung by your inability to re-architect the platform,  can still do to make this place better:<br/><br/>Approach interactions by reading charitably, having good humor, and being kind.<br/>Author interesting posts about things that are both on-topic and personally useful.<br/>Engage thoughtfully and respectfully with others and add knowledge and value to their posts.</blockquote>\nBut I already <i>do</i> that, so it's not something I can do <i>in addition</i> to make things <i>better</i>.

I personally don't want to discuss politics or too much philosophy, my  goal is to learn about gaming and to learn about design from the best minds out there; (I get to talk to people like Jason Morningstar and Ben Robbins  on these mediums, and pick their brains, and I consider that a huge privilege). Now if this involves a little bit of those elements that's fine, but I find overly indulging in them distracting from my goals of becoming a better game designer and better gamer overall.  Again, I'm not taking anything away from what your interests are or trying to demean them in anyway; and you may be wondering why I'm even engaging with you on this topic being that our goals maybe somewhat disparate. But I just want to emphasize, that I'm looking for mediums that will best help me to become a better game designer and <br/>learn from the best minds I can.  So that is what I'm hoping for by posting this discussion. So if anybody can help me in that regard; especially, by getting better at navigating at Google plus I would very much appreciate it :-) and I really do appreciate Jason's offer to bring us into his circle. Again, not to take anything from you or your <br/>discussion or derail your exchange :-) I just wanted to make sure that that didn't get lost in the mix. I hope I don't come off rude as that is not my intention. I try very hard to be cordial and to act with good act with good-will, but like everyone sometimes I mess up, so if I messed up let me <br/>know. Anyway, thanks :-)<br/><br/>Edit: you know the more I think about it, I think this is your goal also. I think you're frustrated with the status quo and you want to change things for the better, as you perceive the better to be. Maybe I just haven't been at it so long so I'm not as frustrated and I'm trying to be practical rather than making a big change.

Forums are a legacy of Web 1.0.  What we typically think of as "social media" or "social networks" are a Web 2.0 phenomenon.  There are core differences in the way such systems are built and used, mostly dealing with ease of distribution and redistribution, the idea being that content could be added to the network or viewed from the network regardless of what page you were on.<br/><br/>It is perhaps ironic that although social media were built with networked distribution in mind, and although they possess APIs permitting all sorts of remote interaction with their content (which is what makes them Web 2.0), most people still go to facebook to read facebook posts, youtube to search for videos, etc.  The great decentralization heralded by Web 2.0 failed to happen when it comes to the giant social media networks.  Or rather, it only goes in one direction: people produce content in the center (and they mostly consume it there too), and then it gets pushed out in tiny chunks to other places.  This gives it an almost "broadcast" quality.

When posting a reply on G+ I am limited to a 3in width window on a 24in 1440p display. At least G+ expands the height as you type. Facebook and Kickstarter don't.<br/><br/>And that <i>will</i> affect what people contribute.\n<blockquote>Communities I have found useful on G+:</blockquote>\nFor example, G+ communities generate less content than forums. Most posts are links to content hosted <i>elsewhere</i>, ads, or 'dot subs'. It's a major problem, and why projects like Facebook at Work are even a thing. In short, these networks are not conducive for discussion or collaboration.\n<blockquote>Game Design<br/>1,387 members<br/><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107042382950579703613" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107042382950579703613</a></blockquote>\nIt tells me that I have one or more moderators blocked when I joined, and yet none of the people I blocked are even members, and the moderator list on the community shows no members. And if I can't see them listed because I have them blocked, then how do I know which members I have blocked can read my posts on that community?<br/><br/>And that <i>definitely</i> affects how likely I am to participate.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">@AnonAdderlan</a> <br/>Sarcasm, levity, and criticism are not lost on <i>just</i> social media. They are in fact very hard to do well on <i>any</i> internet, or computer platform. The plain and simple fact is that we humans rely on non-verbal, non-language cues to actually get what people are saying. Speaking only through text on any web platform has to be carefully crafted or it easily gets misinterpreted. So its no surprise that Mod's of these communities strictly enforce politeness and thoughtfulness. Even if some of the nuance is lost. <br/><br/>I find it a little ridiculous to imply there is some perfect system out there that we're all missing that will fix what amounts to the sum total of human evolved language. </blockquote>\nBut there is. It's called reading in good faith, not taking everything to heart, <i>and getting to know the community before jumping to conclusions</i>. Because what I'm seeing are communities which were doing just fine until some newb joins who doesn't get the joke. And I have yet to see a tight knit community which <i>doesn't</i> engage in some form of deprecating humor as a way of bonding.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457698/#Comment_457698" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-30T23:46:43+00:00" title="October 30, 2016 11:46PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2016 11:50PM by AsIf.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed.
