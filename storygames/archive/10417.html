The book, with the way it's designed to be read during play, is the most usable game text I have ever encountered. It creates instant system mastery. The only thing I wish was different is that the "how to write good triggers/ask good guiding questions" stuff were broken out onto a single redistributable page, or incorporated into the Reader's text with an optional mark somehow. The replay is very helpful; taking into account my play of Fiasco, and the way that the replay lowered the barrier to our first session, I am beginning to think that every game could benefit from one. The nice thing is that not everyone needs to read the Replay; even if only the facilitator does, he transmits what he learned to the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231759/#Comment_231759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T12:22:54+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 12:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been putting off reading anything past the first chapter because it seems to indicate that it should be read during play.

The "read during play" thing isn't an encouragement not to read the book, but rather a way to say not to worry if everyone in the group hasn't read it, since there's a way to teach the rules in play. The rules don't hide surprises or anything.<br/><br/>Ideally, at least one person at the table ought to have spent some time thinking about the Questionnaire to be used, about whether to use one of the alternate Facts and Reassurances documents, about how to help everyone with the Triggers and Guiding Questions, and so on.

No one picks them.  No one needs to give them a penny.  If no one gives them a penny then no one asks a second question.  You only give someone a penny if no one can afford their next question.  If you have to give someone a penny in this manner the person who volunteers gets to ask a second question.<br/><br/>2) You do keep asking for guidance until you are out of pennies.

Have you been taking the dope?</blockquote>\n"The drug works!"   (hee hee!)<br/><br/>I find the book to be quite well put together.  I am happy with the level of the how-tos.  It is my experience when you have a section on making good X elements, you end up poisoning the well a bit.  People, even creative people like gamers, are subject to affectation by suggestions like that and it can pull people away from groundbreaking developments that would have made with less examples to cleave to, as it were.  (The best example of what I mean might be writing oracles for IaWA.  The great examples in the book seem to many to create a template in people's heads that forces many to just vary those there in creating new ones.)<br/><br/>Back to the book.  The text is clear and I was not stopped by an ambiguities during reading the processional portion.  I did get good clarifications of game flow from the examples, where there may have been an issue between reading and play, but at no point in reading did I feel I needed to go back and do a retake on a section - even in the penny trading economy sections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233159/#Comment_233159" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T23:44:29+00:00" title="September 18, 2009 11:44PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>"The drug works!"

However the character sheet with it's 2, 3, and 4 circles for pennies had me and the group I was playing with use them to slot pennies into. When we had extra pennies, we put them into the space for the next question.  On the last question, it actually got pretty close that one player might not go. But it worked out. And the flow felt nice that way. But it was close enough that I was checking the book when I could to find out what happens when you don't have enough pennies.  I rather liked it, and I think it helped pacing, for individual travelers as well as the session as a whole.\n<blockquote>Both of these situations are covered in the example transcript in Chapter 4.</blockquote>\nWhich I have to say is supremely written.

This is the single most usefully layed out game I have. There are a couple of things I might have done differently, but they are all minor tweaks.<br/><br/>1) I'd have noted that its a game somewhere on the cover. I approached the book knowing what I was getting into, but what happens if someone unaware finds it in a book store.<br/>2) I'd have inserted a forward page noting again that its a game, and setting expectations<br/>3) I'd have placed the list of needed materials as the very first item so people didn't need to break their immersion to scavenge for them<br/><br/>Having said that the layout of this book is brilliant and it is <b>exceedingly </b>usable. One might even describe it as inspired.<br/><br/>Also, Jason asked about the readability of the pdf. Its not perfect, but because each section where it says something like "If a particular condition is met, jump now to a particular section" is linked in the pdf, using the pdf is exceedingly simple. An HTML document might work better, but the pdf proves surprisingly versatile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250164/#Comment_250164" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-09T09:06:29+00:00" title="January  9, 2010  9:06AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played the game straight from the book, without reading it first.

As I explain in that other thread, we too played without reading first and it went fine.<br/><br/>Now that I'm thinking of playing it again I wonder if the instructions on the memories being about the advice given on the questionnaires (Recall a pleasant memory) are too vague or even missing. We certainly missed connecting the advice to the memory preparation and then had hard time answering the questions after the memory. <br/><br/>But, all in all a really usable book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
