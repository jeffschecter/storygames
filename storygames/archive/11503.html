To me, it looks like just what the game design community needs.<br/><br/>Basically you pay a small monthly fee. Content creators can put a Flattr button next to their content. If you like it, you click. At the end of the month, your $1 or $5 or whatever gets divided up between everyone whose content you Flattr'd.<br/><br/>Why I like this idea is that I think I fills a real need for a better "free content" business model. I see dozens of things being sold on RPGnow that would probably be better as free products. They could reach a larger segment of their intended audience if they were free, but the creators could still see some reward for their work. I see content that's already free that I want to encourage and support, but can't because there's no simple path to it. And I think there's probably a lot of good content that could be created, but hasn't been because they potential creators don't see a way to get support for it.<br/><br/>I'm signed up for the Flattr beta. I don't know how good it's going to be, but I think it would be awesome if people started using it. Or maybe, even better, it's time we created a solution like this of our own!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256295/#Comment_256295" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T07:48:04+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  7:48AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Presumably part of the donation you make also goes to the people who own the site, yes?<br/><br/>I'm never quite sure about these business models.

Instead, most significant webcomics survive on merchandise sales (printed collections, t-shirts, etc.) related to a product that is ultimately free. Personally, I have much more confidence in the continued success of the "free + sales" model than I do in micropayments, for a number of reasons, mainly:<br/><br/>Micropayments require a substantial number of people to become involved before it becomes a legitimate business model; this critical mass you're talking about isn't just important, it's CRITICAL for it to work at all, partially because micropayment companies have to be successful enough to 1) survive and 2) earn the trust of potential users, but also because, without a substantial amount of interesting and valuable work available on the same micropayment service, there will not be any incentive for customers to get an account with that service.  This is why I've never done micropayments: there's never been enough reasons too.<br/><br/>However, with the "free + sales" model (sometimes just called the webcomics model), you take advantage of existing ways of doing business on the internet (i.e. selling stuff), so the middle men already exist, are already stable, and everyone already uses them.  More importantly, they don't take the form of subscription services so there's no long term commitment or need to put in a base amount of money.  You just buy stuff as you want it.  Plus, people are more likely to be willing to check stuff out if it's free, even if micropayments only cost them a few cents.  The problem isn't the cost, the problem is the time and energy commitment needed to set up a micropayment account in the first place.<br/><br/>That said, if there were ways to get over these barriers or a substantial community developed that was producing content for a given micropayment service, that would be great.  But I worry that the hurdles that stand in the way will continue to make that unlikely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256374/#Comment_256374" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T14:49:32+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  2:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jaywalt">@Jaywalt</a>: That's a good summary. I don't have much historical knowledge of micropayment solution or Webcomics, so it's helpful to me. I have a strong intuition that most or all of those objections can be overcome with the right approach.<br/><br/>I see micropayment as a non-exclusive enhancement of the free + sales model. I can see a lot of potential benefits on both sides.<br/><br/>On the consumer\u2019s side, I see an opportunity to further support the content you like. There's a further value in being part of a community of contributors. In the long run, there could be a significant improvement in the value of the free content available. <br/><br/>On the creators side there's the opening of another way to get paid for your work, which I think is always potentially good, but more than that, there's a more granular way to get paid by being paid less for smaller chunks of content.<br/><br/>And I think there's also a consumer-creator category where the biggest values are around being part of a community with a real interest in creating and rewarding really good content.<br/><br/>I don't think any of this excludes the current free and pay models that are being used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256380/#Comment_256380" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T15:03:53+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  3:03PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I realize that I haven't addressed adoption.

Although a lot of webcomics and similar sites have a PayPal donation button, it seems like this is most worthwhile when the donors get some kind of incentive/bonus above and beyond the usual free content, even if it's something very small. Lots of webcomics will give donors some kind of desktop wallpaper (often a pinup of some kind) for example (<a href="http://www.nekomiminodensetsu.com/" rel="nofollow">Caribbean Blue</a> has a digital swimsuit calendar with a ransom model a la Greg Stolze), and with <a href="http://www.neko-machi.com/" rel="nofollow">my webcomic</a> we're going to experiment with offering donors a very small bit of custom art to use as an avatar on forums and such (hopefully starting pretty soon).<br/><br/>To me the two main obstacles Flattr has are that (1) there doesn't appear to be a mechanism for providing an incentive to donate, and (2) its utility is directly dependent on both donors and content creators adopting it in significant numbers. (Why bother putting it on your site if no one's using it to donate?/Why bother signing up to donate with it if none of the sites you like have Flattr buttons set up?) If it works, it could snowball and become ubiquitous, but it could just as easily be a flop.<br/><br/>[1]Looking at the Wikipedia page on micropayments I see that PayPal defines micropayments as being less than US$12, which means that not a few RPG PDFs would qualify in their eyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256436/#Comment_256436" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T19:22:04+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  7:22PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see something like micro-patronage working out.
