I have not been able to put two sentances together for the past two weeks.<br/><br/>We had our first session last night.  For those who havn't been following the D&amp;D project I started you can learn more <a href="http://www.realityvault.net" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.  Look for the Wizard's campaign posts.<br/><br/>I was unhappy with the play.  It was a really important playtest.  It taught me a lot and specifically informed me about my own expectations and what I want out of this campaign.  And this was not it.<br/><br/>There was some really cool stuff going on and some of the players really took my directions to heart when I said "It's your responsibility to bring the fun to the table."<br/><br/>The roleplaying was a blast.  But it was not what I was looking for.  I have been trying to figure out what experience I am looking for and trying to put that to paper.  The only thing I have come up with is that I want a little more plot development.  The game is about advancement and making wizardly advancement interesting.  But I still think there is an assumtion of some sort of thing the PCs should get involved in.<br/><br/>Also the Scene Types I have tied to Locales are a little too opague.  I was unhappy that we were referring to them more than the names of the Locales.  I am thinking that instead of Scene Types (more on that later) I may go with a more PTA approach - advancement scenes and plot scenes.  This will ask the players are you trying to advance the plot or are you trying to advance your character.  Advancing the plot put the scene in the GMs hands where advancing the character puts the scene in the player's hands.<br/><br/>I also want to inspire more PCs in scenes.  I have the players interacting nicely as NPCs when it's not their turn but it still is two people at the table roleplaying while everyone else is doing something else.  It just didn't have the feel I am looking for in this game.<br/><br/>Any ideas are handy at this point please take a look at what we've created thus far and let me know if you think you have a better idea of what I am after here.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115526/#Comment_115526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T08:04:51+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  8:04AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2007 11:13AM by eruditus.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay so I realized I talked about what I didn't like but not what happened.<br/><br/>This is going to be brief but hopefully will be helpful and spur questions.<br/><br/>So we started with a rules discussion.  I talked about consequences to rolls and was met with blank stares.  The group was completely unwilling or frustrated to talk about such theory-based ideas.  I was trying to explain how much cooler it was that rolls caused complications and how my little chip system is going to work - I have not written about that yet but the short version is that I have Calamity Chips I get when they fail a roll and I can use them to make their lives more "interesting."  I tapered off the conversation when people were getting a little testy.  Not that they disagreed but they felt like it was all just going over their heads.<br/><br/>I had them complete their characters by making their starting Locales.  It took a little longer than I had hoped so I need to streamline this process.<br/><br/>More about the play a little later today.<br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115528/#Comment_115528" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T08:12:16+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  8:12AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/><br/>Is it possible that they didn't want to talk about RPG theory but just wanted to play?<br/><br/>'Cause that'd probably leave me with a quite blank look too.<br/><br/>I have found this stuff is best done through careful game set up, mechanics that back up the premise and showing by example in play, rather than sitting down and having one person explain the theory behind something.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115585/#Comment_115585" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T11:21:30+00:00" title="December 20, 2007 11:21AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, too much too late.  I have a few players that are critical of the process but willing to give it a try so I was interested in giveing them a "under the hood" look at why we're doing certain things.  It was lost on them and I realized some of them were just striving for something a little more familiar.<br/><br/>It's that middle-ground I am trying to find.  I am okay if through this process I discover it doesn't exists and certain play styles are too divergent but at least I will have tried <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In the future I will have those discussions at their prompting.  If they ask why or not liking a certain element of the game then I'll talk about that stuff but I just don't think it's productive (read: fun) to follow my own thought process out loud with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115594/#Comment_115594" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T11:34:17+00:00" title="December 20, 2007 11:34AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued AP)...<br/><br/>After creating Locales we jumped right in.  I had two players that had done playtests before this so they kinda jumped right in and included other players in the mix as NPCs.<br/><br/>It was clear that one or two players were way more into the role-playing than the others so they were the ones that got picked.<br/><br/>We played out two Locales a person (5 players).  With the added Locale creation we could have done three which was a nice pacing living out the day to day lives of these Wizards (each day you can visit three local places).  <br/><br/>Names were slow to come by as NPCs were created on the fly.  Everyone (but one) did a round of Research.  Only one person failed their research and we did a second round.  That round was a little more varied alhtough Exploration dominated.  It seemed a little too canned.  There was some good character development and the information was spot on in how it gets developed but I can't say it was fun or anywhere near the play experience I am striving for.<br/><br/>We had a good range of gamers from hardcore story gamers to really conservative traditional gamers.  Visiting Locales was a little clunky as people learned what was going on and I liked what they produced but I've come to realize that it's not what I am looking for.  This setup would completely work with a group of SG folk but that is not necessarily my target audience.<br/><br/>There were peaks and valleys in the play and there were a certain few players for whom the play came to a grinding halt against the play-style learning curve.  I have no doubt that a few more games like this and they would have picked it all up just fine and it would have probably been a descent story game but it wouldn't be D&amp;D.  <br/><br/>The next game is in a week so I am going to rethink it a bit.  More on that on Saturday.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
