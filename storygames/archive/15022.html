We wrapped up the Palette first thing, since we left off the previous week while creating it.<br/><br/>It was growing clear since last week that there was a divergence in the kind of play we wanted. Two of the players, Monster Man and I, were against the idea of supernatural elements in our post-apocalyptic history. Two others, Asdee and WizMasia, wanted more supernatural stuff like superpowers, or at least the option to bring them in later on. The fifth player, Kraang, was more in the latter camp.<br/><br/>When I asked to have "magic that actually works" banned from the game (placebo/psychological/scientific effects would be fine), this met with little resistance. However, when I realized that some players thought magic and superpowers were not the same thing, I moved to ban all supernatural powers and touched off a bit of discussion between our two camps. We shared our concerns; Monster Man and I feared that superpowered characters might take over the game, negating the need for human effort and cooperation in rebuilding the world, while Asdee and Wizmasia felt the element would provide more freedom and color to the game.<br/><br/>I realized as I talked about my fears that this was an issue of trust more than anything. Because I didn't have control over what others would be adding during the game, I wanted to make sure at the prep stage that it wouldn't go in directions that I felt were disruptive. I wasn't trusting other players, particularly the ones who had a different aesthetic than I did, to contribute to an enjoyable story. On the other hand, if I wanted full control over the story I should be writing fiction (which I also do) rather than playing story games. And who could say that having superpowers wouldn't make for a fun post-apocalypse game? If I wanted to focus on the struggles of ordinary folk I had the freedom to do so.<br/><br/>Still, sharing the reasons behind our opinions proved productive. Asdee and Wizmasia agreed that it would be lame to have superheroes show up and solve everything, so on his turn Monster Man added "characters who can solve social ills on their own" to the No list, which we passed without opposition. So even if there were some superpowered individuals, they would still need to band together with others to solve the big problems, which was fine by me.<br/><br/>The first round went really well. We fleshed out more of the apocalypse, with biochemical warfare (we banned nuclear warfare) leading to mass deaths and a rather understandable fundamentalist anti-technology religion coming to power in the aftermath, all during the starting period called "The Burning Times." The next period is one of total chaos which I named "War of All Against All," and then comes a period of purifying the environment and human thought, and finally the establishment of the first stable polity. This last is our tentative ending period--tentative, because we agreed we could decide on a new, later ending period if we wanted to expand the game.<br/><br/>To me, the way play went was the answer to the question of trust--because other players, once given the power to add things freely to the game, took the awesome of the collective idea and amped it up to the Nth degree. The unpredictable and unpredicted elements, in turn, jogged creativity in other players, taking the whole thing in directions no one foresaw.<br/><br/>For instance, I vaguely assumed at the outset that the apocalypse period was called the Burning Times because it was some kind of conventional warfare that brought about the end of civilization, since nuclear warfare was banned by the group. (So were zombies.) Now the introduction of biological warfare by Monster Man brings up entirely new possibilities, especially combined with the War of All Against All period that I added. I have a pretty awesome idea for a Scene tying all this together, which may or may not happen depending on the Focus and what other players add before me. But that's fine; I'm sure it'll be fun even if things don't go as I planned. It may require trust in elements beyond my control and it may be less safe, but I think I like it this way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341426/#Comment_341426" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-02T15:10:11+00:00" title="September  2, 2011  3:10PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You are dead on about trust.<br/><br/>Are you breaking new ground for yourself here?

I've been playing story games for a few years, but Microscope has been more difficult for me than most. The others I've played had a GM (Primetime Adventures, In a Wicked Age, Dogs in the Vineyard) or had genre and/or procedural limits to play (Fiasco, Polaris, Grey Ranks). A play-by-wiki rule I played several times called Revisionist History didn't have GM or genre/procedural limits, but everything in the fiction was subject to challenge. Microscope was the first game I played that didn't have any of those limits (or weakened them), and I was struggling with the amount of freedom and the possibilities for abuse it offered. Maybe I'm still struggling, but I recognize the problem and think I've learned to let go a little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341775/#Comment_341775" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T16:56:50+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  4:56PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's beautiful, Jee.
