I'm not made of money (still a student), so I want to efficiently acquire and read the best of what I've missed.<br/><br/>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come up with the best 9 games from 2002-2011 and list them in the order that they should be read to get the most out of them and cover the most gaming ground (that's right, its OK to include the best of coming soon).<br/><br/>Ready, set, go!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285629/#Comment_285629" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T18:00:05+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  6:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshal,<br/><br/>Welcome back!<br/><br/>I will take up your challenge when I have a moment.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285630/#Comment_285630" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T18:15:58+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  6:15PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2010 6:17PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might start by checking out the <a href="http://www.rpg-awards.com/" rel="nofollow">Indie RPG Awards</a>, which date back to 2002.<br/><br/>2002: InSpectres, Dust Devils, Riddle of Steel<br/>2003: My Life with Master<br/>2004: Dogs in the Vineyard, Primetime Adventures, The Shadow of Yesterday, Nine Worlds<br/>2005: Polaris, The Mountain Witch, Breaking the Ice, Bacchanal<br/>2006: Spirit of the Century, Lacuna, Burning Empires, Don't Rest Your Head, Shock:, The Shab Al-Hiri Roach, 1001 Nights<br/>2007: Grey Ranks, Beast Hunters, Bliss Stage, Dirty Secrets<br/>2008: Mouse Guard, 3:16, Zombie Cinema, In a Wicked Age, A Flower for Mara<br/>2009: Kagematsu, Fiasco, Diaspora, Montsegur 1244, A Penny for My Thoughts, Lady Blackbird<br/>2010: Apocalypse World, Freemarket, Blowback, etc.<br/><br/>Also, It's Complicated and Mist-Robed Gate and Carry should be in there somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285637/#Comment_285637" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T19:01:10+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  7:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, what kinds of games do you like in general?

For now, at least, I reading good game books will have to suffice.  I do plan to try and find a Boston Con at some point and ask for a day to go play, guilt-free, from my wife sometime in the next year though.  That's one reason I was drawn to the books that I did buy - they're all really good reads (unlike many mainstream RPG books/supplements that are essentially lists of descriptions and modifiers).<br/><br/>[edit] Story Games Boston, who knew! They actually meet in the store that I frequent for my board/RPG purchases (now that Your Move Games is closed).

I mostly play with friends, and - to the extent that those friends are into traditional/classical games - I try to suggest other stuff that I like. <br/><br/>Just in the last year or so I started to attend local mini-cons and indie game nights. It's been great! Everyone I've met and played with has been nice, and its' really fun to play games with other people who are into them and already know them, so I'm not always the teacher and ringleader. It doesn't *replace* gaming with friends and small groups, but it really adds to it. Plus you meet people who might end up in your next regular group.<br/><br/>So if you can swing it, I second the suggestion to get out and play some games with Story Games Boston, or whoever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285777/#Comment_285777" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T09:18:43+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  9:18AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I have a ton of love for Lady Blackbird, and I strongly recommend it as an "intermediate" game, but it's totally not one to put on your "play this right the fuck now" list if you've been out of the hobby for that long.<br/><br/>As someone who's never read TSOY or the other influences of Lady Blackbird, the extremely-beautiful PDF came off like it was in a different language to me.

I can't tell you which games are capital-I Important. I can tell you which games affected me, made me a better player/GM, and a more thoughtful person. I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but here goes.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard:</b> I have never played a Dog that I liked. I never "had fun." I was deeply satisfied and a little uneasy about my experience. I'd never played a game that hit me that way before in my life.<br/><br/><b>Polaris:</b> The ritual language and shared GM responsibility was a real revelation for me.<br/><br/><b>Bliss Stage:</b> By the author of Polaris, the mechanized relationships in this game changed the way I think about character interaction, and has informed everything else I have ever thought about game design.<br/><br/><b>Annalise:</b> This made me love a genre (vampire/horror) I was never really interested in. The distributed GM responsibility you get with Polaris, turned up to 11 with secrets and intrigue and one of the most clever dice mechanics ever thought of.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World:</b> I've been playing this game since late summer of 2008, in every incarnation, and I own two copies of it. (Or is it three?) This is, quite simply, the best game I've ever played in my entire life. It started out that way, in rough playtest, and then it got better.<br/><br/><b>Mist-Robed Gate:</b> The most visceral gaming experiences of my life have been MRG. And it emulates the genre (wuxia, house-of-flying-daggers-style blood opera) so, so beautifully. It's a delicate, nuanced, amazing game. I love love LOVE it.<br/><br/><b>S/lay w/me:</b> When I sat down to play this with Ron "Sorcerer" Edwards, I blushingly admitted I'd never played one of his games before, even though he's the Godfather of indie RPGs. Ron just beamed. "Good! This is the Ron Edwards game you should start with." I agree. It just.. It's hard to explain. It's all of the lessons of indie RPGs distilled down to its very essence. Learning S/lay felt less like learning a new game and more like remembering how to play a game I'd forgotten. It's a masterwork.<br/><br/>The last two slots are left for games that I have yet to play, and therefore, have yet to blow my mind. But I know they're out there, somewhere, waiting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285815/#Comment_285815" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T10:36:10+00:00" title="August 12, 2010 10:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the comments thus far.

So joining the mailing list is pretty much essential, because if it's one of those weeks where someone says, "I got nothin' to pitch" and there's a chorus of "me neither"s, then everyone stays home. <br/><br/>It tends to pick up in the fall, because of college students returning and fewer clement weather distractions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288306/#Comment_288306" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T10:42:05+00:00" title="August 23, 2010 10:42AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Further update:<br/>Ok, so my quest to get back into RPGs is going really well.  I'm still waiting on my book orders (.pdfs are nice, but I really need a print copy to pore over), they should be in this week.  <br/><br/>I've joined a PBEM of Apocalypse World and am absolutely loving it thus far - the world being created is way cool!  AW has jumped to the top of my must purchase list and will get ordered about 10 minutes after I get my next paycheck.  <br/><br/>I've also joined a PBF of Agon over at RPG Geek.  I'm enjoying it as well, though it is still in the character generation/prelude stage.  <br/><br/>Though I miss the traditional table-top style of play, I'm finding that there is a lot to be said for the more descriptive and deliberate nature of online play.  In games where players have a lot of input on the game, having time to add more detail really makes for vivid settings.  I also find that having it all written out makes it easier to look back and draw in past descriptions and facts, taunting each other with details that beg to be acted upon.  Lastly, I love that I can fit two games into my busy schedule without bartering with the wife for enough time to meet up in person to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
