The AW book kind of tells us it's a dusty place filled with horrible people, little water, etc. I want to see how much I can change the tone by making it a verdant, beautiful, dangerous post-apocalypse.<br/><br/>I'm thinking huge, mutated carnivorous tress. Hardholds that use complicated hook and pully systems to move from branch to branch at a snail's pace. I think making people think more about a hard existence in a dangerous environment instead of a biker wasteland will make a huge difference in the tone people pick up. Make the environment more actively an enemy. At one point in AW Vincent mentions dogs with boney eyelids, take that and run with it. Make all the people be relateable by giving a clear outside enemy.<br/><br/>(This is probably all wrapped up in the dusty dry Southwestern US being home for me and currently living in the verdant Northwest, but whatever, maybe it'll work for others.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288799/#Comment_288799" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T11:59:48+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 11:59AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you can have fundamental scarcity in a productive environment if you mix it with a generous dollop of ignorance.

Or nixes compassion? That would probably make it easier to provide specific advice.<br/><br/>I'm trying not to be rhetorical, because of course my immediate response really is 'just run the game as-written, and then don't add any skin-eating.' You're the MC, you have near-total control over the colour and tone of the game -- whenever something bad happens to the PCs, you get to decide what that means. When the rules stipulate that somebody's gang is 'savage' and a roll tells you that their savagery has activated -- as MC, you decide what savage looks like. If you never decide that it looks like skin-eating, then you're pretty much golden in terms of avoiding that level of depravity. Maybe it just means they start fist fights, or kill a guy, or kidnap somebody with soft skin.<br/><br/>I mean, as long as you yourself have a fairly consistent idea of the tone -- or even just a kind of basic, default intuitive level of 'what badness looks like' -- you are unlikely to accidentally end up with a game that differs from that. In fact, when I MC, I usually have to <i>remind myself</i> that this is <i>the fucking Apocalypse, already</i>, because my own impulse is always to underplay everything, to make these little subtle gestures of savagery, instead of just up and up mutilating somebody and sticking their body on a flagpole. Our first campaign (which I did not run) had some serious, life-sucks violence, but almost no gonzo action cannibal mutilation style savagery.<br/><br/>In terms of specific advice, how you build your Fronts and how you imagine the different types of Threats might be important -- just because things are called 'Grotesques' doesn't mean they have to be shambling mounds of flesh, etc. But I think you probably get that already. But I guess I can only repeat that there's not a lot of skin-eating built into the game, so unless you're worried about putting it there by accident you'll probably be fine.<br/><br/>As for the players having a positive impact in the world, that's really up to the players. They don't need your help, they just need you to acknowledge that their actions matter. The dice and the complicated situations and the whole Apocalypse thing should make it hard enough to be compassionate -- but again, you will be the one deciding how and when and how hard they get kicked in the sack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288803/#Comment_288803" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T12:02:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 12:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 12:06PM by DWeird.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell this to the players, so they know in advance and make characters accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also -- and I haven't done this, so try out at your own risk -- change the fundamental scarcities of the game into something less carnal, more emotional.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of straightly bad stuff like "Envy", "Ignorance", "Hunger", you could try framing your fronts in terms of too little or too much of a respectable quality...

Get the tone you want to see on the table up-front, as that's something that's important to you.<br><br>After that, it's a question of what moves you choose and how you interpret them.  For instance, when a character gets a soft hit on a "do something under fire" move, the MC gets to offer a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.  What qualifies as worse, hard, or ugly is a function of the tone.  Also, "badness" -- very tone-dependent.  <br><br>Remember that you get to write custom moves.

Is it tales of small victories in the face of desperation? Is it tales of discovery and redemption with the possibility of meaningful rebirth?<br/><br/>I think a lot of that will come through how you build out your Fronts. I'd make good and sure that none of your Fronts' dark agendas are especially dark, for one. Like I've got a Front in which the local warlord rules all of NorCal with an iron fist after crushing her enemies in the surrounding towns. So like the PG-13 version of that might be "the warlord arranges trade relations and mutual protection agreements with the surrounding towns." Not especially dark, and leaning dangerously toward establishing a status quo (of which there are none in AW!), and I'm...not sure where the drama would come from in that case.<br/><br/>Probably you'd need to dial down just how ugly an ugly choice might be -- so rather than "you can get a tankful of gas but that schoolbus of kids you're driving are gonna get machinegunned", you might go "you can get a tankful of gas but the kids in that school bus are going to get antsy and start running around out of control." And then you'd have to not escalate that too badly or too quickly. Maybe a kid falls down a well, or eats something he shouldn't.<br/><br/>I'm finding the very premise of de-darkening AW so difficult to address with a straight face that I almost can't come up with examples that aren't comically absurd, or devoid of meaningful conflict. I'm a huge PA genre nut and run a pretty grim game of it here myself. It's hard to envision how best to leverage the tools the game gives you, since most of the "rules" exist to load the GM with all sorts of nasty ammo to which the players must react. It's a reactive game, IMO, reflective of the base desperation of the situation.<br/><br/>Tough question now that I'm sitting here doodling on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288810/#Comment_288810" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T12:10:00+00:00" title="August 25, 2010 12:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 12:41PM by Teataine.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my experience running the game, listening to Vincent and John and reading APs (imho, ymmv):<br/>The game is geared towards <b>characters having a positive impact on the world</b>, it's right there in the system. It just makes it very difficult for them along the way. The characters are there fighting for a better tomorrow. They're a beacon of light in a dark, dark world. This doesn't mean they can't be violent fuckups themselves, but ultimately it comes down to: realizing "we're the people that can fix this world" and dealing with that. At least that's my impression. As a MC, you need to be aware of two things in this context:<br/>1. you need to jump forward with human, named NPCs and make PC-NPC-PC triangles<br/>Meaning: give the PCs opportunities to get attached, have people to care and worry about, not nameless, faceless mooks to graze down (because goddamn can they kill tons of people if they get down to it, our Gunlugger's frag score was in the hundreds in a few sessions), something in the world that's worth saving, and something that threatens it. Relationships.<br/>2. you're looking at your NPCs through crosshairs<br/>Meaning: in the end, no matter how much the PCs are going to get kicked in the sack (because fuck, it's a harsh world), that's NOTHING compared to what happens to the NPCs. Every time you have a NPC in the scene you're just contempleting how to bury the fucker in the poisoned ground. You're a fan of the PCs but you're downright cruel to your NPCs. At a certain point I believe the PCs will realize that they're not out there to fight, kill and overthrow the NPCs (because that's actually damn easy), but to save them (which the Ungiven Future is all about). The only thing that can seriously oppose a PC is another PC. So...<br/><br/>(funny thing, I just told you to run the game as written)<br/><br/>I think the tone can be shifted quite a lot without impacting the mechanics too much. Kinda like the supernatural dial in Dogs y'know. But do be post-apocalyptic. I mean, I can't really imagine a cuddly post-apocalypse. So the brutality is inherent in the tone. Also remember that the PCs, as awesome as they can be and all the superpowers they get, are supposed to be real people.<br/><br/>So, that said, how much of the skin-eating would you like to remove exactly? Because, much like McCarthy's The Road, while there are cannibals along the road, and coughing up blood, and falling ash and hopeless darkness, in the end, there are people carrying the fire.

At a certain point I believe the PCs will realize that they're not out there to fight, kill and overthrow the NPCs (because that's actually damn easy), but to save them</blockquote>\nThis seems worth highlighting to me. I think most people tend to understand NPCs as 'GM tools' for accomplishing some kind of 'opposition' to the players, and so the basic idea is that they have to push <i>against</i> the NPCs with their PCs and that will produce conflict/story/the game/whatever. But when the PCs push against the NPCs -- I mean, individual NPCs especially -- the NPCs give way. They die, they change sides, they run away. For most players that's a little freaky -- to the point that it might take awhile to even notice -- and for many MCs/GMs it is very counter-intuitive.<br/><br/>The thing is, the NPCs give way but the situation doesn't necessarily -- Fronts that are based entirely around the motivations of a single NPC are incredibly fragile, and very easy to solve, which is of course why Fronts aren't supposed to be based around NPCs but instead around 'fundamental scarcity' that is expressed by lots of different things. The 'lots of different things' is important because of the fundamental malleability/fragility of NPCs. Also, to get very specific: you should at least as many Fronts/Threats based around <i>NPC weakness</i> as you have around <i>NPC strength</i>.<br/><br/>And yes, eventually players will start to realize that there is no challenge inherent in defeating or opposing a specific NPC, except insofar as that NPC is part of some situation or problem they want to resolve. But it's really important that the MC be willing (and eager) to let the PCs roll over their NPCs just as easily as the rules suggest, otherwise you will never see that shift and the MC will have to start arbitrarily making his NPCs 'stronger' and 'scarier' out of some misguided notion of where the conflict is supposed to be coming from.<br/><br/>In other words, if as MC you find yourself introducing 4-harm 2-armour large gangs because otherwise the game doesn't seem exciting enough... you have gone astray.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288828/#Comment_288828" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T13:14:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  1:14PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have not played AW yet but I am also reading the book with a mind towards running it.<br/><br/>I'd imagine that the tone will likely be set by the player booklets and chargen, much like Dogs in the Vineyard, I'd think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288830/#Comment_288830" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T13:23:00+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  1:23PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That and asking questions:<br/><br/>"So Angel, who have you been patching up lately?

I can probably sit down and say "let's say that instead of everything being dead and dry, it's green and intimidating," but much more than that and I've started to answer my own questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288852/#Comment_288852" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T15:00:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  3:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2010 3:09PM by Teataine.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you can totally keep the Driver and give him a gyrocopter, or a boat, or a mutated lizard-beast or a giant dragonfly based on your setting.

I can't really imagine it playing out otherwise, given the moves.<br/>3. While you can't define everything beforehand, it can definitely work to bring a "pitch" to character/setting creation. Our current game started with "It's Manhattan, there are spider aliens, and you're in a band."  We went from there.<br/><br/>Also, remember that Vx wrote the game for Meg, because she wanted a game about relationships that didn't always mean fucking each other over.  While the MC's job is partially to respond with fuckery, that's not the players' job.  The players can do whatever they like, including creating and fighting for slivers of beauty.  So if you want that in the game, it's really up to the players, not the MC.  The MC can create slivers of beauty through his NPCs, sure, but the players have to be the ones who decide to protect them or help them grow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288855/#Comment_288855" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T15:16:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  3:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I am way into the PA color myself.

So if you end up with ant-men and hoverbikes, you have only your players to blame. <br/><br/>But I'm not sure that color = thematic material, theme in this instance being "hopeful human stuff." Could you not have ant-men on hoverbikes and still have hopeful human stuff? I haven't played enough AW yet to see any hint of "hopeful human stuff" baked into its procedures. I get no sense from actual play that "hopeful human stuff" is an emergent property of AW, other than the "it's a Lumpley game so be sure to look for the emergent properties!" meme that may be out there, thereby making it true-ish. That meme may in fact be enough to keep most AW games on-track -- if you go into it expecting to experience hopeful human stuff, then you probably will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288859/#Comment_288859" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T15:37:25+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  3:37PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless your whole group is firmly committed to (there) being fucked-up skin-eating tribal barbarians who bbq babies and rape and pillage up and down the coast, the chances of that being a particular focus in your game are close to zero.

It says that you shouldn't plan too much ahead, that you should be making things up about the world on the fly only as the fictional conflicts demand during their actual unfolding play, and yet it seems to imply that if you deviate from its principles or the attitude of its text, even in the moment, you're either doing it wrong or no longer playing <i>Apocalypse World</i>. So you shouldn't plan ahead, yet if you deviate from its prescribed tone, even to follow the drama, you're out of bounds. It's a long, skinny sandbox. So the idea of green, overgrown apocalyptica is only valid if we all come up with it during play. Otherwise, it is illegal play because it violates the instances of GM advice, which are presented as rules.<br/><br/>I'll bet the game is sturdier than it purports to be. I'll bet I can rename all the stats and classes and moves, change the tone a bit, and the thing will still run. Otherwise I'd run the thing ASAP to test it out, but that I'm not that interested in another dusty-wasteland vision of the apocalypse right now. I'm much more interested in this thing's thrumming engine than I am in its attitude.<br/><br/><i>Edit:</i> Cut some material to avoid a debate I don't want until later.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288862/#Comment_288862" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T15:58:08+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  3:58PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure the principles prescribe or proscribe any sort of fictional color.

The green apocalypse can easily be part of Barf Forth Apocalyptica principle. "Cultivate imagery in your head and vomit it all over the fiction." If your apocalyptica includes lush forests, barf it forth.

The MC is however told not to commit to a storyline or any particular characters, that is the stuff that is made in play by the group. <br/><br/>When we played I spent a lot of time wondering what the look and feel of my Apocalypse World would be and this was essential to me being able to make the world feel real and to barf forther apocalyptica all over everything. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288869/#Comment_288869" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T16:32:36+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  4:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            framweard - that's the exact same reasoning I had gone with.

What about that world being green is really a plan? I haven't said anything more than I said by the world being a deserted wasteland.

I might be thinking that they're treehouses, but I shouldn't be too set in that until it's out at the table, but that can be during character creation.

As one GMs, the things the players come to care about become liabilities, and generally I've seen them go south in the skin eater kind of way you describe. But if you took an approach as in Dogs, where you are just responsible for creating conflicting motivations, and treat all the npcs as real folks, that might help. Also, you do get to chose how you hit them. You can choose to give them solid ground. I believe Vincent even gave a way for players to create allies they can rely on in the final version. If that is so, that's a start.<br/><br/>And the customization of the rules may be what you need too, as John Harper pointed out. But, you may have to doctor the characters as well. A lot of the craziness comes straight from the color that fleshes them out. Frex, violation gloves.

Really important.<br/><br/><b>Will:</b> Like John, I'm having trouble reading the text the way you are.  Vincent is trying to instruct the GM not to have pre-planned plots and scenes in mind, not to have an agenda and push it on the players like you do in some other games, yeah?  He's saying to follow the players to find out what's important.  I don't think he's saying you have to think in a small little box.  That seems weird.  And he says explicitly in Advanced Fuckery that you can have all sorts of custom moves and such with it still being Apocalypse World; there are entire categories of customization that are definitely still AW-as-written.  He also encourges more full-on hacks that stop being Apocalypse World and start being something else, but that only describes stuff outside the AW milleau.  I'm sorry you find it frustrating, but I guess I don't read it quite that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288883/#Comment_288883" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-25T19:01:08+00:00" title="August 25, 2010  7:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks again, everybody, I really appreciate the advice.

I like that way that Vincent:<br/><br/>a. Takes the GM role seriously, unlike many indie games and<br/>b. Deconstructs it, letting you know exactly what to do.<br/><br/>So I guess I interpret your "Feeding my own GM advice back to me as rules" as a positive thing. Even better, it works. There are games that constrain the GM massively and don't work.<br/><br/>That said, I do think Vincent's tone can be misleading. Poison'd, for example, comes across as a <i>massively</i> constrained game, like a boardgame.

It means you're not really ever negotiating your (character's) way out of a tough spot, player-to-GM, which I think is a commonish playstyle that would not work well in AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289002/#Comment_289002" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T14:14:15+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  2:14PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it helps the game immensely.

Thinking about it for a while, I can think of two reasons for the 'address the character' rule:<br/><br/>It makes sure everyone's on the same page. If the MC talks to my player but to another player directly, there's going to be some weird shifts in how the scenes play. I'm probably not likely to be happy that my scenes are more or less in player, but then the next scene is kind of the directorial style.<br/><br/>More importantly, if you're not addressing the players, you may not be detailing the fiction enough for moves to happen. As a player, I need to know the situation from my character's point of view, so that I can figure out when certain moves happen. <br/><br/><br/>I don't think it's wrong to want to have the GM-to-player discussion, AW just isn't the right game for people who play in that mode. The point of that rule is to make that clear, so I know that if I'm trying to play AW GM-to-player, it's not going to work as intended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Apocalypse World] Tone - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12829/apocalypse-world-tone/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Apocalypse World] Tone - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12829/apocalypse-world-tone/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Yeah, what Sage said.

Are you just going to take that?" then Sage might be thinking more in character and give a fictional response when then implies a move (or maybe not!).<br/><br/>Honestly, I think one of the great things about AW is that it encodes a particular style of GMing into the rules instead of being wishy-washy and just saying "Yeah, just do that GM thing that you know how to do."  That way, even if you decide not to following all of the MC rules, you're doing so EXPLICITLY instead of just not really being sure what the game is asking you to do.  It makes hacking AW super interesting too, because you can experiment with explicitly different GMing guidelines and see how it affects play when playtesting hacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289012/#Comment_289012" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T15:08:19+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  3:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For sure, there are plenty of good reasons to speak to a player-as-character\u2014it's a perfectly valid approach to play. It's not bad advice. But that doesn't necessarily make for a good <i>rule</i>, IMO.<br/><br/>Checking in with the player, to give him or her a chance to say what they're after by making a particular choice (either explicitly or implicitly) is a tool in my kit, and I'm not going to start throwing away wrenches because another group apparently has trouble rendering actions in the fiction, you know what I mean? <br/><br/>I feel like AW is specifically calibrated to solve a problem I don't have: getting players to render their actions in the fiction, rather than just declare their "moves." I have a move (to borrow the term, here) to get players to render their actions in the fiction. I say, "What does that look like?" or "What does [this other character] see or hear when you do that?" I use it in D&amp;D, I use in Lady Blackbird, I use it in everything. Works great.<br/><br/>I am sometimes technically speaking to the player when I do that, so I am breaking a rule of AW.<br/><br/>I'm all for a challenge, I guess, that says "try doing it this other way," but it's not like I've never tried the address-the-character approach. I use it sometimes, too. My kit's full of wrenches and hammers and drivers that I've picked up over the years. But I'm not hearing that AW is an interesting dare, I'm hearing that it's the New Thing that'll improve our games. That we'll be playing right and better if only we follow the rules.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite><br/><br/>I don't think it's wrong to want to have the GM-to-player discussion, AW just isn't the right game for people who play in that mode.</blockquote>\nIt seems, though, that AW is the new technology and that I am either a heathen if I decide it is not for me, or I am treated as if I do not Get It. For a game that's as angled and pointed and aggressively focused as AW is, can it be so surprising that it wouldn't hit all available targets in the audience? I mean, I don't think it's even <i>trying</i> to be the One Game for Everyone, is it?<br/><br/>(<i>Note:</i> I <i>didn't</i> edit this one.

That doesn't sound like breaking the spirit of the rule, maybe the exact language, technically speaking, but it's not like the AW cops are going to come out and get you, right?  Vincent isn't going to appear in your living room and declare you uncool.  If it works in the moment and in the context -- which we obviously can't know anything about -- then do it, yeah?  AW isn't a fascist my-way-or-the-highway thing.<br/><br/>Also, I don't think AW claims to be doing anything new, GM-wise.  The new thing, IMO, is that it's making it all super explicit.  I'm sure that you and other folks have been using the techniques that AW formalizes as MC rules for years and years.  I've certain done some of this in an informal way and feel like, personally speaking, AW helps me be a better GM by making this toolkit readily and consistently available to me.  I would love for more games to make their GM guidelines this explicit, because not everybody has the same GM toolkit and mine is definitely weaker than lots of other folks'.<br/><br/>Finally, I think folks are trying to share their own opinions of why AW works for them, not convert you to the worship of AW.  I'm certainly just trying to share my own experience.  If you have different experiences, that's totally cool and expected.  If you decide it's not the game for you, whatever.  Maybe you just get whatever you get out of it and move on, y'know?  For me, it's definitely given me a lot of new stuff to think about, but maybe you're like "oh yeah, I'm already doing that" and move on.  Hopefully there's other stuff there that you can get out of it, different stuff than what I get, probably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289017/#Comment_289017" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T15:26:52+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  3:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

This is not to say that he did something wrong, unless his goal was specifically to persuade or capture <i>me</i> out of the audience. My intent isn't to say that one cannot make advice into game rules, but to draw attention to the fact that, when you do, you exclude manners of play or mark them as unwelcome. Exhibit: Me.<br/><br/>For example, I don't want to "barf forth" apocalyptica (though I love that last word). I want to evoke it, conjure it out of smoke and glass, make it come alive. I want to inspire the players to conjure it, too, and make it breathe in their imaginations. I want apocalyptica to strike us like lightning and leave us smoking but alive. I want visions of apocalyptica to rattle, to battle, to harrow us home.<br/><br/>I don't want it like slippery, sticky vomit, I want it like an eerie song or a hushed tale whispered at the feet of dead giants. So a perfectly valid choice of tone\u2014barf forth, you bloody MCs!\u2014happens to miss me as a target. Nothing wrong with that.

And it isn't "Address the characters." It's "<b>Address yourself to the characters, not the players</b>."<br/><br/>I understand the innate flexibility of rules. This isn't my first rodeo. Yes, I'm being a pedant\u2014I write and parse text for a living. I take this stuff seriously. Baker made a choice to write these as very strict MC rules (e.g., emphasis mine: "<i>Everything</i> you say, you should do it to accomplish these three, <i>and no other.</i>") and one consequence of that is that the text turned me off.<br/><br/>What do we gain from this strict language that we wouldn't gain from strong sentences that weren't extremes? "Barf forth apocalyptica" is a finely written rule, even if I don't agree with its tone, and even if I think it deserves a chapter rather than a paragraph.<br/><br/>Every rule is a restriction, though, isn't it? We just talked about that: creative restraints. Our ability to disregard rules is fine and useful and good, but I don't think a rule should be written for maximum restriction if its intent is to be flexible.<br/><br/>In comparison, <i>Lady Blackbird</i> tells you how to GM it, but feels less restrictive. Why is that? (I have my own notions, but I won't lay them out here.) I'm talking actual nitty-gritty of <i>how rules are composed</i> here. I felt very comfortable using, and sometimes disregarding, the GM advice there. I took it as quality advice, <i>describing</i> something that met with success for you, not <i>prescribing</i> something that must be done to be proper. <br/><br/>As written, <i>Apocalypse World</i> feels more restrictive. That the restriction is largely illusory\u2014because of course I could always make fluffy bunnies and sunflowers appear in the fiction and address the players about how they feel about that in the conversation of play\u2014doesn't dissolve the influence of the text. Can we talk about the influence and tone of the work instead of just hand-waving it away when it doesn't jibe with our actual play? Because I think the tone of a text makes a difference, too, and I think the space between reading and play is important in the life of a game.<br/><br/>Understand that I'm not saying I couldn't make AW do what I want. I'm not saying I'd be unable to play it. I'm questioning whether the text of the work actually helps me engage with the game or understand play. See the difference?<br/><br/>Play will absolutely change the way I see the game, but the way I react to the text itself is also relevant, isn't it? A game isn't just an instance of actual play, it's also the rules.<br/><br/>We don't have to share the same opinion on this, obviously, but try to understand that my opinion isn't coming from a place of total ignorance.<br/><br/>(Edit: I've cut some additional comments that are reactions to what I can only imagine are your efforts to get a rise out of me, John.)<br/><br/>(Edit2: Jason, which examples of doing it wrong?)<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289028/#Comment_289028" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T16:39:47+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  4:39PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Will, when I run AW for you, you'll see that, as MC, I address myself to the characters.

I\u2019ve proof-read a couple...and have read sections of a couple others which doesn\u2019t make me much of an expert. I have, however, read lots and lots of books, so I feel confident about saying that Vincent Baker\u2019s Apocalypse World is one of the friendliest, most open-handed books I\u2019ve read. As I read Baker\u2019s explanation of how to run his game I had the image of a trusted friend leading me through the process. Baker, in essence, took my hand and stepped me through the thought process of his game without ever talking down to me. He was abundantly clear not just on what you do, but how and why without ever being patronizing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I said...is that the text was very generous. I\u2019ve had difficulties explaining that, but I think I mean that in explaining the way to think in Apocalypse World, Baker never implies that it is the only way to think. It is simply the best way to think for the game that you\u2019re playing. Especially in the section about how to be a MC (Apocalypse World\u2019s version of a GM) he says repeatedly that you want to function like this or you want to think like that not because you have to, but because the game is the most rewarding to both the MC and the players when played that way. Throughout the text he sounds very concerned that we have a really good time playing his game and I got the feeling that no one would be happier than him if we did.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it fascinating (in the totally non snarky sense) that the professional text parser found the tone off putting, while the non expert rarely-reads-rule-books person found it welcoming and inviting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289033/#Comment_289033" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T16:57:13+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  4:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will, I would love to talk about how the style of writing in AW serves its goals as a game text.

That it's communicating techniques that work to players (I include GMs) who can use them immediately is excellent. That it is concerned with how it is run well, and how to express that, is fantastic.<br/><br/><i>&lt; snip &gt;</i><br/><br/>Is conflating that craftsmanship with game rules a good idea? I'm genuinely torn. I mean, player moves and MC moves are different enough that I, personally, am not sure they should have the same name, mechanically, for example. (One is what happens in the fiction to engage the mechanics and one is what you do in reaction to mechanics or fiction to make the fiction engaging.) If making them rules is empowering other GMs, then great. I think pushing me away is probably worth that, for reals.<br/><br/>I'm really not sure how to address this without coming across as arrogant, but while I celebrate the idea of explicit, specific GM advice and tool-bestowment in a game text (I tried to do this with the Storytelling Adventure System stories for WW; I don't know if they stuck with it), I didn't feel like AW was giving me material I didn't have. I felt like it was commanding me to withhold good techniques for the sake of running the game in sync with someone else's personal taste. <br/><br/>Frankly, I'd rather read Vincent's book <i>describing</i> how to run an engaging fiction-driven RPG session and campaign than have it be given as a few paragraphs of <i>prescriptive</i> game rules in the middle of a book that is so attitude driven that it drove right past my post-apocalyptic interests. Maybe I'm the only one who feels that way. Fair enough.<br/><br/>But, to be clear, I would pay good fucking money to read that book if Vincent wrote it.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289039/#Comment_289039" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T17:51:49+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  5:51PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Will, now that you've been reading and digesting the AW text, what are you envisioning as the absolute worst case scenario in actual play?

Or do we have to fall back on reading the rules more tightly or more loosely?</blockquote>\nI think this is an excellent question, and the way Will put it earlier about distinguishing between "craft" and "rules" is quite interesting. In a way, I think that RPG culture with regard to rules helps to set us up for success here. Namely, it's super common in the RPG community to say "hey, look, a rule that doesn't work for me. Better change or replace it!" So, having "these are the GMing rules, no changes, rahr!" isn't really any different than "these are the combat rules, no changes, rahr!"  which we've all pretty much blown past by now.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when I say "we've all" above, I don't really mean 'all', of course, and I think the inclusivity (or exclusivity) of that category has direct bearing on this question. What I mean is that these GM "rules" are clearly less necessary for people who already have it figured out (I wish I did! I had some of this stuff, but certainly not all of it, and I try to design games for pete's sake!). But for people new to the hobby, or even just new to this particular way to running a game, they can be totally invaluable, but perhaps most importantly, by expressing them as rules rather than as 'best practices' or 'guidelines' or 'advice' or 'advanced playcraft' or whatever, these players are getting implicit permission to try this stuff out and/or get their friends to go along with it. When it's presented as "the rules for this new game you're trying", however, it's an easier pill to swallow (or at least, I think it is).  I too would snatch up a GM advice book by Vincent in a heartbeat, though I think I've seen him say before "that's what my games are for". I just love generalized, pedantic advice. Such a format, however, would be pretty easy for some folks to say "oh, that doesn't apply to my game" or "that's just advice, I already know how to GM, so I'll ignore it".<br/><br/>So, um, I guess my response is that this *might* be the best compromise we can hope for, since the "this is the rules" approach is probably most useful for communicating these concepts to people not already on board with them, while those who already get it, or partially get it, will be more comfortable with seeing the 'advice' behind the 'rules'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289064/#Comment_289064" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T21:48:13+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  9:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've GMed for years and years and years and developed my own GM toolkit. It's totally just one way of doing things and I rarely ever change the way I do things because why would I?<br/><br/>For me, the MC stuff in AW is invaluable because it kinda forces me to use someone else's toolkit for awhile. It's a neat exercise; like getting to be someone else for a day! I'm not sure how constructive my comments are, but I thought I'd chime in and throw my two cents in. If AW weren't so explicit, I wouldn't read it so thoroughly or learn anything from it. When it comes time to make my changes to the game, I'll start to revert to my own toolkit, but running vanilla AW has been a) a ton of goddamn fun and b) a learning experience like few other games offer.<br/><br/>Whether it's your first game or merely most recent in a long line, I think doing things by the little black book at least once is a useful exercise, and well worth the money. It's like attending a GMing class taught by Vx!<br/><br/>...So I guess if you don't feel like you need any of that, yeah, the book would fall a little flat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289110/#Comment_289110" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T05:57:39+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  5:57AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I am rather happy that Apocalypse world presupposes a facilitative GM whose primary interest is to make character lives not boring and see what happens from that, while keeping the world feeling real. This is so much less exhausting than indie / story games that expect you to come in as a story-directing GM and then constrain you down play nice with the other players.* <br/><br/>I really like that these techniques have been written up in a format for folks who aren't used to them, despite being a little distressed by how many people are surprised by these techniques. My one worry is that there isn't a strong sense of evaluating feedback - two of your agendas are ultimately social in nature: making character's lives interesting and making the world seem real - which means whether you are meeting these agenda depends on the feedback you get related to it. <br/><br/>Apocalypse World has many elements and techniques for the MC to worry about, and while the first session is clearly meant to ease that learning curve, that doesn't resolve the biggest difficulty for the MC, which is that pulling all these together is a big balancing act. There is a huge room for second guessing after the fact (because in the situation you can only consider a smaller number of options than under reflection). <br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/>*Now, whether story-directing or facilitative GMing is more "traditional" is a different matter, but I will at least argue that being a facilitative GM is a reasonable consequence to reading 80s and 90s GM advice and paying attention to the social context of the gaming group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289116/#Comment_289116" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T06:31:15+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  6:31AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2010 6:31AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider me extremely skeptical of anyone saying they already have Apocalypse World and its "GMing rules" figured out without playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289128/#Comment_289128" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T07:37:26+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  7:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, when I started reading through the play-test version of AW in preparation for running our game, I was <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=256434" rel="nofollow">very much in Will's position</a>.  I remember skimming the MC section when I first read it exactly like Jonathan describes above- "yeah, okay, this is the 'how do you GM?' section, I'll skip on to the actual rules."  Of course, anybody who's been <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11617" rel="nofollow">reading old threads</a> can see that didn't work out too well for us, and a lot of in depth discussion was required before I started to understand what was missing.<br/><br/>Having read through the final version of the text, I'd say it's much better now for all of that discussion.  I think the examples are clearer and the MC advice more specific.  Having played and talked about it I understand it all better, but I can see why someone reading the text would be confused.  While a lot of the MC advice are techniques we already use, there is much to AW that breaks down when played with our standard methods (looking for the conflict, for example).  That you must consciously set aside your usual tools- unlearning how to GM- before picking up AW is both maddening and essential to understand.<br/><br/>In any case, say what you want about the game or the text, but <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/search.php?PostBackAction=Search&amp;Keywords=apocalypse+world&amp;Type=Topics&amp;btnSubmit=Search" rel="nofollow">it certainly got us all talking</a>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289130/#Comment_289130" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T07:49:14+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  7:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

It also highlights, though, that it's the enthusiasm of AW players that had me once and has me again enthusiastic to try the game.<br/><br/>And while I think I've made it pretty clear that I a) may eat crow over this later, and b) am speaking solely from the place between reading and play (which is a valid place to have an opinion on a text, IMO), I do appreciate Bret re-characterizing my position and implying that I'm either stupid or a liar. Thanks for that, man. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Drop the quotation marks, though. From the book: <b>"... Apocalypse World calls for one way in particular. This chapter is it. Follow these as rules. The whole rest of the game is built upon this." </b>The next page even calls the game's approach "strict" and "pretty traditional." Is it so hard to believe that someone might think they already have experience with a "pretty traditional" approach to play?<br/><br/>Is it so hard to believe that by excluding all but one of the "million ways to GM games," you might push away some GMs, too?<br/><br/>Anyway. Graham asked about Fronts, and I should say that they're one of those things that I'm curious to see in actual play. As written, I think they seem like pretty terrific architecture for pre-<i>defining</i> potential threats without pre-<i>planning</i> how they'll unfold. They seem to conceptualize enemies in both immediately fictional and compellingly thematic ways, so as a means of organizing pieces before play, I think Fronts look awfully strong. I dig how the countdown clocks subtly slip some pre-planned events into the play space, too\u2014like you shouldn't pre-determined what will happen, but you can predefine that there <i>can be</i> (will be?) a quarantine breach, which is dancing right on the line of pre-determined play. I think it's a good mechanism.<br/><br/>As to Paul's great question, I think I've sussed out my fear of the rigidity of GM style as rules. If I run AW for someone who's read the book, and I do something that's not explicitly an MC move in the book (even though the book tosses out MC moves all over the place, beyond the list of them in the chapter that "is it"), I'm concerned that play will be interrupted by a player who says, "You can't do that." I'm concerned that I'd share a bit of AP, and you all would say, "That shit may fly in your head, but it's not welcome in AW." I'm concerned that by making them rules, we've created another means by which to say that someone is Doing It Wrong, even though the players, in the heat of play, were all engrossed and engaged.<br/><br/>If we're all just going to say, "Yeah, we can wave off the importance of these rules whenever we want," then... what is the value in solidifying these things into rules?<br/><br/>The only answer I've heard is that codifying the advice into rules made people sit up and take notice of them, and then go, "Hey, these are pretty good techniques! I'm going to use them." And that's awesome. But, I'm asking, would these same specific examples of techniques and practices be just as valuable by being <i>specific</i> and <i>detailed</i> as they are? (Maybe not\u2014maybe we all would have glossed right over them if they weren't rules. I'm asking.)<br/><br/>Because, when I read that bit I quoted above, about how all GM tricks save these were unwelcome, I gave that some weight, in part because the author chose to single that shit out and in part because that author was Vincent Fucking Baker.<br/><br/>What the rules are matters. How they're written? Also matters. Maybe I give more weight to RAW than, what, I should? That's a whole other thing.<br/><br/>Seriously, though: Vincent and AW deserve lots of credit just for provoking this conversation. If it sounds like I'm saying otherwise, that's my fault. I think I've been pretty clear that I'm trying to talk about the execution, not just the philosophy. I'm not saying, "How dare he?" I'm saying, "The way he did this didn't quite work for me." For me. YMMV, etc.<br/><br/>I appreciate all y'all helping me form my opinion on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289146/#Comment_289146" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T09:12:56+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  9:12AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>And while I think I've made it pretty clear that I a) may eat crow over this later, and b) am speaking solely from the place between reading and play (which is a valid place to have an opinion on a text, IMO), I do appreciate Bret re-characterizing my position and implying that I'm either stupid or a liar.

You weren't the only person posting in this thread saying that, and having run the game I'd be impressed if someone were to just pick it up and play it effectively right off the bat, and I mean sincerely impressed. It took me ten sessions to feel like I was even close to understanding how to MC the game, and that's after feeling like I figured it out on my first read-through. My first six sessions disabused me of that. Hence my skepticism at other people making that claim.<br/><br/>If you want to proceed with a discussion about this, let's do that because I have a lot to say about it, but if your next post is also going to assume the worst about what I'm writing and take it as personally insulting, let's just both back off and save it for another day, okay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289147/#Comment_289147" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T09:18:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  9:18AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might have been mentioned up thread somewhere (reading lots of AW posts, they get mixed up in my head) but this interview with Vincent:<br/><br/><a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2010/08/19/show059-interview-with-vincent-baker/" rel="nofollow">Theory from the Closet interview with Vincent Baker</a><br/><br/>has some of his thoughts on designing the GM procedures as rules (and lots of other stuff too, most of the discussion that seems germane to this topic happens in the last 20 or 30 minutes of the hour and 45 minute long interview).<br/><br/>I think your core point about questioning what effect the presentation has (as rules, tone, et cetera) is a good one to discuss. I also feel like some of the 'attitude' you mention up thread that you found less agreeable might have just been Vincent going for the apocalyptic aesthetic he had in mind, rather than any inherent attitude towards the recommendations as "GM skills/rules". That may be something you've already taken into account and you're *still* bothered, in which case, my apologies. By way of example, saying "Barf Forth Apocalyptica" is, as you say, a vivid and unpleasant mental image versus "Conjure Apocalyptica from the Aether" or whatever else. I'd assume that the choice there was to purposely go with something unpleasant and harsh in order to convey the unpleasant and harsh nature of the default mostly implied AW setting. Since so little setting material is given explicitly, such implicit cues become very important.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, also, I wanted to say that I think it's significant that the GM rules (given as rules) in AW appear in the context of the "Advanced Fuckery" chapter being there in the same book. In other words, rather than just having a throwaway line in the GM advice chapter of "oh yeah, and if something isn't working, change it", there's a whole chapter on "here are some ways you can change the rules of the game, and the effects you might expect to get from them". So all of those "do it this way and no other!" type rules for GMing have an explicit, helpful way of saying "do it this way and no other <i>for this particular game</i>, but if you want to play some other game that might be similar or very different, here's some tools for that too"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289151/#Comment_289151" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T09:25:07+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  9:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2010 9:30AM by sage.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem Will.

We're kind of used to breaking rules, but now we at least know when we're breaking them in GMing. My take is that, by phrasing them as rules, Vx has given me a better understanding of when I'm bringing mynown ideas to the table. <br/><br/>So, rolling initiative each round in D&amp;D is a rules change you can make as a house rule, just like different fundamental scarcities could be brought in and it's just house ruled AW. Neither is likely to break the game, but both are rules changes. <br/><br/>Likewise, changing D&amp;D to use 3d6 instead of d20 rolls is like changing 'address the players,' they're both valid but you have to know that they'll have huge repercussions throughout the game. I'd probably call this a hombrew or hack, not just a house rule. <br/><br/>So yeah, that's the value I get out of it.

I've sure been thinking on it this past week.<br/><br/>As for Advanced Fuckery, I thought it was notable that the chapter talks about custom moves and even a bit about AW hacks for parkour and Celtic intrigue... but that it doesn't talk about different agendas or principles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289156/#Comment_289156" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T09:34:23+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  9:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different agendas or principles?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289162/#Comment_289162" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T09:43:48+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  9:43AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I counter-apologized and should elaborate a bit on my terse, asshole-sounding initial post.

If I run AW for someone who's read the book, and I do something that's not explicitly an MC move in the book (even though the book tosses out MC moves all over the place, beyond the list of them in the chapter that "is it"), I'm concerned that play will be interrupted by a player who says, "You can't do that." I'm concerned that I'd share a bit of AP, and you all would say, "That shit may fly in your head, but it's not welcome in AW." I'm concerned that by making them rules, we've created another means by which to say that someone is Doing It Wrong, even though the players, in the heat of play, were all engrossed and engaged.</blockquote>\nI have, hopefully, one tidbit that will totally and completely put this fear of yours to rest: It is also a "rule" (?) that <b>the MC never speaks the name of his move</b>. <br/><br/>Seriously, if you come up with something you want to do (prompted/provoked by the moves or not) that you <i>can't</i> fit into a move, even retroactively, I'll be incredibly surprised. Add the extra flexibility of threat moves and it becomes really obvious, in actual play, that the moves aren't restrictions but rather very broad prompts.<br/><br/>Never, and I mean <i>not ever</i>, will a player be able to rules-lawyer an MC about what moves are or are not legit. In fact the moves grant MCs a lot lot lot of discretionary power (see "do harm (as established)" and "trade harm for harm" for examples). If you have anything to fear as an MC, it shouldn't be "oh for fuck's sake some jackass player is gonna rules lawyer me into a box" but rather "oh man they just missed this vital roll so do I paste 'em with a grenade or what?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289190/#Comment_289190" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T11:14:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2010 11:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I was saying at lunch today that I want to see Harper run this.

As I get more deeply into the fronts section I'm sure I'll find more, but it's more a matter of being surprised and a little bit creeped out at the striking similarity to what I would normally do. <br/><br/>One way or another I'm intending to run the game as closely to how the MC sections describe as possible, provided that the tone of the game doesn't scare of my prospective play groups...<br/><br/>Now my personal culture of play has been, especially over the past few years, informed by games which I'm pretty sure no one else here has any interaction with so I can't say that my experience is generalizable. I seem to recall running games this way for a long while, but memory is an unreliable thing, it is impossible for me to say for sure how I would have reacted to Apocalypse World if it had been released in, say 2000.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289264/#Comment_289264" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T16:48:44+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  4:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2010 4:49PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The method of GMing that Vincent encoded into AW just so happened to be a method of GMing that I have used a lot over the years. It's the method I used for our long-running Warhammer 2ed game, for example. It's a method that I despaired of ever describing successfully to another person. Another reason I was so excited about AW was because it created a way to express that GMing style in a way that someone else can implement. Like finding a perfectly illustrated manual for an obscure martial arts style that you enjoy.<br/><br/>Someone asks me how I like to run a game, I can hand them AW and go, "Like this!"

And then again.<br/><br/>I'm going to again tonight, because I frankly fear this fucking game. It's making a skill I've done elsewhere for years feel new again. I welcome and dislike that simultaneously. That's on me, folks, but I know where that gut reaction is coming from.<br/><br/>The thing that I feel like I'm really getting out of it, though, is "listen, MC, I'm going to teach you how to react *right*." Much of the GM advice I've read over the years isn't about reaction, not really. Some is, yes, but then not so detailed as what AW's doing. To a large degree it's proceduralizing the GM's job of reacting.<br/><br/>And the way a GM reacts is what breaths life into a game. Vincent gets this, and what he's designed to deal with it is fucking interesting. I have found a similar thing with Mythender: when I reacted in certain ways as GM, my early playtesters would say "Dude, I don't feel fucking mythic. Fuck you." So I see what AW is doing, and I'm all "oh shit! I get why!" If you deviate from those forms of reaction, you're not selling the truths Vincent states is AW. GM reaction to players is key.<br/><br/>My main problem with the text is that it's not helping me internalize this thing. And the way it's great for someone who is new to GMing is probably to same reason why it's making me feel stressed out about my game tomorrow. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but that's because the text isn't helping on that front.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li

list of them in the chapter that "is it"), I'm concerned that play will be interrupted by a player who says, "You can't do that."</blockquote>\nHaving been an MC and now playing a game, let me say that as a player I spend to much of my time thinking "what the fuck can I do to get out of this situation? am I gonna die here?" to really be worrying about whether that thing the MC said could maybe

Maybe I'm overthinking it, but that's because the text isn't helping on that front.</blockquote>\nSo Tony ran AW for the first time a couple of weeks ago and he also said that he was terrified of running the game, despite having run his own hack, Apocalypse D&amp;D, a whole bunch.  But the thing that he seemed to discover -- and I've watched John do this in play too -- is that, when you don't know what to do, you don't have to fall back onto stuff you've internalized (like you do in most games), you just have to <i>look down at the sheet in front of you that explicitly lists your moves, and pick one</i>.  Sure, over time, after running a lot of AW, you'll end up internalizing most of them and go "Oh, yeah, here's where I Threaten Badness."  But in the beginning -- or when you have a momentary lapse -- it totally works to look down at your sheet, pick one silently, and then go "Okay, here's what happens..."  In our games, we even giggle sometimes when the MC says, "Hmm, you failed 3 times in a row, so I guess I'm filling in these sections of this Threat countdown..." as we wait in anticipation for the fuckery that we know is coming.<br/><br/>MCing AW doesn't have to take the form of that "magical GM" stuff that Brand used to talk about, where you're juggling all these plates in the air while at the same time making it look effortless.  Fuck that.  It says "misdirect," not "don't let them see you sweat" or "pretend you're the perfect GM."  You can totally say, "I'm going to go walk down the hall to get another beer and think about my next move" or "give me a sec while I look at my list" or whatever.  Especially the first time you're running a new game (any game), that kind of thing should be expected, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289354/#Comment_289354" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T10:26:01+00:00" title="August 28, 2010 10:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2010 10:40AM by Judd.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3 quick things:<br/><br/><br/>1) Let's play it, see if its a disaster, see if the text works for us in the trenches, start threads about what worked and didn't work and move from there.<br/><br/>2) Let's be okay with other people being uneasy and not liking a text.

All's well.<br/><br/>I hope I didn't ruin everything by continuing this past Post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2342&amp;Mode=like">#42</a>, though. (Let "Post #42" be our referential metric for "the point at which Jason Morningstar wisely bails from a thread," perhaps.)<br/><br/>Anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289461/#Comment_289461" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T18:01:15+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  6:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All is definitely well.
