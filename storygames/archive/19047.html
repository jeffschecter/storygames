On a 10+, they have to choose: force<br/>your hand and suck it up, or cave and do what you want. On a 7\u20139, they can<br/>instead choose 1:<br/>\u2022 get the hell out of your way<br/>\u2022 barricade themselves securely in<br/>\u2022 give you something they think you want<br/>\u2022 back off calmly, hands where you can see<br/>\u2022 tell you what you want to know (or what you want to hear)<br/><br/>So to me it's like a non-directed violence threat or a directed threat of violence for purpose other than violence.  Players will often be in a situation and decide there's an NPC they don't like or someone needs some pain and say, "I wanna shoot this guy... I'll roll Going Agro!"  And I say, "No need to roll.  You do." The game can then progress with a firefight with me returning Harm for Harm ("What do you do?") or the NPC can wallow away or die.  I got hung up my first few times running AW when players would want to start a fight and roll Going Agro and I get to choose one of those options which makes for a kinda anticlimactic firefight when everyone you shoot barricades themselves in or starts throwing things they think you want at you.<br/><br/>I tried to use it as a threat type move but it just got in the way of Sieze by Force. I just need some good examples where this move is functional.  I had a player smash someones face into a bar to get some information and rolled a 7 on Going aggro... so options on and two are out... three is valid... four is not an option since the character has hold of his hair and five is the same as three... so... it's not really an option and it's just as good as a 10+ then... so... no real tension in the roll... why did we even roll?<br/><br/>So... I need to know why I should let this move back in my games.  From a design and GM perspective the use of Going Agro is strange to me. I prefer to let things happen as the player states when violence is concerned. <br/><br/>From a design standpoint Hack And Slash from Dungeon World is a nice and clear cut move. I know exactly where to place it and even though its just the same as me doing Harm for Harm with a roll to possibly prevent me from using that move it's effective and I understand it.  Dungeon World isn't supposed to be evoking a fiction (like AW is apocalypse fiction or Monster Hearts is teen monster drama fiction)  it's evoking D&amp;D and players roll to attack in D&amp;D... done.   But AW is different and I don't get this move.<br/><br/>DISCUSS!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425260/#Comment_425260" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T22:18:22+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 10:18PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2013 10:21PM by Noofy.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read Mr. Harper's wonderfully insightful <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/aw-seize-by-force-is-peripheral-move.html" rel="nofollow">post</a> on the problems with 'Seize...'?<br/>I find it clears up my discrepancy every time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I find going aggro is by far the best way to apply fictional effects in the aftermath of a moves snowball (which can be far more informative and influential to the narrative than simple harm).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425266/#Comment_425266" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T23:06:04+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 11:06PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2013 11:08PM by Golux.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just read the thread you described.  I find the opposite to be true in my games.  I often have situations where NPC's have or have taken things the PC's want and seize by force is a viable option for getting it back.  It seems to me that Go Aggro is used with the threat of violence (or the 10+ doesn't make sense) but if that's true.. just use Manipulate with the threat of violence as the promise because that's what you're doing when you threaten.  It's manipulation by violence.  If I threaten someone to give me the information I want or I will shoot them in the leg.  I will promise to NOT shoot you in the leg if you give me the information.  I fail the roll then I'm not really convincing the NPC or PC in question that I will do this thing and fun erupts! You can make Manipulate be rolled with Hard in cases where violence is the promise aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's the same as Go Aggro... so why have two moves? There are some minor differences... like I can roll a 10+ with my Go Aggro check and it's like manipulation... but I failed because the target of the move says to EFF off and I HAVE to carry out my threat which is kinda crappy for the player. <br/><br/>If I'm using Manipulation on someone and I roll a 10+ they don't get to call me on it... with go Aggro it's like failing a won roll on a 10+.  I'm threatening so I DON'T have to do it.  Go Aggro is the only move that when you WIN you are forced to do something you might not want to do.  It's counter to a LOT of passages in the book that say that if a player succeeds you can't take the victory away from them.. you can add complications and caveats but at the end of the day, they succeeded. Go Aggro isn't like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425267/#Comment_425267" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T01:23:21+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  1:23AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2013 1:25AM by Rafu.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your smashing someone's face into the bar example: on a 7-9, giving you what smashed-face thinks you want or telling you what you want to hear is <i>not necessarily the same</i> as doing what you wanted in the first place. Maybe you smashed his face into the bar 'cause you wanted to know who killed Dremmer, but he insists he doesn't actually now and just gives you a clue, that he heard a gun shooting in autofire mode before Dremmer was found dead. Or maybe, in this particular case, a 7-9 <i>really</i> was as good as a 10+: hey, it happens! No big deal.<br/>But the tension, the tension was still there, 'cause on a 6-, jesus, the MC would've fucked with you real hard. Like, have <i>your</i> face smashed into the bar \u2014 that's the baseline, unimaginative option.<br/><br/>The difference between going aggro on someone and manipulating them with the threat of violence? It's whether <i>you're going to follow through</i> on your threats. If it's a bluff, you're manipulating them. If you're negotiating, calmly, and the gun in your hand or your gang cornering them happens to be your leverage on them, you're still manipulating. Smashing someone's face into the bar, that's going aggro. Shooting them in the kneecap, that's going aggro. Pushing them down a flight of stairs, that's going aggro.<br/>It's like, by the time you're rolling dice for going aggro your finger was already half-way through pulling the trigger and won't really stop \u2014 you're fully committed to killing. It's just that the poor fucker gets a magic last-split-second chance to do the right thing, piss their pants and give you something better than splattered brains. If they don't, you've already settled for splattered brains, alright. If you give half a fuck about this guy's living or dieing, nope, I don't think you're actually <i>going aggro</i>.<br/><br/>And sometimes, you just shoot people because you want them dead. Which means on a 10+ you get what you want, they're dead. On a 7-9, fuck, guess they're still alive, but at least they pissed their pants and they're not giving you any more problems right now.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425268/#Comment_425268" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T02:12:38+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  2:12AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But why am I making my players roll to Go Aggro if the end result is the the NPC gets to do action... It's counter intuitive.  If you say, "I'm smashing his face into the bar."  Why do I have YOU roll to let ME decide to give you what you want or walk away with my hands up. It doesn't make sense as a move.  If a 10+ is keep doin' what your doin'... don't roll for it... do it.  If as a GM I want him at the last second to say, "OH GOD WAIT A MINUTE I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT!"  He STILL gets to do what he wants... be that bash his face into the bar or calm down and let the guy talk. Don't make a player roll to possibly have someone stop his action.  He either WANTS to bash his face in... or wants to THREATEN to bash his face in.  If he wants to bash the guys face in, a partial success turns it into a threat that he DOESN'T carry out. That's a terrible success. <br/><br/>Bottom line.  You get robbed of your intention by going aggro and having a partial success and a 10+ is either just a banal... do what you wanted to do in the first place, or NOW it's a threat you made and instead of you doing what you want you now CAN'T and the NPC gets to choose.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425272/#Comment_425272" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T03:45:40+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  3:45AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see\u2026 It's a move for one-way violence. But violence in itself is rarely an end, more often a tool that people enjoy a little too much. It's all about establishing dominance.<br/>One way to put it, is: Go aggro is the move for when a PC is employing violence (note: not merely the threat of violence, that's Manipulate) and they're most likely not going to get hurt in exchange, but still something could go wrong (if it's obvious they're most likely going to get hurt in exchange, it's Seize instead; if nothing could go wrong, don't even roll).<br/>If they really have it their way (10+) they reap the benefits of being violent: they either hurt or control their victim. If there's nothing they want out of their victim but hurt them, they hurt them. If said victim's too tough or crazy or stubborn to give up free will, they can suck it up, which more often than not means they die: you can't rob them of this chance to be a big damn tragic hero, sure, if that's what they really want. If the victim can suck it up and it costs them nothing serious, hmm, try with <i>more serious</i> violence next time?<br/>If they don't quite have it their way but sorta (7-9), they still establish themselves as the alpha. Victim's got an escape route, but whatever it is it's an all-out defeat: they're running from the violent person, metaphorically or actually.<br/>And there's still a chance they don't have it their way, not at all, and then it's on the MC, as usual. Shifting the sitch from one-way violence to an actual battle is only one of the options.<br/><br/>My bottom line is \u2014 in my AP experience, "Go aggro" is a move which seriously shaped the social landscape of our apocalypse world: it emerged as a tough, brutal world, where people often let their guns do the talking, and violent death is always on the table as a possible outcome of most interactions. This doesn't have to be <i>your</i> apocalypse world, though. If going aggro, as a move, doesn't make sense to you, stick to your judgment and do what makes sense. OTOH, if it makes sense to you in principle, but don't like it in the details of execution\u2026 well, fix it! And then tell us about it. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425278/#Comment_425278" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T07:32:36+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  7:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hard is the will to commit violence. What I think is useful about Go Aggro is that it is a <i>commitment</i> to violence on the character's part which colors Apocalypse World a certain way.  Once you've made that commitment, whether the violence is going to happen is out of your control.  <br/><br/>The 7-9 moves give the victim the chance to not give you exactly what you want and not die from it.  They hand control of the violence back to you, the player.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425281/#Comment_425281" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T08:02:06+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  8:02AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't say I've managed to communicate this clearly to the other players, so it doesn't always feel like we're on the same page and everybody knows how the move works...<br/><br/>... but I think going aggro really needs to be played as going <i>aggro</i>, begin aggressive. Like, it's not the combination [threat of violence] + [stated intention] + [commitment to follow through from the player] that makes it go aggro, it needs to be aggressive. As Rafu said, if you (the character) care about how badly the other person gets hurt, you're thinking it through too much for it to be going aggro.<br/><br/>You know when you're talking to NPCs which are known to be hot-tempered, and you know that if you fail a roll they might blow up in your face, and blame it on "looking at you funny" or maybe they just took something you said the wrong way? With go aggro, you're playing that guy. Or at least someone adopting that persona, I don't know. It's apocalypse world, you're playing someone who thinks that the best way to get someone to hand over the keys is to start beating them. Even if you say "I start beating them up, yelling 'where're the fucking keys?'" you're going aggro \u2013 look at the results. If you're not Hard enough, they might get away (for now), and they can always stop you by handing over the keys.<br/><br/>The way it sometimes sounds like go aggro works, it kicks in exactly at the point where you say "I step up to him, snapping my finger joints, saying 'where're the keys?', implying I'm gonna hit him". That's a cool situation too, and I guess it's resolved by go aggro, but... Sometimes it's not that clearly divided between threat, statement of intent and commitiment from the player. Sometimes you just go aggressive on them, start yelling and shooting at their feet, whatever.<br/><br/>I think modern people are sometimes too cerebral, forward-thinking and smart to appreciate what it means to go aggro. Then the move is hard to use, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425284/#Comment_425284" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T08:11:43+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  8:11AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To take a step back:<br/>With the go aggro move as written, what fictional narration by players would trigger such a move?<br/>It\u2019s so easy to say \u201cI shoot them\u201d and then it seems to me that the moment for \u201cgo aggro\u201d has passed.<br/>Instead, how should/could it look?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425303/#Comment_425303" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T09:45:31+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  9:45AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, "I shoot them" indicates that you're trying to kill them, and in that case, you're not going aggro--you're going for Harm. Unless you were shooting to cause pain.<br/><br/>Going aggro is about getting up in someone's space so that you can get something from them; that's coded into the results. You level some sort of violence at them (physical, social, whatever) and they have to stand up to you or get out. In a firefight situation, you don't go aggro to kill someone; you go aggro to blow them back and get to the door. <i>Hollowpoint</i> (to diverge slightly) makes a great point about firefight situations: they're not about killing people, they're about winning ground and aggressively advancing on your objective, leveling the threat of violence as a weapon.<br/><br/>When you Go Aggro, violence isn't the intended outcome, it's the tool. The intended outcome is that the other side yields. Here's the breakdown of the outcomes...<br/><br/>10+: you force the NPC to take action. They can't keep stalling. They either have to take the violence that you're leveling at them, or else cave and give you what they want. There's no safe option of "I weasel out of it unharmed".

SBF is used when they want to take something away from someone/something by force. <br/><br/>If you can just shoot/attack someone from hiding or anything then you are just dealing harm. If you pull your gun on a farmer then you just deal harm. When you pull your gun on a guard at the horny-leoppard then it is going aggro because they are trained/badass enough to be able to fight back. The fight back result of them is shown in the 7-9 result most of the times. <br/>If they just want to attack some a 10+ gives them then the chance to either suck it up, or do what they want - get hit in the face. <br/><br/>It is maybe not perfect but i think it can work.

It's counter intuitive.</blockquote>\nAll the moves work this way, when they affect NPCs. Manipulate works this way, for example: the player rolls, and then the NPC reacts. In both cases the move describes what sort of reactions are possible, and the possible reactions depend on the result of the roll.<br/>\n<blockquote> If you say, "I'm smashing his face into the bar."  Why do I have YOU roll to let ME decide to give you what you want or walk away with my hands up. It doesn't make sense as a move.  If a 10+ is keep doin' what your doin'... don't roll for it... do it.  If as a GM I want him at the last second to say, "OH GOD WAIT A MINUTE I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT!"  He STILL gets to do what he wants... be that bash his face into the bar or calm down and let the guy talk. Don't make a player roll to possibly have someone stop his action. </blockquote>\nWhy not? Maybe someone wants to stop his action? Maybe his action might not succeed completely? Maybe it will not have the results he wants? I mean, when a player rolls Seize by Force, it's quite possible someone might stop him from seizing what he wants: that's why you're rolling, to find out what happens.<br/>\n<blockquote>He either WANTS to bash his face in... or wants to THREATEN to bash his face in.  If he wants to bash the guys face in, a partial success turns it into a threat that he DOESN'T carry out. That's a terrible success.</blockquote>\nOr maybe he wants the NPC to talk and he's going to bash his face in if he doesn't? I mean that's kind of what the move is for: commitment to violence if the other person doesn't do X. <br/><br/>Some people have raised the possibility of using the move for straightforward acts of violence, but that's not its primary use. It's for acts of violent coercion. If there's no coercion at all, there might not be a move. <br/>\n<blockquote>Bottom line.  You get robbed of your intention by going aggro and having a partial success and a 10+ is either just a banal... do what you wanted to do in the first place, or NOW it's a threat you made and instead of you doing what you want you now CAN'T and the NPC gets to choose. </blockquote>\nI think you're getting a bit carried away, but in any case I don't really understand how you got to this. A 10+ means that either they do the thing the PC wants, i.e. they are coerced by impending violence, OR they are harmed because they are unwilling or unable to do the thing the PC wants. It's not really about whether the PC gets to do what they want or not, it's about how the NPC reacts to the PC's attempt.<br/><br/>I also am totally confused by the idea that a 7-9 result is robbing the PC of their intention. They wanted to get the NPC to do something -- now it turns out the NPC <i>is in fact</i> doing something, but it's maybe not exactly what they wanted. Sounds like a 7-9 result to me.<br/><br/>In any case I really don't understand what it is you think is happening otherwise, without this move. The move is there to arbitrate situations where a PC is trying to use violence to get someone else to do what the PC wants them to do. (It can also be used to deal with uncertain, one-sided acts of violence, but that seems to be confusing the issue for now.) You have suggested that you could just let the PC commit the act of violence -- but that doesn't actually resolve the situation. <br/><br/>A PC isn't Going Aggro to hurt someone, they are Going Aggro to get someone to do something. Saying "okay you slam their head onto the bar" is not addressing that intention at all. Simply allowing the violence to happen does not tell us what happens next, or how the NPC reacts. The move is there to structure the different ways an NPC will react to imminent violence, not the violence itself.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425308/#Comment_425308" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T11:31:53+00:00" title="December  5, 2013 11:31AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Carpeguitarrem">@Carpeguitarrem</a> At the same time, it says pretty clear that it's totally a thing to Go Aggro with "what I want him to do is fall down bleeding and die."

This can be counter-intuitive for many people used to other games, where the rolls is about what your character is doing and whether he succeeds in doing the action. It's a subtle distinction, but an important one. In OD&amp;D I roll a d20 to see if I successfully hit. I then roll a damage die to see the effect. In AW I'm going for the effect and roll for that immediately.<br/><br/>I also think the name for the move Go Aggro is... well, a tricky name. It puts the focus on being aggressive. Which it isn't. The focus is about doing something (usually aggressive) to get a result. <br/><br/>I think this which is why <i>Dungeon World</i> is a smoother fit for lots of people. Hack n' Slash is about aggressively doing harm. It takes the d20 and damage roll of D&amp;D and slips it into AW's dice mechanic. But it's actually a very different thing than how AW kind of runs.<br/><br/>Finally, in the threads above, Vincent suggests always looking at the possible outcomes for the Move rolls as a guideline for which move to use. This seems incredibly sound to me. Remember, we're guided by the fiction first in AW. If a result is offered that doesn't make sense for what is happening in the fiction, don't try to cram that result into the fiction. Either pick a different move if the possible results don't jibe with the fiction, or ignore result if the move made sense but some of the results don't fit.<br/><br/>The general consensus from the linked threads seems to be: "If you want to take a guy's life from him, it's Seize by Force. What you're seizing is his life." You succeed and you can do terrible harm. Depending on how well you do you can get other effects (suffer no harm from the opponent, terrify the opposition, and so forth.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425318/#Comment_425318" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T14:00:31+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  2:00PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Golux' question isn't about going aggro vs seizing by force, it's about going aggro vs seducing or manipulating. And it isn't about how the moves work, it's about why and whether to use going aggro at all, when you can manipulate someone with the threat of violence as your leverage.<br/><br/>The answer is that allowing the PC to inflict harm without making a move is always the MC's call, not guaranteed, not the player's to expect, demand, or insist upon.<br/><br/>If Golux, as MC, DOES reliably allow the PC to inflict harm without making a move, then he's deprecated going aggro as a move, and so be it.

Sorry, I should be a bit more clear. What's really happening in Daniel's example is the PC is seizing the NPC's body. Once he has that, he can dispose of it how he sees fit without having to make a move. But you can't choose to seize definite hold of that life you are trying to take (I mean, you <i>can</i>, but the game says you can't). It's just that in this instance, the wording of it didn't matter. The semantics of "I seize his life by force" didn't matter, because the fiction indicated what was actually being seized. Likewise, that phrase could also mean the same thing as "I try to kill him while he fights back" which is also what seize by force is for. It's when you get to choosing the option to "seize definite hold" of his life (as opposed to his body, or his tactical position, or his gun, or whatever) that you run into a problem.<br/><br/>The PC tries to grab the guy so he can kill him, the guy fights back. Seize by force. Once the PC chooses the option "seize definite hold" of the guy, the guy no longer has any options. If the PC kills him, it's not a move. He isn't fighting back (so it's not seize by force) because he can't fight back (so it's not go aggro). So yeah, we say "seize his life" but we really kinda mean something else. Or at least I thought that was in those threads? Anyway, I'm not saying it's badwrong and breaks the game and stuff, just that I seem to remember arriving at a consensus of it being sub-optimal to use "I seize his life by force" a lot.<br/><br/>How could it be more clear? Refinement of the language over time, I guess, either of rules or explanatory text. Violence in AW is really, really idiosyncratic. It's not like other games and it's not like a simple pass/fail "I do a thing, does it work?" It doesn't tend to translate well to other AW hacks, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425333/#Comment_425333" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T16:21:13+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  4:21PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To address the original post directly: In the playtest version, it seemed like just shooting a guy was never a move, so we played like that when we started.

That's what he prefers, that's what he's allowed to do. Strictly speaking, he's adding a custom move to the home front, even if he never bothers to write it down. </blockquote>\nVincent is right when he says that I require NO MOVE for violence and allow my players to inflict harm at will.  I am always unrelenting in that.  If they want to shoot the hardholder NPC why would I stop them or even want to see the fiction where they miss?  These characters haven't gotten to be THE Gunlugger or THE Chopper by missing their shots.<br/><br/>I would like to add the caveat that I certainly will require rolls for my players if there is some reasonable fiction that might cause something different than your standard BANG DEAD scenario.  That's what Acting Under Fire is for.  Sure... shooting that one dude isn't an issue.  But if it's a dude that's grappling with your friend that you don't want to hit... that's Acting Under Fire. Also... acting under fire has WAY better results on 7-9 for any violence move.  It's kinda a good rule of thumb anyway.  If I can't think of a reason that this PC is under some serious pressure.  They do it.   It's the same reason I don't have them roll to tie their shoe or open a door.<br/><br/>The GREAT thing about apocalypse world is that it evokes amazing stories and fiction.  These games in their ideal form should make great movies.  I don't want to see the movie where the gunlugger MISSES!  Let him hit and the consequences are the interesting part of the game... not his miss.  You may kill whoever you want.  But I always have MORE and BADDER things out there for people who think that because I let you hit every shot that it will solve every problem.<br/><br/>Conversely if you look at Dungeon World, it has Hack and Slash... but that's because it's not evoking a story or a genre of fiction.  It's ACTIVELY invoking D&amp;D... and in D&amp;D we roll to hit. You can't invoke D&amp;D without rolling to hit. So I read that and then went back to AW and said to myself, "Holy shit.  This game doesn't have a tohit roll. Because Going Aggro would not be the move to use if you wanted to shoot a Kobold so that's NOT a to hit move." <br/><br/>I thought a lot about what that meant to the game and to ME what that meant (and this shapes my apocalypse world quite a bit) is that the characters are F#!*ING FORCES OF NATURE.  YOU'RE THE GODDAMN GUNLUGGER.  When you decide to hurt someone we don't want to know IF it happens.  We want to know what the RESULT of that happening is.  <br/><br/>So I guess after hearing everyone here chime in about their AW experience and interpretation of the rules.  I take a significantly harder approach to violence in my AW.  Every once in a while I MIGHT step in and say, "before you pull the trigger Shiny screams, 'WAIT I KNOW WHO RATTED YOU OUT!'" and the fiction continues with them fully pulling the trigger or not. \n<blockquote>He's well within his rights to do it, and for my part, I don't know what he expects us to have to say about it at all!</blockquote>\nI mean no disrespect to Apocalypse World or Vincent with my question and as much as it is MY Apocalypse World the moment it hits the table I still want to understand the things in it and not just throw them away because I'm just not getting it which is why I started this thread.  That being said, I read Apocalypse world for the first time and it totally blew my mind as it really tied together all the things I'd been trying to do in my other games to make them great.  Then I ran it a bit and read Dungeon World and made my above revelation that AW doesn't have Hack and Slash.  So what I NOW get... is that the way I run AW now is a misconception of it's real design and what I play is really my bastard child of AW. (Albeit a rather violent and ruthless child that I love.)<br/><br/>As a side note... \n<blockquote>Strictly speaking, he's adding a custom move to the home front, even if he never bothers to write it down. </blockquote>\nI don't understand the custom move I'm using.  I want to write it down.<br/>\n<blockquote>To address the original post directly: In the playtest version, it seemed like just shooting a guy was never a move, so we played like that when we started.

The Gunlugger NEVER misses unless he's acting under fire.  Anticlimactic roles shouldn't be.  I can be anticlimactic without rules to tell me how to do it. Violence is ALWAYS effective... the effect has interesting outcomes. NPC's tend to react the same with bullets in their head. <br/><br/>What I now get... is that what Go Aggro is REALLY getting at is that in times of violence there is possibility of instead of just having violence happen, that the victim could (instead of being shot in the head) provide a new direction for narrative to follow.  I've always said that AW is just Good GM'ing the system and it only has a system to remind you to be a good GM.  A lot of things come naturally to me about AW and some don't.  I think that Go Aggro's Good GM'ing queue is to allow violence to take an unexpected turn. Noted. Instead of having the player roll for it and it providing me the queue.  I feel that I (and my players) would be better served with a more direct route to the PLAYERS desired action and I can insert my Go Aggro option if I want to. \n<blockquote>To take a step back:<br/>With the go aggro move as written, what fictional narration by players would trigger such a move?<br/>It\u2019s so easy to say \u201cI shoot them\u201d and then it seems to me that the moment for \u201cgo aggro\u201d has passed.<br/>Instead, how should/could it look?</blockquote>\nI think this was the original problem I had with the move.  A lot of the other moves are pretty clear when they are to be triggered but Go Aggro says, "When you go aggro on someone,"  It's self referential and so I went to the outcomes and the outcomes are certainly indicating a kind of purpose not just violence.  <br/><br/>My last two cents:  My Apocalypse World is different than it was written because of a supposition I made.  It turns out I like it this way and now I understand why Go Aggro doesn't make sense in my Apocalypse World.  My apologies to Vincient for deprecating his move.

Which one do we pick? It's an artistic decision.<br/><br/>"Ok, we've got someone pulling a knife, and it's a tense situation! What do we do next?" <br/><br/>The MC can simply make an MC move - sometimes, that fits best. (And "inflict harm" is one good option here! But so is "offer an opportunity and ask" or "ask a provocative question".)<br/><br/>The MC can ask to roll "go aggro", or "seize by force", or some other move. <br/><br/>The question to ask is: which move gives us the most interesting outcomes for this situation? Which "feels" the most right? (e.g. Seize by Force almost never feels right unless the opposition is positioned and ready to fight back, which is what John Harper gets at in his post about it being a peripheral move - not the way you want to do things in Apocalypse World!)<br/><br/>I don't think the game works very well if you treat it more mechanically, and just start rolling moves and *then* try to sort it out. "Well, do these outcomes make sense, or not?"<br/><br/>"Go Aggro" makes the most sense to me if I take the name of the move as literally as possible: "Going <i>aggro</i>." It's someone getting violent and aggressive on someone else! Don't use it for just a threat!<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>The gunlugger says he wants to slam the guy's face into the bar, unless he tells him some stuff. <br/><br/>MC: "Ok, so you're being all threatening and stuff? Roll go aggro."<br/><br/>Here, to me it's going to feel a little weird if we roll 7-9 or a miss, and equally weird if we roll 10+ and now the player feels like they have no choice but to "follow through", even though they haven't even taken any action yet. The character's action (grabbing the opponent and slamming their face in) hasn't even happened yet, so the 10+ result is kind of forcing the player's hand - why should the player have to decide before they even start doing anything whether they're bluffing or not?<br/><br/>I prefer it like this:<br/><br/>MC: "Oh, you're being all threatening and stuff? Well, he just sits there drinking, scoffs at you, but you can see his hand is shaking..."<br/><br/>PC: "Fucker. I grab him by the ponytail and slam his face into the bar!"<br/><br/>[Note: this is already happening now! The action has been initiated by the character, whether he manages to pull it all the way through to broken-nose-against-the-bar or not. But the character's in motion, he's taking action!]<br/><br/>MC: "Ouch! That's 1-harm... actually, wait a minute. Do you just want to hurt him to make a point, or are you trying to get something out of him?"<br/><br/>PC: "Oh, I want him to tell me where the girl is."<br/><br/>MC: "Ok, so you're clearly going aggro, grabbing the dude and smashing him into the bar! Let's roll."<br/><br/>The player rolls.<br/><br/>10+ - Some shit goes down, and the NPC now has to choose whether to suck it up or cave and tell. <br/><br/>Unless I can see how it's fictionally appropriate for that NOT to be the case, I'd imagine I'll being dealing harm to the NPC in either case here.<br/><br/>Either way, the player's got the upper hand here and the initiative afterwards. ("Now what do you do?")<br/><br/>He might even be able to repeat the move, with more severe consequences ("Now I'm strangling him!"), which usually isn't a good idea, but could really work here.<br/><br/>7-9 - Shit goes down, but the NPC might lie ("tell you what he thinks you want to hear"), try to bribe the player, or slip away in the process, if that seems believable.<br/><br/>Again, I'll probably be dealing harm here anyway, but I could see that not being the case in most situations.<br/><br/>Either way, the intimidation worked: the player's got the upper hand and the initiative. They've definitely won the fight (at least so far!), the enemy is cowed. <br/><br/>They're just not getting what they want out of it.<br/><br/>6 or less - Shit goes down, and the MC makes a move.<br/><br/>This could be good or bad, as far as the outcome of the violence goes.<br/><br/>If the NPC is totally badass, maybe they catch the PC off-guard and knock their teeth out first, instead. (But usually, I'm with Golux - the PCs are badasses in AW, if they initiate shit from a position of strength, they'll probably make a good show of force in my Apocalypse World. It would take a pretty unusual NPC to just flip the tables like that - or, more likely, the character taking action under not-so-ideal circumstances, like being surrounded by the dude's friends.)<br/><br/>"Trade harm for harm" is a good MC move here, too. ("Ok, you fight for a moment, both take 1-harm. He's totally pissed off. Now what?")<br/><br/>It could be something else, too, though, like the scuffle attracts unwanted attention and now it's time to run, or the PC hits the guy too hard and kills him by accident.<br/><br/>The point, though, is that at the end of it the player a) almost certainly doesn't have what they want (the information on the girl), and they don't have the initiative either: now the MC's making a move, which is probably bad news, and the player's got to react.<br/><br/>"Ok, you've got the guy by the ponytail and he's screaming, but everyone's crowding around you, looking for blood. Now what?"<br/><br/>"He goes limp after you slam him into the bar a couple of times, and he's not breathing. You still don't know where the girl is. Now what?"<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>I hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425647/#Comment_425647" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T22:47:22+00:00" title="December 10, 2013 10:47PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Example:<br/><br/>The gunlugger says he wants to slam the guy's face into the bar, unless he tells him some stuff. <br/><br/>MC: "Ok, so you're being all threatening and stuff?

However, that being said I don't want to stop a player every time they're commiting violence if they have intention.  That's their business.  The world doesn't work that way and neither does fiction.  If he's bashing someones face in for information and he's not shooting him in the face there will be plenty of time for discussion after head hits wood.  If so... ask away harm DONE. If he's shooting him in the face then we're not here for a discussion.<br/><br/>As a GM I believe that your motivation to even ASK, "Do you just want to hurt him to make a point, or are you trying to get something out of him?" is because YOU have an idea about what he might want to get out of the situation. I don't think it would be appropriate to stop a player from shooting someone in the face with a shotgun to ask the same question because the subtext of asking that question is that the player is <i>probably</i> not going to get that information if you shoot someone in the face with a shotgun.  So... I choose to do this:<br/>\n<blockquote>Your custom moves are straightforward. They're just as you say:<br/><br/>-A player can choose to have her PC inflict harm as established at will, just by "pulling the trigger."<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThey pull the trigger and harm is done, then we just proceed with Go Aggro as if it had been rolled and the NPC can whine and cry and beg or shoot back.  (Whatever is appropriate.)  I choose to deprecate the move and skip the role.  If the player intends to do harm they go for it... I can interrupt before they pull the trigger and offer something but the player can ALWAYS do the harm they want.<br/><br/>I think I'll keep the move around and parenthetically call it (Torture.) It makes sense as a torture move when using Pull the Trigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/donogh" title="donogh"><img alt="donogh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/donogh">donogh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425669/#Comment_425669" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-11T11:34:46+00:00" title="December 11, 2013 11:34AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really interesting discussion guys.

I just might do it and you're convinced.<br/><br/>If a player wants to rip someones arms off because that SOB needs to not have arms, then I'm not going to turn it into a manipulation roll after the fact.

It helps the engine along. For instance, shooting someone generally doesn't happen in a vacuum: generally, there will be a scene happening, and you'll have some sense of *why* the shooting is happening. Is the character scared, or acting under some kind of pressure (a ticking bomb, approaching enemies, etc)? Then it's probably acting under fire. Is the character being intimidating and trying to get something to go their way? Then it's probably go aggro. Or are they just shooting someone at their leisure, for fun? (A rare case, I would think...) Then just inflict harm, or make another MC move.<br/><br/>And if you don't know, ask more questions until you do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425830/#Comment_425830" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-16T08:01:01+00:00" title="December 16, 2013  8:01AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\u2019s just that I wish that the question had been asked before the gun\u2019s trigger was pulled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425833/#Comment_425833" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-16T08:49:55+00:00" title="December 16, 2013  8:49AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well then you take 1-2 steps back and go from there.

Or screw up?<br/><br/>Personally I don't buy in to the 'PCs are all infallible violence-badasses' premise that seems to work well for many people. You can roll Go Aggro when the PC initiates violence, and the 7-9 results can make sense, because <i>violence does not always happen as expected</i>. You pull your gun to shoot a guy and, hey, the guy reacts and gets behind cover -- that doesn't seem like an outrageous result to me. <br/><br/>If the fiction suggests that the only possible result is that you shoot the guy, then no move is required, sure, but the PC just saying 'I grab him and slam his head against the bar' does not actually mean that they do so. These are people who live in the Apocalypse: they are used to people trying to grab them and slam their heads into bars. They expect people to try and shoot them, or steal their stuff, or smash their face in, or whatever. And so they <i>react</i> to attempts to do so, and depending on the roll of the dice sometimes they react successfully. <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>This is not directed at anyone in particular, it just seems like the premise that PCs always get to initiate violence successfully -- which Vincent accurately identified as a custom move -- has become the baseline for the conversation about how Go Aggro works. It's really not, and personally I think it's a pretty terrible custom move.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425841/#Comment_425841" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-16T11:42:46+00:00" title="December 16, 2013 11:42AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree 100% IceCreamEmperor.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Powered by the Apocalypse] Confusion about Going Agro. - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19047/powered-by-the-apocalypse-confusion-about-going-agro/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Powered by the Apocalypse] Confusion about Going Agro. - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19047/powered-by-the-apocalypse-confusion-about-going-agro/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Player: &quot;I shoot the dork!&quot; MC: &quot;Cool but hold on!

A player announces a desire to carry out a certain action, and then we roll the dice and find whether they managed to do so fast enough/hard enough/quietly enough/before it's too late/etc.<br/><br/>Isn't this how most other RPGs work, too? <br/><br/>"I attack him!"<br/>"Ok, roll initiative..."<br/><br/>Now we roll some dice.<br/><br/>And, if you lose the initiative, well, it's quite possible that you'll never get to attack at all.<br/><br/>I don't really see this as some kind of quirk of Apocalypse World, personally.<br/><br/>In the case of go aggro it's just that it looks kind of like this:<br/><br/>10+ - You won initiative, and you won the fight, effectively.<br/>7-9 - You won initiative, but your attack missed. You're going first in the next round, though!<br/>miss - You probably lost the initiative, and something else happens. (Although the MC can choose to have you "go first" anyway, you've definitely lost the initiative go into the next action.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425879/#Comment_425879" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-17T10:29:49+00:00" title="December 17, 2013 10:29AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Player:<br/>MC: "Okay.

If the MC wants them to roll seize by force, he has to describe the dude trying not to die. He doesn't have to fight back though. He's not just pleading. He's also shrinking in his seat, and as the PC gets closer, probably sliding out of the seat. <br/><br/>I think, if you shoot someone in the face, you're trying to take their life. Just because they just sit there doesn't mean they are going to give up their life.

It seems like it's against the spirit of the move, somehow. But I know that's just a personal nitpick on my part.<br/><br/>So, I reworded it for my own comfort like so:<br/><br/>When you just want to shoot someone, what you *want* them to do is to sit still. So you bring up your gun (or whatever), and you threaten them with violence. If they cave in, they submit, they stop moving, they cower at your feet. And now you can decide to shoot them anyway.<br/><br/>So, on a 10+, either you shoot them now, or they submit to you and then you shoot them immediately afterwards.<br/><br/>Somehow, this some more, uh, hygienic/proper to me. The other version rubs me the wrong way, but this one works for me.<br/><br/>I don't think this disagrees with anything anyone's said here (especially Vincent). It's just a different way to think about it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425924/#Comment_425924" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-18T07:41:27+00:00" title="December 18, 2013  7:41AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>This is not directed at anyone in particular, it just seems like the premise that PCs always get to initiate violence successfully -- which Vincent accurately identified as a custom move -- has become the baseline for the conversation about how Go Aggro works. It's really not, and personally I think it's a pretty terrible custom move.<br/></blockquote>\nThen don't play with it.  I prefer my AW more about actions and their consequences.  I was confused about Go Aggro because I don't like using Go Aggro as the tohit move in AW.  I don't think missing is interesting.  I don't think that NPC's jumping under cover is interesting.  I think it's interesting that you wanted to shoot a guy in the face and the consequences of that action are more interesting than you rolling dice and not getting what you wanted.  You can think it's terrible and continue to run the game the way you want.  I didn't intend to tell people how they should play AW.  It's just how I do it.  My games are better for it with my style of GMing.  Your style might not work for my custom moves. That's ok.  It's not terrible... it's just not made for you.

You've got them exactly where you want them, they're shocked and surprised, etc - you can just pull the trigger and it's done. <br/><br/>-&gt; The MC makes a move - typically just "inflict harm" on the NPC, but it could be something else. This is how Apocalypse World always works in the absence of a written move taking precedence.<br/><br/>B.

An MC move is stated clearly in A. But for B and C: "They have a chance to get out of it..." and "They're ready for you, prepared to fight back..." both imply that the MC is specifically describing fictional content that drives the decision of what the Player is going to have his PC do next, which determines the move.<br/><br/>I want to throw light on B and C. Because as a friend of mine pointed out to me about this thread, these discussions keep dropping the MC Move part. Which matters, because AW isn't a task resolution system, right? You don't say, "I'm gong to do this thing and I'm going to roll dice to see if I successfully do this thing." <br/><br/>The system only makes sense in the context of conflict between characters. <br/>"I want to do this thing... [insert specific bit of physicalized fictional detail]..." <br/>"Well, this character is doing this [insert specific bit of physicalized fictional detail] in response to what you're doing..."<br/>"Well, fuck that, he isn't, I'm Going Aggro before he gets a chance to do that and doing [insert specific bit of physicalized fictional detail]..."<br/><br/>I'm typing all this, by the way, not as a sage dispensing wisdom, but as a man going, "Is this right?" Because I know I keep tripping over myself about how this system works. But I also know it <i>does</i> work. And when my friend pointed out the the element of the MC moves missing from the examples, I was like, "Oh, right. Like <i>Sorcerer</i>. The mechanics make almost no sense without a beat-by-beat breakdown of the fictional details that surround the rolling of dice. Without the MC moves coming from that end of the table there's no fucking way to roll the dice to begin with."

"You've got the drop on him, but he's going to be jumping behind that bar." <br/>C. "He hears you tell him to step out of the way. But he's just standing there, shotgun in hand, a sheen of sweat on his forehead. He's not budging, eyes focused and hard on you."<br/><br/>And then, if the Player says an action that requires a roll, we'll roll. ("To do it, do it.")<br/><br/>B. "Fuck it. I shoot him before he gets away."<br/>C. "I shoot, going for that door. He's getting out of my way -- one way or another."<br/><br/>And so now we're doing it.<br/><br/><br/>A few years ago I altered how I GM'd <i>Sorcerer</i>. I stopped picking up the dice first for rolls for the NPCs. I never initiated the conflict system myself. In other words, I would press and press and press the PCs -- in one way or another, soft or hard -- and everyone once in a while a Player would say, "Well, fuck no," and pick up dice. And then I knew we were in a conflict. <br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, this is much the way <i>Apocalypse World</i> works -- but more formalized since only the Players <i>can</i> pick up the dice. The MC uses the MC Moves -- again and again -- nudging the PCs with fictional details and positioning. The Players counter with their own Characters doing positioning. And every once in a while the Players take an action that activates a Move. And now the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>I was confused, I think, because I misread the MC Moves as things the MC goes to <i>after</i> the dice are rolled. But the text is clear: It's when the Players toss the Fiction-Ball to the MC. If the Player draws a weapon and tells the NPC to give him the map... that's the Player now waiting for me (the MC) to respond. What do I do? An MC Move. I put him on the spot: The guy he wants to surrender is jumping for cover behind the bar.<br/><br/>What does the Player have his Character do? Well, he could have him do any number of things. But if one of them is a Move, now we're rolling dice. If he says, "I'm shooting him before he gets away... I'm going Aggro on his ass."<br/><br/>(In the current example: A 10+ for the Character means the NPC sucks up a hit but leaps over the bar; or sees the gun pulled by the Character and decides trying to tear off right now isn't worth the risk... the GM decides.)<br/><br/>I'm assuming, then, the GM doesn't have to fish for the Players to make moves. The fictional back and forth should lead to the point where the Players end up declaring an action that prompt the dice to roll.

However, as John points out, sometimes the MC move isn't something that happens in the fiction, it's a player-to-player, at-the-table thing, like "offer an opportunity, with or without a cost" or "tell them the possible consequences and ask".<br/><br/>So, sometimes it's like you describe, but sometimes there might be some more communication first, like in John's examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426038/#Comment_426038" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T11:40:32+00:00" title="December 19, 2013 11:40AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2013 11:51AM by John_Harper.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher: Yes, fictional details, always. Short-hand in forum posts usually drops that out. You have it right.<br/><br/>I like to ask leading questions <i>(ask provocative questions and build on the answers)</i> so I say things like "You're following through anyway, yeah?" and "You don't eat shit from this asshole, do you?" -- which, to be clear, are questions addressed to the character, not a player-to-player thing -- but that's a bit tangential to what we're talking about.\n<blockquote>What does the Player have his Character do? Well, he could have him do any number of things. But if one of them is a Move, now we're rolling dice. If he says, "I'm shooting him before he gets away... I'm going Aggro on his ass."<br/><br/>I'm assuming, then, the GM doesn't have to fish for the Players to make moves. The fictional back and forth should lead to the point where the Players end up declaring an action that prompt the dice to roll. I don't have to say, "You're following through anyway, yeah?" because when I say what the NPC is doing, the Player is going to tell me what he's doing. Yes?</blockquote>\nYep, exactly so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426054/#Comment_426054" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T14:41:37+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  2:41PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To both previous posts: Yes, the GM can make clear opportunities and threats within the fiction of the moment. Part of what the GM has to do is make things clear. And it is precisely for this reason these are two good moves for the MC.<br/><br/>As for leaving the fictional details out in the examples: I didn't mean it as a criticism, per se. My only point is, once we start leaving out the details -- pinging back and forth between the Player and the MC -- that lead to a die roll, then we might be losing the clarity of how the game actually <i>works</i>.  It's a point I've been making for years, so I supposed I'm a bit stuck on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426065/#Comment_426065" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T21:21:46+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  9:21PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's an important point!
