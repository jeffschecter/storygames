"Play before play" - most of the significant choices you could make are made long before your character enters the playing world so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that probably sounds pretty horrible, right? But I LIKE that kind of play. In fact, I'm playing a game of this type right now (it's an online flash thingy, not an RPG, but still...) and it's been super awesome. Looking at what I have and trying to build death on wheels from it, building from a general idea to what a build should be able to do, testing it out and adjusting accordingly, getting new abilities to work with that increase the number of possible build combinations to ridiculous levels... My little munchkin heart is full of content.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying this game, I realized that there are fun ways and unfun ways to do 'play before play' type games, and I think there are some general principles here that it might be useful to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we go:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Ease of changing builds:</b> In the game I'm playing now, you don't really play a character - you play a pilot of a vehicle that you pull together from different parts, and the main abilities are associated not with you as a pilot, but with your car as a combination of parts available in your garage. This means that, when you get a new 'ability' in the form of a new part, you're: 1) not tied down to using it forever; 2) not stopped from taking different abilities/parts later on. Compare to: Welcome to level 2! Pick carefully between Slash, Stab, and Tickle, because what you pick will stay with you forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Low cost of failure:</b> When you lose a game and it's the end of everything, it's frustrating. When you lose a game and you can spring back to the same battle with a different build, a loss can be interesting in that it lets you see how your opposition works - and works succesfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>A paper for every rock:</b> There should be an easily identifiable counterstrategy for every strategy taken. This way, you don't get stuck in a single repetetive sequence of action, but instead get stuck in multiple repetetive sequences of action (never said play before play could be perfect, no?).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Variable challenges:</b> It's easy to create a build that will level all oppossition if you have good information about what you'll be facing in advance. Your rivals should have a fair chance of adapting to your strategies, and you should, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The right to decline:</b> For the game to be about skill in making the best build possible and not about getting the "best" stuff and using it to straightforwardly smash the opposition, it's extremelly useful if both parties involved get to choose whether to engage into the battle or not. This is probably the best way to ensure that the game is fair - that both parties involved have a chance to win that THEY think is good enough to risk it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure it's possible to make a roleplaying game under these principles... But I'm fairly certain that it wouldn't hurt to try.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270891/#Comment_270891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T05:02:03+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  5:02AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some elements of this really make me think about Japanese Role-playing VIDEOgames, a  la Final Fantasy... and even though the "role-playing" in such games is arguable, still there are some RPG elements (character growth and specialization led by the player, a big focus on the story and plot, and, since technology has been able to support it, ability to make choices and influence the  story...)<br><br>Anyway, i don't know about you, but i love such videogames, and i had fun in the past in playing tabletops RPGs that either were heavily centered on building a strong character, or could go that direction (Exalted above all). in the end, kicking asses in a gigantic way can be fun, if the game is not reduced to only that... <br><br>Actually, i think there's one big question involved: how does this interact with "real" roleplaying and storytelling? can a game with a strong "tactical" element that really pushes on perfect PC builds also yield  good stories? if no, why not?  which element of the game structure and nature makes good stroytelling impossible, and how can this  element be removed or reworked?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270897/#Comment_270897" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T06:28:41+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  6:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>Compare to: Welcome to level 2!

Assuming duels aren't to the death, but just for honor, to demonstrate expertise or gain reputation, or simple dispute resolution, you've got low cost of failure, variable opposition, and the right to decline all there, at least.

But every game will have its own particular pacing, be it to suit styles of the players, genre appropriateness, or a notion of balance--and the relative efficacy of survivability versus lethality is one of the bigger knobs to twiddle.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270960/#Comment_270960" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T11:26:38+00:00" title="May 13, 2010 11:26AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks David, that's exactly the sort of stuff I'd like to hear - 'cause in all honesty, I'm <i>really not sure</i> if these things I'm saying are really as important as I vaguelly feel they are, and the "nuh-uh" kind of input helps me refine that vague feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a question, though.

They could end for any number of reasons: run away faster than the aggressor; all opponents unconscious or dead; various special abilities (e.g. bind) that make fighting impossible for long enough to escape or talk it out.<br><br>The main point behind building GLASS with a defensive slant is to provide for more fluid and varied conflict/combats amongst folks with little actual martial skill (or, more so, amongst folks with varying actual ability to spar/shoot). One-hit kills, while realistic for the vast majority of weapons, don't make for very exciting combat--in fact, high-lethality systems tend to discourage combat significantly, especially with long-term plots and multiple sessions. So I build into GLASS the basic notion that it's cheaper (and therefore easier) to tool up on defense than offense.<br><br>But nothing grants invulnerability. Every paper has a rock, and even if you put every build point into Natural Armor and other defenses, you'd still only have AT BEST an order of magnitude more net "hit points" than someone who spent a handful of build points on defense (i.e. you could tool up to about 30 while a "normal" person has only 3, butt-naked). Testing might cause me to adjust costs a bit here and there, but I doubt I'd get away from the basic "defense is cheaper than offense" notion.<br>-----<br>I want to add one:<br><b>Only allow one side of an opposed dichotomy to scale</b> - Don't allow arms races: if one can increase damage output and defense equally, then an arms race ensues, which can cause significant imbalance between veteran players and new players, or which can narrow a players options in character design--e.g. "everyone MUST have at least 5 Damage reduction to even survive a round of combat" and similar localized, game-cultural trends (i.e. the "metagame").<br>(That's a very LARP-oriented notion, but it could apply to long-running table top games that admit new players from time to time.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
