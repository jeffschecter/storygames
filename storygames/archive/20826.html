How much of the world do the characters create by the GM's questioning? What types of things/scenes should the GM narrate and what should they leave up to the players? How can I get the most out of Lady Blackbird in a one-shot 3 hour session and what kind of adjustments do I need to make? What should I cut and what should I leave in? What other things do I need to know that would help to improve the game and make my GMing better? If you could give examples with your explanations I would be very grateful:) Any info or suggestions are greatly appreciated <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457216/#Comment_457216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T19:58:02+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  7:58PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There isn't really any hard and fast rule for "How much should I make up and how much should I 'farm out' to the players?"   I think the best answer is "If you have a totally awesome idea for something, you should use your totally awesome idea, and if you have no idea, you should ask someone else, and for everything in between, use your judgement." but that's not actually super helpful.  Unfortunately, I think this is an art rather than a science.<br/><br/>In terms of what to cut and leave in - well, Lady Blackbird doesn't have that much pre-existing stuff.  It gives you a starting situation, and some characters, mostly.  So where you "wrap" your session is largely up to you - escaping from the clutches of the imperials seems like a good place for that.  You probably won't have time to cover the rest of the journey and meeting Lady Blackbird's betrothed or whatnot. <br/><br/>In terms of general GMing advice, I recommend Adam Koebel's "Office Hours" videos, orginally on twitch but also generally archived to Youtube, but that's a lot of ground to cover before your game.  So view GMing as a learning experience. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> And keep copious notes about what happened and what you did and why.  The Angry GM suggests spending the "end of session" period where everyone is jawing about the game to write down what happened during the session, anything you need to improve on, etc.  I think that's good advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457217/#Comment_457217" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T20:00:14+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  8:00PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks so much <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The directions say not to plan, do you think this is a good idea or not?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457220/#Comment_457220" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-18T20:03:54+00:00" title="October 18, 2016  8:03PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There isn't really any hard and fast rule for "How much should I make up and how much should I 'farm out' to the players?"
