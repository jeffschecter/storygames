                    I've been looking over a lot of old gaming books lately--you know, the ones from the late 80's/early 90's, the whole D&amp;D Boxed Set thing, where there are 200 pages of "setting material" to use.  Dark Sun.  Dragonlance.  Planescape.  Nobilis.  Those settings are too dense!  <br/>
<br/>
In comparison, there's Sorcerer, which is a great game, but for the longest time I couldn't get into it because there's just not enough setting.  It was only after I made it all up that I realized how fun it could be.  Capes and Trollbabe are the same way--I think they need a lot of heavy thinking until there's a setting I'd like to game in.  Those settings are too skimpy!<br/>
<br/>
Then you have The Shadow of Yesterday, which has enough setting to seem enticing, but not so much that it's intimidating.  That setting is Just Right!  (I haven't read Dogs, but it sounds like it might be the same way.)<br/>
<br/>
Two Questions:<br/>
1.  Am I completely crazy, or is there something to the "some setting great, too much setting sucks" phenomenon?<br/>
<br/>
2.  If so, what does the Just Right amount include?  What doesn't it include?                </div>

I think that this might be best discussed in terms of setting material versus situation material versus color material.<br/>
<br/>
My preference is to have little to none of the first, some of the second, a massive amounts of the third.<br/>

                            Which kinda explains why I couldn't understand Dark Sun at first, but then after getting The Veiled Alliance, I really got into that setting.  The Veiled Alliance had a bunch of situation material ("Stuaff's a brewin' at the area Veiled Alliance"; a list of conspiracies, a list of town happenings, etc), and a fuckton of setting color (I finally understood that the city-states were analogues of ancient real-world cultures).                        </div>

What counts as setting material vs situation material in that scheme?<br/>
<br/>
I've been defining proper Setting for myself as "that which gives rise to Situation" and talking about it in terms of "hooks" to hang Situation off of. Am i crazy?                        </div>

Some do.  They want to discover all this stuff, and bitch if it's missing.<br/><br/>It's not my cup of tea personally, but it does exist.<br/><br/>I suspect they like the process of turning some of it into Situation, so if there isn't lots and lots Situation-free Setting to begin with, they feel deprived of choice on what gets imbued with Situation, and deprived of the opportunity to that tinkering they like.  But it's not my own preference so I'm speculating.                        </div>

<p>I've seen that preference before, and in my experience it works just as well or better if they pull the meaningless setting material out of thin air before imposing meaning on it. That might just have been a small subset of the setting-appreciating types, though, and there are people who <em>do</em> want the world laid out for them. Hm.</p>
<p>I dunno. It's all Cthulhu to me.</p>

                            I do know what you're talking about - I've found that the perfect combo for me is if there's only going to be a little setting material, for it all to either be color (I've always  referred to it as 'varnish' - it doesn't help the structure of the setting, but it makes it look purty) - and that way I can build the understructure for it (the setting material and the dynamics (i.e. 'situation')) any way that works best.  As you add more material, make it situational, and finally, if you can get someone to really care about the game's setting, start piling on the encyclopedia.<br/><br/>In general, I think that most folks want situation (what's there to *do* here), followed by color and then the dense stuff.<br/><br/>But I'm a worldbuilding junkie, so I'll take it just about any way you want to serve it up.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>As for those older settings, I think that the admixture was just a bit off.  Certainly <i>Planescape</i> - the only published setting I've ever used 'off the rack' - was very dense stuff, but it also gave you the situations right up front.  Most folks' problem with it is that the varnish was part of the <i>game text itself</i>.  Personally, I liked it.<br/><br/>Lord knows I'd never play in <i>Forgotten Realms</i> - there's no room for a DM to fucking breathe in that setting.                        </div>

                            Well, I'm a detailed-setting fan myself.  Classic Traveller, Jorune, Harn, and so forth are my speed.  Though even moreso, I like real-world settings because they have even more detail.  You can check books out of the library on them.  I ended up reading a big pile related to my Vinland campaign, including several sagas, non-fiction on the Icelanders, books on the local tribes of the Northeast, and also things like a book on the history of New York.  <br/>
<br/>
The simplest conclusion is that tastes differ, which is true but obvious and not very helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  Is there a different take on this?  I suspect it has something to do with how people work with other creative material.  I don't generally care about "adventure hooks" like the teapot ninjas or whatever.  Situations are easy and should flow from the characters anyhow.  What I like is someone having sat down and done the hard work of figuring out consistent background details, drawn the nice maps, and so forth.  I'm fine with no setting or lightly-detailed setting -- they're roughly the same to me.  Moderate setting I find a little more frustrating, though I guess my major beef is with settings which just haven't been thought out well of any sort.                        </div>

                            They make everything more meaningful, to me at least.  So, for example, my James Bond 007 game was set in the mid-1980s.  All of their espionage missions had intriguing irony to them played out from the context of 2005.  So it made it more interesting that they went to Kamal Khan's hideout near his homeland of Russian-occupied Afghanistan rather than in some fictionalized country.  <br/>
<br/>
Within the Harn game, it also makes a difference.  For example, my Harn character recently converted from Peonianism to Laranianism.  To me, switching out the Earth Goddess to the Warrior Goddess in most games religions would be dull.  i.e. I erase the "Deity" box on the character sheet and write in a new one.  In Harn, though, I have a better picture of the religions as cultural forces.  Peoni and Larani are tied in ways that other religions are not  -- both of them are part of the Emelrene culture, and their holy writings are both in Emela.  Save-K'nor also has it's seat in Emelrene, but it is foreign in origin, having come from the Azeri highlands.  <br/>
<br/>
Having the detail means gives multi-layered context to all the characters and events of the game.  So they can be interpreted at different levels and reflected on.                        </div>

The thing that major chunks of setting give me is firewood, basically.  I've torn bits and pieces out of a lot of different settings in order to cobble together my own with a bit less work on the GM end of things.<br/><br/>So, 200+ pages of setting is good.  200+ pages of setting that I have to read *all* of is bad.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's a trick I'd like to learn. To be able to take parts of setting and run with it.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I've got an upcoming one-on-one game with my friend Jonas, a game of conspiracy and dark intrigue set in Waterdeep (we're using Fate), and we've discussed a lot of how we can use the cool stuff in a comfortable way.<br/>
<br/>
The collaborative nature of the set up and the fact that none of us is really familiar with the Realms and got no problem with chucking out the cheesy parts has probably been a big help in approaching this game.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to see this as kind of an exercise in how to not be so intimidated by dense settings in the future.                        </div>

I wish I had enough sense to think of that distinction.  Most of the "boxed sets" I remember were *awesome* conceptually, but all of the Situation stuff was largely absent.  I think this is what makes GM'ing those games so difficult: you have to devise an interesting Situation all by yourself.  <br/><br/>The "boxed sets" themselves can be ripped away to maybe 1000 words of "look &amp; feel," which is all they're good for in my opinion.<br/><br/>Also, vaguely on topic: no game text should have fiction snippets or story-things --unless they're snippets from actual novels/movies/source material.  On the other hand, quotes from play are good.                        </div>

                            I love Setting. As a GM, I love both creating it and presenting it to the players (material, situation and color, hat and all). As a player, I love to play around in it, discovering what's hidden behind the Tall Mountains and who's plotting against who. As such, this is a major point for me - I pick games by it.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, since I enjoy writing my own settings more then using ones that are prepared for me, you'd think that I'd be a fan of minimal prepared setting. I thought I'd be too. I've found, though, that starting from scratch takes more energy then I'm willing to expand on every game, or on a regular basis. I want something to get me started, point me in the right direction and send my mind zooming down the lanes of writing the setting.<br/>
<br/>
I say minimal material, and almost all of it should be tied into the situation material, of which there should be considerably more. And massive amount of color. *Massive*.                        </div>

                            I actually think that it's "color" that's the problem for me--that so-and-so wears clothes of such-and-such, stitched by somebody-else.  <br/>
<br/>
I mean, here's the Setting you need to play "Dark Sun," one of the AD&amp;D 2e boxed sets from around 1991: there's this blasted, desert environment where almost nothing grows.  The landscape is inhabited by ferocious tribesmen, horrifically mutated beasts, and (very rarely) a hard-scrabble village.  And there are also enormous, hive-like cities bustling with slaves, gladiators, decadent merchant-princes, and the secret police of the God-Kings.  <br/>
<br/>
Like, I don't think it needs "color" per se.  You just need a feel for what the color would be, if it existed.  Guidelines, rather than descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that's purely my own estimation of my needs.  YMMV.                        </div>

                            James, just a cute vignette on what you wrote above:
<blockquote>The "boxed sets" themselves can be ripped away to maybe 1000 words of "look &amp; feel," which is all they're good for in my opinion.</blockquote>
Here's two examples I think that show off the difference between Setting material and Situation material, using classic D&amp;D examples:<br/><br/>Anyone remember this?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://home.flash.net/~brenfrow/fr/fradv.jpg"/><br/><br/>It was almost, but not quite, complete shit.  I didn't know it at the time, I just remember that:<br/>1) I liked the pretty pictures.<br/>1a) Particularly of the Clerics of the various gods, and the clothes that they wore.<br/>2) But otherwise, the book wasn't interesting at all.<br/>All it was was literally an atlas-guide of various cities and the like. The primary exports of Zhentil Keep. The annual mean income of families in Hillsfar. Shit like that.<br/><br/>Compare that to this, for those that looked into it:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://home.flash.net/~brenfrow/fr/frbox3.jpg"/><br/><br/>This boxed set came out much later in the 2E years, shortly before the collapse of TSR IIRC.  Anyway, I dunno who wrote it, but they wrote the whole damn thing pretty much with situation in mind.  I remember being <i>blown away</i> by this boxed set, because it would give you like one column of "atlas-style" listings for various places, then follow it up immediately with about a full page of nothing but adventure/campaign ideas, hooks ("rumors") and the like for each geographical or themed region.  One of the books that the game came with was basically a mini-campaign, rolled into several situation-pregnant ideas for what to do next based on what happened in the scenario. It basically took the most milquetoast campaign setting for D&amp;D and turned it into something edgy, with plenty of opportunities to engage in interesting stories and the like.<br/><br/>So, even back in the 'old days' some folks really took situation and really ran with it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<br/>
There was another grey boxed set between these two that I think is my all time favorite setting bit.  It gave you this calendar over like three years right and each month had shit going on.  All situation, like drow bodies found in the river and rumours of a war between theives guilds.  That shit was/is great in its approach as it gives everyone at the table something to invest in.<br/>
<br/>
I mean I love setting material.  That shit sucks me in, but it only works in game if everyone at the table can invest in it, which comes two ways.  In the more traditional way, everyone just groks on a part of the history or world or whatever.  In the more non-traditional way there are mechanics to allow players to bring shit into the game they want to invest in (Destiny Points in CoS and Lore Sheets in WotG are two examples of this).                        </div>

                            Mostly I'm answering the second question, as the first question has been handily answered with Ben's setting/situation/color distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
I approach the book as a set of instructions -- explicit and implicit -- to guide the players in playing the game.  As such, my Setting chapters are all first-person narratives with the Color dial ratcheted to 11.  Generally speaking, the Setting presented actually has very few actual, crunchy details; if you look deeper, it's all flash and bang Color.  Each segment comprises a different Situation that might arise in play (although I don't ever expect anyone to actually play those situations, as I have other situation creation rules provided).  So my "setting" chapters are actually 75% Color, 20% (unusable) Situation, and maybe 5% Setting.  The important thing, though, is that it all (should) read more or less like people playing the game -- it's all examples, suggestions, and demonstrations of how to develop your own roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
The thing of it is, what you need in actual play is a Situation to address and Color to express that address.  You can try to build Situation out of provided Setting details, but this runs into the problem that the Setting may not provide all the needed pieces or have pieces that conflict or subvert the Situation you're trying to create.  I find it much more useful to create a Situation from player flags and then flesh out a Setting that that Situation might arise out of.  As for the Color, I favor games that are incredibly loose with "canonical" Color and allow players to make up their own willy-nilly -- in which case all you need to provide in the book are guidelines and suggestions.                        </div>

                            Well, I don't know anything about the Forgotten Realms, so I can't comment directly.  For the most part, I'm uninterested in settings which read like they're full of "adventures" and "adventurers".  I like a setting where I can picture what real life is like for the people in the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Settings I liked muchly: Aberrant, Amber, Ars Magica, GURPS Goblins, GURPS Voodoo, Harn, Jorune, Paranoia, Puppetland<br/>
<br/>
Settings I didn't like so much: 7th Sea, Blue Rose, Castle Falkenstein, Code of Unaris, Riddle of Steel<br/>
<br/>
Do you intersect at any of these?  Agree or disagree, maybe we could compare what they're like?                        </div>

                            ALSO - NAMES.  The one piece of color that really matters (to me).  If you're going to list meaningless stuff about your imaginary society, at least give players a list of a few dozen sample names which do not totally suck.  I am so tired of Bad Fantasy Name Syndrome!  I took a look at Wizards' "Eberron" setting, and it's page after page of BFNS. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that whole "exports X and imports Y, and what % of the population is Fantasy Race Z" trend is god-awful.  I wonder how many people spend money on books like that, and how I can convince them to waste the money on me instead: I'll write a Java applet that churns out meaningless statistics and Bad Fantasy Names, and they can use it for $0.01 a hit.                        </div>

                            Settings where I would admit you really need lots of information: <br/>

* Ars Magica - medieval Europe is awesome, but to appreciate just how awesome it is, you need to read a lot of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
* GURPS Transhuman Space - this thing is so different, on just about every level, that you need a big book to learn about it.  On the other hand, absolutely no Situation is provided, with the result that the game looks cool but is almost impossible to play.<br/>

                            My answer to the original question two is that the Right Amount doesn't include too much Setting that can't become Situation.  Perhaps especially for those people who like lots of Setting so they can turn it into Situation?  I think this may also feed into the consistency issue.  Inconsistency can make it harder to turn Setting into Situation through the progress of the game, and if people are enjoying that process of imbuing existing fictional objects with their own meaning, a threat to that is a threat to their fun.<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually seeing this at the moment in a game I've started running, so my ideas are very much in formation.  But simply writing that paragraph above helps me to understand stuff that didn't quite work last week, and how I might have handled it differently.                        </div>

                            I've definitely come to realize too much setting doesn't work. But setting definitely also needs situation. My take on various settings:<br/>
<br/>
Glorantha: this was cool when I mostly relied on Cults of Prax and Cults of Terror, plus various maps. Now I look at my &gt;1 shelf of Glorantha stuff, and wonder if I could ever run it again. There wasn't a lot of situation in my early stuff, though there was the ever present Lunar/Orlanth tension, but I never really played that, Apple Lane and Snake Pipe Hollow provided some good situation though.<br/>
<br/>
Tekumel: Lots of grand detail. Too elegant. Didn't work. Definitely not enough situation.<br/>
<br/>
Diamond Throne (Arcana Unearthed/Evolved): Almost no detail. Almost no situation. Might as well have not been in the books. In my first campaign, by the time I dug up one possible situation, one player's background already contradicted my idea of situation (that the Mojh were against the Giants - PC was a Mojh who had become a Mojh in some way to protect a Giant).<br/>
<br/>
Blackmoor: I'm running my 2nd Cold Iron campaign in this setting. Very little detail in the original materials. Not a huge amount of situation. Mostly provided a neat map to build my own setting on top of.<br/>
<br/>
Harn: Too much detail. Not enough situation, at least not that I could recognize back in those days. Mostly flopped because Cold Iron just didn't match the setting well (though the campaign actually was quite fun - it just really didn't make much use of the setting, and setting stuff kinda got all messed up by PCs playing clerics and followers of the "more or less evil" deities).<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, I've certainly got a keen eye for what I want out of a setting. I don't want a huge amount of detail, though I would want more detail for a sim game (Glorantha worked really nice for sim). I would expect the setting to be relevant to the game, so for gamist, kill things and get treasure, Cold Iron, I mostly want a map that has wild places to go find monsters in, provide religions that adventuring clerics would follow and gain cool spells from. Dogs has a perfect setting for it's game (though I've tossed around the idea of a fantasy setting, and replace gunslinging with magic or something - though that might blur things with demonic influence and such).<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about this makes me realize now one of the things that I always look for when I look for a module to inspire adventures (I use D&amp;D modules all the time in Cold Iron and Rune Quest). I'm looking for situation that fits my play style - and I think I did actually look for somewhat differnt moduels in that sim RQ campaign than I used in gamist Cold Iron.<br/>
