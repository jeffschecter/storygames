That's great, actually, because a better understanding of the rules promises to make for better gameplay.  I could go into more detail about this, but what I want to talk about here is the very specific rules of conflict in Bringing Down The Pain.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3003#Item_9" rel="nofollow">Over here</a> Clinton pointed out that Jason (and the rest of our group) have been framing conflicts in an unexpected way.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite><br/>In TSOY, Jason was running a Bringing Down the Pain, and he did something totally strange to me: he determined whether a conflict was parallel or perpendicular by whether the abilities being used were associated with the same pool or not. It's not a bad rule, though, and it didn't really screw anything up.<br/></blockquote>\nIn the text of the rules, it says \n<blockquote><br/><i>Perpendicular </i>actions get in the way of each other. If Violet's action is to stab Lore with a spear and Lore's action is to trip up Violet, these actions are perpendicular. They're fighting each other, and part of that is keeping advantage.<br/><br/><i>Parallel </i>actions do not necessarily get in the way of each other. Let's say Violet is trying to convince Lore to join her ragtag group of misfits. Lore would rather her shut up and is cooking her dinner, hoping the smell of his righteous cooking distracts her. Both of these people can do this at the same time, and the winner will definitely have an effect on the loser, but as far as actions go, they don't get in the way of each other.<br/></blockquote>\nSo, my question:  What examples do folks have of conflicts that fall into each of these categories?  What kinds of conflicts stand out as clearly parallel or clearly perpendicular?<br/><br/>I suspect that perpendicular conflicts are easy for most folks to imagine- two characters in a knife fight, each wanting to disable/kill the other without themselves being killed.   It's harder for me to imagine reasonable parallel conflicts, so I'm interested in seeing what others come up with.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75121/#Comment_75121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T08:59:45+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  8:59AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2007 9:00AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bonus Question:  In your example conflict, what effect does the Harm each character takes have?

Last week we had this one:<br/><br/>Sarah, an alchemist, is approached by the representatives of three different factions in her capacity as cook in the kitchen at a house where a dinner party is being held. Vicaro wants her to mix a love potion to win the love of La Fiamenta. Carmello wants her to make him a powerful perfume that will enable him to outshine Garibaldi and win La Fiamenta's affection. Garibalid wants a poison to do in Carmello.<br/><br/>So we ran it as a conflict where everyone was parallel to Sarah and perpendicular to each other. Anyone who was beaten by Sarah got whatever alchemical mixture she wanted them to get, none the wiser. ANyone who beat her was too shrewd to be fooled and got what they wanted.<br/><br/>We've had a lot of success combingin parallel and perpendicular in the same conflict this way. Once you get the hang of it (which took us a while), you realize you can encapsulate practically any mix of events in one conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75136/#Comment_75136" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T09:47:26+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  9:47AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2007 9:49AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The simplest parallel conflict is words vs. steel. Marcus wants to stab Julian while Julian tries to talk Marcus into joining the faith. Marcus's attacks don't keep Julian from talking, and Julian's words can't stop Marcus's knife -- until one of them wins, of course.<br/><br/>Interpreting Harm is another TSOY trick that takes practice. There are usually several ways to describe it depending on the feel you're going for. I bet you've felt Reason harm from a great meal. You know that feeling you get after you have a fantastic, rich, meal? Sort of pleasantly bloated and euphoric? That could be harm. Imagine having to run away from a wild dog while in that state. You're probably a little impaired.<br/><br/>EDIT: I meant to say that a fight can also be parallel. Imagine two warriors who are not afraid to die. They both rush in without thought to defense and go for the killing blow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75141/#Comment_75141" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T10:13:13+00:00" title="June 12, 2007 10:13AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2007 10:13AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John- that final example is the best parallel conflict I was able to come up with as well- two combatants who want their opponent dead, with no regard for their own safety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75151/#Comment_75151" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T10:58:33+00:00" title="June 12, 2007 10:58AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate not to use AP from my own game, but <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2845#Item_1" rel="nofollow">this</a> is much better:<br/><br/>Jason has played a game wherein a character was Swaying a hurricane to stop, while the hurricane beat on his body.

In that conflict we had Scrapping (the courtesan)  going against Etiquette (the nephew) as a perpendicular set of tests (this was derived from the description in the free phase). <br/><br/>In a second bdtp, the courtesan tried to re-light her noble benefactor's fire, which was a lot of seduction vs. etiquette as well.

TSoY is one of the games that might be our next campaign (we're still haggling), and this brings up the one element of the system that i'm really not comfortable with, and was gonna ask about, so i'll chime in here:<br/><br/>I'm really unclear about what differentiates parallel and perpendicular actions. The fact that the examples given in the book, and the definitions of the two, don't jibe, is my primary problem. Is it just, as segedy says, a matter of how the group, the GM, or the players involved, describe it?<br/><br/>Why can you both succeed or both fail at persuading (the essence of the cooking/convincing example), but i can't succeed in tripping you at the same time you succeed in stabbing me? Now, sure, "I stab her" "i block the strike" are clearly perpendicular. But what are essentially two attacks? What am i missing? Are these just poor examples?<br/><br/>See, unlike segedy, i can easily imagine parallel actions, it's coming up with perpendicular actions that aren't just "i do X" "i avoid/ignore/stop/resist X" that i have trouble with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75371/#Comment_75371" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T10:30:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 10:30AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, that's interesting.

For example, two characters using "fight" skills- brawling and spear, for example- are directly opposed.  Likewise two characters haggling over the price of a necklace would also have a perpendicular conflict.  On the other hand, someone fighting and someone doing acrobatics-monkeying up a tree to get advantage, for example- are doing a parallel conflict, even though both abilities are Vigor based.<br/><br/>This is similar to the Pool vs. Pool idea, but it's a bit more flexible in definition.

An example from this past Monday...<br/><br/>Zhou Aolie, self-proclaimed emperor of China, is trying to keep Wenli (loyal emmissary of the Yuan dynasty) from getting out of the building and revealing to her bandit army that their new emperor is a woman. The two of them are clearly perpendicular: Wenli wants out, Aolie wants to keep him in.<br/><br/>So how about Wenli's lieutenant, Zhen Zhi? Well, his basic options were 1) act perpendicular to Aolie by primarily attempting to keep her distracted from fully stopping Wenli, probably adding his successes as bonus dice to Wenli's perpendicular roll, or 2) Not get conceptually involved in the Aolie/Wenli conflict, and just try to take Aolie down as fast as possible, Aolie is clearly not trying to stop him, being focused on Wenli, so Zhi is parallel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75403/#Comment_75403" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T11:22:53+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 11:22AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>I was just coming to a similar conclusion, though I still think there's room for similar actions to be parallel for dramatic and narrative purposes.<br/><br/>I think one reason this perspective is not immediately obvious is that it requires a third level of interpretation of the situation, one that isn't well-addressed in the text. <br/><br/>At the high level, you have the general intent: "kill the enemy" or "get into the castle without arousing suspicion". At the most granular, you have this round's immediate action: "I'm going to knock the sword out of his hand", or "I avoid making eye contact with the guards as I shuffle past the outer gate".<br/><br/>Somewhere in between, you have a more general plan of action, and I tend to use that to determine parallel vs. perpendicular. "I'm fighting my enemy" is a good candidate for perpendicular actions, if he's fighting back. "I'm fighting my enemy with reckless disregard for my own safety" is a sign that you're going for parallel, though I think it would require consent from the opponent. If he frames his fighty action in primarily defensive terms, he could push it back to perpendicular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75446/#Comment_75446" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T13:03:32+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  1:03PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2007 1:04PM by John_Harper.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, that's it Albert.<br/><br/>My advice is not to think about this too hard. We usually just go, "Oh, let's do parallel!" and everyone winces at the extreme pain about to come down and off we go. You really, really <b>don't</b> need to be consistent. One time, a knife fight can be parallel -- both guys are desperate madmen stabbing like crazy. The next time, it's more cagey, so the knife fight is perpendicular.<br/><br/>Use the one that feels right and that the group wants to do. The fictional actions taken can be a secondary consideration, really. The conflict type doesn't have to "model" anything. They're just tools for making the type of conflict you want right now: reckless or safe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75462/#Comment_75462" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T13:36:14+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  1:36PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks folks- I appreciate all the responses.

I'm think of something like this:<br/><br/>The Sorcerer is holding up the Skull of Flaming Death, and preparing to unleash its insane power on a group of helpless victims sitting in a cage.<br/><br/>The Mighty Warrior wants to rush the Sorcerer and take him out before the Sorcerer can do this.<br/><br/>The idea is:<br/><br/>The Warrior's action, if successful, should block the Sorcerer's action. He knocks him down, the Sorcerer suffers harm, no one is burnt.<br/><br/>The Sorcerer's action, however, could succeed without doing any harm to the Warrior: the Warrior knocks him down and deals some harm, but the Sorcerer still burned some victims.<br/><br/>Maybe a clearer example:<br/><br/>A swordsman is fighting an opponent armed with a bow at close quarters. The players like the idea that it's possible for:<br/><br/>-The swordsman to overtake his opponent before he gets a shot at him.<br/>-The archer to stick the swordsman with an arrow, dealing harm, but still get overrun and beaten into the ground (if the swordsman is not brought down by the arrow).<br/><br/>Hmmm. These are not very good examples, now that I read them over. But I'm going to leave them, and my question, and hope to get some replies from folks with TSoY experience.<br/><br/>Followup question: If you think this could work, how could we handle it at the table without leaving one person feeling angry and unfairly treated?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138063/#Comment_138063" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T23:57:05+00:00" title="April  3, 2008 11:57PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the mode of a volley is open to negotiation, I don't see why a given group couldn't decide on having asymmetric modes (by modes, I mean perpendicular/parallel/unrelated).<br/><br/>Going to your examples: <br/><br/>a) You seem to have negotiated that running over the sorcerer is enough to interrupt the spell, if the running over is bad enough for the sorcerer to suffer. Sounds like perpendicular to me, with the successes of the warrior effectively being a difficulty for the sorcerer to overcome. In the negotiation of outcomes, you could still agree that the sorcerer suffers harm according to the success level of the warrior, which in addition substracts from the sorcerer's success levels regarding the spell.
