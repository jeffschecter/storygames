This makes me want to avoid gaming, especially with people I don't know that well. I don't want to spoil anyone's game; people come to play, not to watch me implode.<br/><br/>I'm very grateful that there are still some games where I'm still welcome. When I'm gaming, I can keep a lot of that stuff away, and the social contact definitely helps.

(When I was a kid there was just "hyperactivity", and I wasn't hyperactive; so any problems I had were just absent-mindedness or procrastination or laziness...)<br/><br/>I really enjoyed D&amp;D in high school, but I tended to space out after a while during our all-day weekend game-athons, lose track of what was going on, and would often spend the later part of a session reading a book instead of contributing. I didn't game much after high school, except briefly in one campaign with some co-workers, where I again had trouble keeping up.<br/><br/>I've been treating the disorder for a couple of years now, with dexedrine and counseling and some neurofeedback. That's been helpful in general, though not a silver bullet. <br/><br/>I just recently got back into roleplaying, starting last fall, and it's going a lot better \u2014 I keep my concentration, stay involved, and I think I'm making a fair contribution. (It's not all due to the treatment, though \u2014 it helps that this is a smaller group (four players plus GM), more focused on roleplaying instead of interminable dungeon battles, and of course I'm older.)<br/><br/>I'm happy about this, and even considering giving GM'ing a try once our current campaign is over. (I love the creative aspects of GM'ing, but I've never been confident of being able to keep track of all the information and make things up on the fly.)<br/><br/>I know that ADHD is pretty common in geeks of all stripes. Asperger's is unfortunately common too (my son has a bit of it.) They seem to be intertwined with the more positive curiosity/creativity/deep-focus traits. I could see roleplaying being really helpful for people with autistic tendencies develop their social skills by working through imaginary scenarios; although it's likely to be frustrating sometimes for people playing with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince" title="Irishvince"><img alt="Irishvince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/464/n77MQHB4WLBHG.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irishvince">Irishvince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251266/#Comment_251266" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T11:20:37+00:00" title="January 18, 2010 11:20AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really a mental illness, but i remember when I was a teenager having intense anxiety attack before going to bed ( I would mostly thinking about how I hard it was for me to fit in, etc...

I stopped gaming with that group (this was icing on the social-problems cake that i was already biting into) and voil\xe0, no more problem.<br/><br/>i too get depressed, and don't mean to undermine the power of depression or its terrible effects on the lives of my friends when i say that many of the people i game with get depressed. Part of our friendships are helping one another through that, away from the table. Since gaming is generally a time which brings me joy (even as my characters are going through their own despondency or catharsis), depression doesn't generally affect me at the table. Perhaps i am too blind to see how it affects my friends at the table, mostly i think our depressions stop us from getting to the table in the first place, so it becomes a bit moot.<br/><br/>in response to your second post, Ry, if i may - i don't come to the table <i>exclusively</i> to play. I mostly play rpgs to connect with my friends. This means collaborating with them on imaginative fictions, this also means getting to know one another and our motivations and our experiences and our burdens better. I feel honored when another person evidences emotion around me. And certainly there have been times when my best friend / lover's great sorrow has gotten me down, but for the most part i am thankful that it's not more difficult that it is, that it's not as hard for me as it used to be to get out of my own darkness because i've got the scope to recognize that it'll pass again, that it always has so far, it always does.<br/><br/>hope that was welcome &amp; not over-stepping boundaries, i know it's a little off OT.<br/><br/><br/>(...oh, i suppose, on a second thought, that i've encountered lots of socially maladjusted behaviors at the table, and i don't know enough about what is defined as "mental illness" to ascertain whether that was mental illness that caused him to run from the room, screaming that he wasn't coming back after the DM had calmly instructed him to stop arguing the toughness of Red Dragons based on the rules in the Monster Manual because this wasn't the same type of Red Dragon anyway. His response was so over-the-top that i thought he was joking, but he didn't return. What is mental health? It all seems so muddy to me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251284/#Comment_251284" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T14:03:26+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  2:03PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2010 2:06PM by Ry.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: snej</cite>I could see roleplaying being really helpful for people with autistic tendencies develop their social skills by working through imaginary scenarios; although it's likely to be frustrating sometimes for people playing with them.</blockquote>I think more broadly gaming with people who are going through any kind of illness is hard.  Frankly, I can sympathize with people who have kicked someone out of their group for being a constant disruption. Heck, I don't like gaming with people who have poor English, with very heavy accents - again, not their fault, but it can degrade the game when people can't communicate, just like me and depression.<br/><br/>I'm not disruptive, even when I'm severely depressed, but I there's a very delicate line here.  On one side there's being sympathetic to a person who's experiencing difficulties they can't control.  On the other side is a fun and satisfying game night - where everyone is pulling their weight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251286/#Comment_251286" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T14:38:51+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  2:38PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got very depressed in my teenage years, to the point of serious thoughts of suicide. I used RPG's as a means of training my thoughts and personality. I would use it as an opportunity to pretend I already had the kind of personality I wanted to have, and after a while, I didn't have to pretend anymore, I really <em>did</em> have that personality.<br/><br/>Today, my wife suffers from some really powerful depression, and so I've tried to structure our games to address her issues, hoping that they might help her the way they helped me. Right now, for instance, she plays a sorceress in our D&amp;D game who already has immense power, but fears letting it loose, because the last time she did, it hurt a lot of people. My hope is that things like this will allow her to dramatize and mythologize her issues, and by working them out through a fictional character, allow her to work them out for herself: when Liora becomes comfortable with her magic power, maybe she'll become comfortable with herself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that so far hasn't worked out as much as I'd hope so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251289/#Comment_251289" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T16:05:33+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  4:05PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's this story I'd like to tell, and I think this might be the right place for it.<br/>If not, apologies.<br/><br/>I am a community support worker.<br/>That means I support adults with disabilities (developmental disabilities and physical disabilities, though many also deal with mental health issues).<br/>The way that I currently explain my job to friends: I get paid to hang out with people, support them in leading an active life, and not freak out about their shit.<br/><br/>Currently, as part of my job, I'm expected to larp Star Trek.<br/>I support a young gentleman who is quite mobile but dealing with a lot of behavioral and mental illness challenges.<br/>His favourite pastime is to pretend that he's participating in an episode of Star Trek.<br/>He's never heard the word "larp" in his life, but that's exactly what he does... he pretends he's various members of the crew of Star Trek (The Next Generation), and introduces various conflicts (Borg hijinx are the most common, followed by Romulans accidentally firing on Federation ships)... which then need to be overcome by the two of us. He expects me to address him in character. His CA is pretty simulationist, and I am frequently corrected about how things are actually done in the Star Trek universe. Though, at the same time, there's cross-over with the Harry Potter universe, which is inexplicable save for the fact that he also likes Harry Potter, so it was a natural move to combine them.<br/><br/>He has a much different social radar than I do, and thus feels no compunction to stop playing while in subways, on busy street corners, or passing by a school. It's been a big challenge for me... I realize that even though I talk and think constantly about roleplaying games, and have even spent time promoting public gaming events, I'm amazingly gun-shy compared to this guy. He has no problem exclaiming "Damn it, the Borg have triggered a dimensional portal into the mirror universe! Now we're going to have to fight our evil twins!" in public. And I feel like a dork because I'm too embarrassed to play along, because... <i>there's people watching</i>. So, it's interesting for me... someone with "normal social boundaries", to watch as someone without "normal social boundaries" just freely loves to do something that we both love to do*, while I shy away from it and balk.<br/><br/>*I mean, roleplaying. I don't love to larp Star Trek, especially since it's a pretty Mary Sue game in which he is always Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and I am always Riker and/or Data. But still, that's time where I'm being paid, and I'd gladly be support cast in a sim-heavy Star Trek larp for money.<br/><br/>So that's weird experience <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> - roleplaying with someone who has different social boundaries than I do, and feeling weird about letting down my social guard.<br/><br/>The other weird part is that this guy has some pretty violent tendencies. And saying the wrong thing can escalate a situation pretty abruptly, possibly leading to assault. This isn't specific to the Star Trek game, but the dynamic is different. By default, I don't get a lot of character agency while we play Star Trek. And I get fed appropriate lines quite a lot. And so I have to push for the right to independently play my character, and introduce plot elements, and introduce solutions to the crises that arise. And sometimes that push/pull has led to me getting punched, or death threats, or the like. So this is the first time where I've roleplayed with someone and felt like playing my character wrong could result in physical violence. Which is a bit of a head trip. Which might lead one to think... maybe you should just repeat the lines he feeds you? Maybe. But after fifteen minutes of repeating scripted lines, you really want the autonomy to play your own character. And, as a story games person, I find it hard not to push "trad players" (lol) towards the whole shared story agency thing. And, actually, in all of my communication with this guy I'm not supposed to let him boss me around, but instead work towards cooperating and both being responsible for our own actions. So, in every way, advocating for my own rights in the story fits with how I'm "supposed" to interact with this man.

You can reflect on your own society and place in the world, and maybe it's different for your place).<br/><br/>Mental illness is seen as a concrete and fixed thing with definite boundaries, much like a bicycle or a newspaper or a wart.<br/>And there's an assumption that mental illnesses can be yanked out of a person (like they were that bug-thing in Neo's belly in The Matrix), and that the person can be fixed.<br/>And that instead of being PERSON+illness, they'll just be PERSON. That you can remove something from someone and get a whole person at the end of the process.<br/><br/>The same is true of how people view learning disabilities.<br/>I've heard a lot of people say "Oh, dyslexia? Yeah, I <b>used</b> to <i>have that</i>." Like it was a pog collection, or a sega genesis. A trifling possession from their youth.<br/>I worked for a year in a school for children with dyslexia, and it was absurd how many parents (all of whom had spent considerable time learning about dyslexia, in the process of trying to care for their children, and all of whom were paying $20,000 a year to send their children to this school) were operating on the assumption that I would fix their child, remove the dyslexia, and then they'd be normal.<br/><br/>And so...<br/>when we see a depressed person laughing, we're like "Oh, the operation to remove the illness from PERSON+illness must be complete. Now this person is fixed."<br/>For various definitions of "we", all of which I want to exclude myself from.<br/><br/>I don't know. That got pedantic and I didn't mean it to.<br/>But that's my experience, and having spent some time talking to well-meaning parents about the future of their "different" child's education, it's an experience that's been repeatedly confirmed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251319/#Comment_251319" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T19:11:59+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  7:11PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/>You make some really good points about people's assumptions and misconceptions. One of my regular players is bipolar, and has some other stuff going on as well, and there are times when I get to practice being gentle and non-judging, which needs to happen because she a) is feeling terrible about something going on in her life at present and b) she feels really guilty for canceling a session right before it happens, and wants to please the group.<br/><br/>Jackson, you put it really well when you said you play RPGs (in part) to connect with your friends. I do that too - it's an interesting activity we can do together without spending much money or having to drive somewhere (once we get together, of course). But since it's a thing that I would greatly prefer to do with certain people, specifically to see them interact with a new game, or new kind of game, or something, and thus share that experience together. <br/><br/>Thus, when my friend's bipolar disorder is getting more intense than usual, it's easy to just remind her that we were getting together first and foremost to see one another (even if I am genuinely disappointed about the game, 'cause, man, priorities). <br/><br/>I've actually played with a few people who suffer from severe anxiety disorders, which has helped me learn a lot about how to teach games in ways that are non-cryptic, to be more open-minded about what is "okay" for gameplay, and so on.

People in this condition generally have a very low survival rate -- where depression can be self-preserving (lacking the motivation even to kill oneself), the dysphoric manic is equipped to do whatever it takes.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are three interesting states for my wife that bear on gaming.<br/><br/>While depressed she is incapable of participating. She is interested and may even feel bad about not participating, but she simply cannot get past the effort necessary to engage with other people or even, sometimes, enter the room.<br/><br/>While manic, she is a danger to the table. She's interested, sometimes very aggressively, but cannot be allowed to participate. Everything that happens is incredibly important to her the least issue with rules or inter-player conflict will result in an explosion, possibly including violence, and followed by a long and potentially lethal bout of vicious self-loathing. So when she is feeling anything like manic, she avoids people to save everyone the scene.<br/><br/>While medicated she is uninterested in gaming. It's not that she's too whacked out on the drugs -- it's that she's as close to "healthy" as she ever gets and in this state she has no interest in gaming. She writes, paints, knits, or chats with us from the sidelines. She cooks, laughs, and plays with the pets.

When I started gaming the escapism that it provided was very important and helped me endure the hopelessness and crushing worthlessness that I felt within the rest of my life.  While I was relatively stable it let me pretend that I was the kind of person I wished I could be and then when a major depressive episode struck I would completely drop off the face of the earth, leaving my gaming group in the lurch.  Sometimes I would return to the game in a couple months and sometimes I simply stopped playing with them because I was too embarrased to go back.<br/><br/>My social anxiety made it difficult for me to engage when new people joined the group or I joined an established group.  In live games I tended to interact primarily with people who I already knew from outside the game and was at least moderately comfortable with.<br/><br/>The social circle I primarily gamed within has a large variety of mental illness present within it, though mostly in fairly minor to moderate form.  We have people with OCD, Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, Aspergers, Anxiety, Depression and probably others that I can't think of at the moment.  Largely this manifests in a need for everyone to be understanding and aware of any individuals particular needs and circumstances.  Occasionally it will provoke Social Contract issues, but the prevalence of mild mental illness has led to everyone being much more aware and understanding of issues relating to mental health so that rarely does it become personal.<br/><br/>In the past games featured very little mental illness largely because we dealt with it enough in our real life and gaming was an escape from that, but also because it is hard to portray realistically in a way that doesn't make the game unheroic.  As many of us have, through medication and therapy, treated our mental illness so that is no longer a major daily impediment and moved to games that are less about escapism and more about people, morality, and relationships themes involving mental illness have begun to crop up more frequently.  We are cautious around the subject like we would around any other hot button issue for a player but have adopted the 'I will not abandon you' approach and, thus far, it has been very positive in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251609/#Comment_251609" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T11:14:17+00:00" title="January 20, 2010 11:14AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan, awesome story.

She prefers that the fact of her illness be front and center as if someone can't cope with it or possible fallout from it, then it's better not to surprise them with it. It's proved to be robust, though we lose some friends early rather than late. We lose some late, too, but so far I've been impressed with how much people are willing to risk or compromise to make her welcome even when things have gone bad in recent memory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251693/#Comment_251693" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T00:11:05+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 12:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm a noob here, but I thought that I would comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don not have a mental illness.

Not that this really has ever affected my gaming directly, but there it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good definition of mental illness is "a pattern of feelings, thoughts, or behaviors that are maladaptive or cause disfunction or disability." I am in medical school, I have studied this stuff professionally, and I have struggled with it for most of my life. I am really considering going into psychiatry, but even after all of my training and exposure, I am having a hard time with my ego. I am not sure that I could give up being a "real" doctor. Even lots of training doesn't take away the bias.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main interest in mental illness is the crossover between religion/philosophy/fiction/mental illness. There really is a lot of overlap, and the real differences lie in how many other people hold the same views as you do. For some, it's religion. For some, it's mental illness. For some, it's just a story that they tell. The difference is how much you believe it, and how many others believe the same thing. Shared Imagined Space.

I don't think it matters in the game but can play hell with continuity of a game group. Personally after 25 years as a psychotherapist I find that most people have some symptoms - that's normal. It's how you cope that matters. I've dealt with addiction, depression, OCD and generalized anxiety and come out of a family there it can be a lot worse than that. I've found game making and selling to be remarkably theraputic. Games are a medium to conect to people with.

The foundation of health is behavior. Ignoring mental health is building an expesnive and elaborate castle on a foundation of shifting sand. What the heart surgoen does can be undone in moments in a patient with mental heath problems. I know all that. It is a matter of letting go of my ego, ignoring the fact that I know people will think "He could have been so much more." I am interested in other things. I like lots of areas of medicine. I just can't get away from the fact that in the US, there is likely no more important discipline than psychiatry. We have mostly beaten infectious causes of disease, we have a long way to go with genetic disease, and almost all of the biological aspects of disease in the US are created by behavior, and a good part of the most serious health problems are mental health problems (think substance abuse including tobacco).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about the partial threadjack.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often wondered about mental health of characters in RPGs. Not just the sanity rules in CoC. In a world with actual illusions, alternate realities, curses, and real magic, how can we meaningfully engage with schizophrenia? Depression would be "unheroic" to portray accurately, and I am not sure what kind of mechanics would create fun motivation to play unfun demotivation. Substance abuse comes up in many games, but in such an unrealistic way that it doesn't allow really meaningful engagement. Mechanics could definitely be produced to reflect substance abuse, but making them fun might be hard. Many PCs have personality disorders. They are definitely fun to play, and it may be that really engaging games could be created with personality disorder mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will have to really think about psychotic disorders and personality disorders in RPGs. Role playing is part of many therapies, so it might be interesting to address mental health therapies from the perspective of game designer. There could be some really amazing stuff that could come out in both the games and the therapy arenas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251935/#Comment_251935" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T18:21:50+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  6:21PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick search lead to this.

I went through a lot of counseling and actually improved but its lead me to confront a lot of things. One Im in a community that deals poorly with any mental illness, the Military, and have had arguments at some mandatory training sessions with other members because they either think depression is a joke, or can be easily overcome by just being happy (the military has a lot of dumb stigmas about being depressed and those need to go away). Two my mother was certainly Bipolar and very abusive and willing to take out her depressive state on anyone around her, but especially loved ones. Three I've probably been suffering from depression for a long time, but finally got to the point that I was unable to function at all during my break. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I turned to gaming as an escape from my depression and my mothers Bipolar disorder because it let me be the hero and be in control. I was fortunate to seek out really talanted gamers to relate too many just as wounded as me. Only one of them really really turned me off to gaming and left me cold at the table. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in Washington State in the early 90's I was playing a Synnibar game of all things with my regular GM and some of his friends from Olympia. One of them was a very scary sadistic kind of person who openly embraced satanism and (he was GMing at this game and insisted that all our characters become satanic evil and murder people). The scary part was that he was actually 100 percent serious. I walked away from that game pretty quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me I wouldn't say my depression is cured,... merely on hold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251962/#Comment_251962" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T22:27:14+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 10:27PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with mood disorders is that they override your personality.

But through it all I kept getting kicked up again by my roleplaying contacts, kicked out of my dark room and into contact with other people. I have spent many years learning to cope with my brain being an untrustworthy bastard and I still have to keep a close eye on my behaviour. <br/>\n<br/>\nThrough it all, roleplaying has given me a safe place to practice my social interactions in a safe environment, both in the game and around the table. When I started on my treatments of cognitive therapy it all came naturally to me, because roleplaying had given me the exact same tools used to combat irrational thoughts and the personal experience that you can change yourself into something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough roleplaying we experience a lot more diverse social interaction than mainstream experiences have to offer, I think this leads to an easier acceptance of people acting slightly odd, as those of us with mental issues are wont to do. Also, I have yet to meet a roleplayer that have not personally experienced mental illness in themselves or the immediate family, we are all slightly broken people in the same tribe. That being said, it is all about knowing how your issues affect others and knowing how to handle it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251990/#Comment_251990" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-22T05:20:04+00:00" title="January 22, 2010  5:20AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few years ago, I was in a game run by a friend of mine who tended towards depression, and whose parents had just divorced. He was a very idealistic dude (shy, never had a girlfriend) and had assumed his parents would be together forever. The PCs consisted of just me and his best friend. It was an unmitigated disaster. A confusing plot, serious amounts of railroading, you name it. He'd have characters that shouldn't be able to do so (weak small gods in Exalted, vs. Solars) subdue the characters, take their weapons, and force them to do the god's bidding. I'm not usually a huge stickler for canonical fidelity or rules lawyering, but everything was so egregious that I was fairly relieved the game never got momentum back after being postponed two weeks.<br/><br/>I was fighting with him about something a year later, and for some reason I don't remember, he brought up the game. "Jesus Elizabeth! My parents had just split up, I'm stuck in a shit job, and I'm alone. Did it ever occur to you that I might want to control <i>one fucking thing</i> in my life?"<br/><br/>That was kind of, uh, uncomfortable. Our friendship pretty much dissipated after that (not just because of the fight, for a lot of reasons) and I'm still kind of spooked by the notion that I should let someone control my actions (even in something as trivial as a game) just to make them feel better about themselves.

He liked to have our characters get insta-killed for no apparent reason (sometimes very good reasons, but he would only tell some players and not others...), he had clear favorites (I was his very clear un-favorite, and I went through more characters than anybody), and just generally acted like a dick. I mean, to be fair, we were in 8th grade, but no one else was being this harsh.

Yes, we were gaming at the time as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've always thought about how the two of us game differently, but it's not something I can put completely into words just at the moment.  What I can say is that he knows he is a different person when he is medicated.  He will tell you what parts of him are shut off by certain drugs, and he's grown not to like it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing he's not good at in general is social interaction.  No surprise to me, he games like a rules lawyer.  When he runs games, he remembers every modifier and power that can be used in a situation.  He tests his knowledge by participating in optimization forum discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twist is, he doesn't use all this knowledge all the time.  He keeps it there as a defense.  He uses gaming to tell stories and put people in interesting situations, and when they are dicks about it (to him, that means murdering a harmless but plot important NPC) he brings down the wrath of the game system upon them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe in a way, games like D&amp;D are social interaction "on his terms"?<br/>\n<br/>\n@ an earlier comment: The practice of treating a mental-illness as a "Hindrance" or "Disadvantage" that can be bought off later is yes, despicable.

I bet that it would have been fine if he'd expressed something first, rather than blew up.  Like, he had started the game with "You know, I have a pretty linear game here, and I'm going through a lot right now.  Can you guys go along with my NPCs and stuff?" That would have been OK, right?<br/><br/>In my job I have a very frustrating coworker; someone whose issues make him extremely absolutist, defensive and hostile.  This attitude means other people have to walk on eggshells around him, but he doesn't have any corresponding obligation of sensitivity to others' needs, and discussion along those lines makes him explode.  <br/><br/>I'm convinced he's suffering from depression or some other disorder, because I used to have tendencies like that (especially when I was a teenager).  The difference is that this guy is taking stuff out on his coworkers, while I'm suffering similarly but still looking out for other people. <br/><br/>If I dealt with my depression with hostility and anger, I'd be a menace too.

Four years ago I lost my job because of depression, and a lot happens in four years.  I supported my wife through her illness and a very bad period of unemployment, I've had a daughter and have another on the way, I've gotten a much better job, and had a lot of success at work. So I just had to get better at dealing with these situations. <br><br>But it's not all rosy; I've now been off work for 2 weeks, on-and-off suicidal for 2 months, and while I've got excellent short-term disability benefits this will probably hurt my career and reputation in the long run. My old medication never really did what it was supposed to, and switching from one drug to another to another has been absolute torture. <br><br>The worst of this corresponded with the December gaming break (because holidays are the worst), but besides doing character creation for a Sorcerer game I haven't had the energy to really work on my own projects. Still, I'm hopeful that this time the drugs, the counseling, and the time off will get me back on my feet so I can go back to work and really enjoy my Dreamation vacation.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252409/#Comment_252409" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-24T19:05:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2010  7:05PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A general note to head off concerned whispers: I dropped the S-word but I don't wany to make a huge deal about it.

I'm mostly well-controlled with medication and CBT techniques, but there's a strong seasonal component and some interaction with other health issues that means I have a maddening tendency to start games, have a great time, and then just hit that place where I need to give the little energy and attention I have to other things.<br/><br/>It would do me a world of good to have a more stable group of people to play with so I could more easily "step back" when things are low, but as it stands I end up in the GM/organizer/teacher/recruiter/everything-else-r role more often than not.

The title made me think it would be about roleplaying mental illness.  Gaming with someone with mental illness is not something I had ever considered.  At worst, we have a few gamers who we know are not always up to hang out with people.  When that happens, we plan accordingly.  I would have to say that we've never had to deal with this issue at the gaming table.  I guess a few ADHD types have gamed with us, but it must've been mild, and making the game get into their heads seemed to keep their attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256899/#Comment_256899" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T20:45:35+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  8:45PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, if anybody interested in this to chill and say hi at Dreamation, whisper me and I'll give you my phone# so you can text me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334859/#Comment_334859" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T21:14:53+00:00" title="July 16, 2011  9:14PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thread.

It has had a significant impact on my gaming experiences, and often lack of them, over the years, and wrecked large sections of my life since my early teens. It isn't fun. Explained simply, I will exhibit irrational compulsive behavior in certain social situations if certain triggers occur. It could be particular a word being spoken. It could be people looking at me too closely. Mostly I will want to conceal the huge panic and embarassment that hits me, and get away. One of my key triggers is sitting on a chair at a table with a bunch of people. This isn't about shyness. I'm very social, and I like showing off and getting attention. It's about a psycholocical dysfuction that kicks in out of nowhere and fucks stuff up for me. <br/><br/>I prefer to game standing up, if I can walk and move I'm much more likely to keep the panic under control. I'm a bit like that cowboy Paul Newman played... I shoot better when I move.<br/><br/>I've learned to manage it over the years, but it has never stopped. The best technique I have for dealing with it is to tell people in advance, and to tell them immediately if the panic gets out of control. I guess that's what I'm doing now...telling people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334883/#Comment_334883" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T04:58:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  4:58AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game I'm doing for the Game Chef 2011 challenge is a variation on a psychotherapy game.

I've always been shy and a lot of my depression, especially in HS, was anxiety about what my peers and friends thought of me, which really hindered my ability to reach out to people.  I don't game very much because of this, even now.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets nervous walking into a room of strangers, but I've been telling myself for years that one day I'll go to a local gaming group (board games or anything) and finally meet people I can game with regularly.  For some reason, I can do it just fine when I'm in a strange town (hello San Francisco and Chicago and Seattle and Portland), but I can't do it in my home town.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341029/#Comment_341029" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T01:30:12+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  1:30AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2011 4:17AM by Bad_Santa.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have suffered from major depression on and off for the majority of my life.  I can remember having my first suicidal episode around the age of 9 and it's been haunting me for 22 years now.  I wasn't diagnosed until just over 4 years ago, I attempted suicide a year before that and completely concealed that fact for 14 months. I've gotten so good at concealing and so convinced that I can't let anyone help me that treatment has been very difficult.  Luckily the diagnosis coincided with my exiting the military honorably, so I've had access to more care than I can stand, but everything that I need and it has saved my life, even though I'm still dealing with the worst of it sometimes.  I've had difficulty staying employed and with relationships all my life.<br/><br/>My greatest symptom supressor is being around people.  I both genuinely feel better and conceal what I don't feel good about, so gaming is something I'm drawn too.  My character choices tend to be fatalistic in some way.  Even when they aren't, if an opportunity presents itself to sacrifice themselves I often jump at it.  It took me a while to realize I was acting out a suicide fantasy.<br/><br/>I've participated in group therapy with people dealing with a wide range of disorders.  It's been informative and helpful for me, both in real lie and in gaming.  Understanding not just why people with a certain disorder think the way they do, but what the thoughts sound like at the time really help me empathize and recreate similarities in characters when needed.<br/><br/>It's nice seeing a thread about this and having people share their experiences.  Cultural attitudes are slowly changing concerning mental health, but the more it's talked about the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341034/#Comment_341034" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T05:49:02+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  5:49AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder how much emotional illness leads to the desire to play dark edgy games?<br/><br/>On the one hand I live with emotional gunk every day (in my own head and in my day job) so I don't seek out "gripping emotional content" in games - I get that at work. I imagine wanting to play light fun games with rosey outlooks rather than mean dark futures.<br/><br/>I remember hearing a pod cast of Vincent Baker saying that he worked in IT and thus did not have a lot of human contact (beyond the standard IT talk I guess) and that he really needed gripping games to live. His wife works in some social service field on the other hand and was like me, getting enough of that on the job. <br/><br/>I guess I'm just personally leery of diving into the void.

Some people manage their symptoms, others are managed by them.  Some seek to escape, others to contrast in sharp relief.<br/><br/>At least for me it's not that I seek out certain gaming experiences that relate to my illness, but rather just recognizing how my illness has impacted my gaming.  Understanding why I'm making the choices that I've made helps me to understand my illness better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341077/#Comment_341077" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T11:38:11+00:00" title="August 31, 2011 11:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if there's potential for the (relatively) safe space of RPG play to provide opportunities for positive practice or reinforcement in dealing with negative mental states.

I find psychodrama and role-playing have a lot of overlap (there's role-taking, and the emerging narrative is a core element of both).  I could totally see RPGs used as a therapeutic tool, but there are a few really, really important things that are missing - safety, a clear contract, and expertise.<br/><br/>Things like confidentiality, the group's understanding that if William gets triggered (because this role-playing situation is very close to his real life, something you'd be aiming for at least tangentially if it's supposed to help William), the group's not going to abandon him (however subtly, such as by changing the subject) and the facilitator is going to have the practice to normalize what's happening (so it just doesn't become That Session We Don't Talk About), or help the group out if somebody's issue starts to manifest as conflict in the group itself.<br/><br/>A clear contract is also key - providing someone with an environment where they can work through a deeply seated mental habit (e.g. giving up on themselves just as they're about to succeed) can't be done unless the group knows what it's aiming for, and this itself takes patience to uncover.  Otherwise you get four people analyzing William with pop psychology and trying to 'fix' what they perceive the problem to be.<br/><br/>There are other agendas at work in a role-playing game (e.g. making things overly dramatic, when often the opposite is helpful) that could be working at cross purposes. Someone could go home having had the opposite experience from the one that would have been most helpful to them.<br/><br/>As an example, consider a role-playing game that evoked themes of of sexual abuse and its connection with suicidal behavior, being played by a group of people with histories of sexual abuse. Not to be undertaken lightly!  (And yet, with the right supports in place, this is what psychodrama does and it's fucking magical.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341098/#Comment_341098" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T14:05:10+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  2:05PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><br/>I know this thread is rather old, but still -- I just want to applaud you for saying so, man.

Games and stories in themselves are great tools without needing therapy level support. Research has shown that optimism and healthy goal oriented habits can be bolstered by playing games, and the catharsis and joy of an emotionally engaging story is also well known. The great thing about RPGs is they can hit both of these things together.  This is the way games worked for me. Both as escapism and working through depression and anxiety. In fact, if it wasn't for games, I'd probably never gotten past some crippling social shyness.<br/><br/>To take the idea a bit deeper, drama therapy and arts therapy are amazing resources at taking emotions, feelings, habits, etc and placing them outside your head to get a better look at what's going on. Many of the same tools in the practice of drama therapy are the same ones from improv, and could readily apply to roleplay. But that sort of play is really heavy stuff and guided by a licensed therapist. Many people don't want to deal with it (even when they're paying someone to help them deal with it). Also, without someone in the room who is a trained therapist, you're more likely to end up causing more problems. You'd need to have some firm boundaries and limits (established by the rules of a hypothetical game). Though, a game system designed for mental care is something I'm really interested in, and I think the possibility might be out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341115/#Comment_341115" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T15:50:29+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  3:50PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2011 6:18PM by Ry.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Ry, you've mentioned some positive spillover from gaming to real life.

The former has worked great for me, the latter is ass hattery.  <br/><br/>It's kind of like this fictional example: Say I play too many video games, to the point where it's a problem for my relationships with the people I care about.  Then I find out I have ADHD.  Now, I can use that knowledge to help me figure out why I'm struggling, or I can use it as an excuse to keep playing.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have a recent example of getting therapeutic value from play, but it's also a rambly "let me tell you about my character" story and a "let me tell you about my issues" story, so I'm a little hesitant.  If I get a few whispers asking for it I'll go for it, though.  <br/><br/><br/><b><a href="/forums/profile/RyanMacklin">@RyanMacklin</a></b>: Thanks man, I appreciate you joining in.

They overreact or underreact (and run away). Most people just don't know how to respond and be present. <br/><br/>After my Dad committed suicide (almost thirty years ago now) I remember people just not talking to me. I didn't want to talk so that worked out but had I wanted to there was no one there. I know that that experience was what lead me to become a psychotherapist. <br/><br/>I think about suicidal thoughts now as an experience of pain. If my hand is in a fire, pain tells me to pull it out. It still hurts after I pull out but it is a healthy move. If I have a suicidal thought it is pain that says "Something isn't right in my life - Can I change something?" So if I respond to it I'm being healthy. Kind of the definition of not an illness.<br/><br/>What I'm bugged by is how people overreact to cutting. They assume it is a suicidal move when it's usually just a way to distract one's self from another kind of pain. New therapists always seem to fall into that. That and avoiding or diving into crying.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11316/gaming-and-mental-illness" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11316/gaming-and-mental-illness" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11316/gaming-and-mental-illness/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11316%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11316%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
