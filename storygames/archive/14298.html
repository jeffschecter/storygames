I don't have the time or energy to read every single thread here, not even the first post. Like you, I gravitate towards the topics that interest me, and avoid the ones that don't. Means that I miss out on some cool threads until people hit me up later, but that's the way things go.<br/><br/>So keep this in the back of your head: There's this Thread Topic called "The Best of Story Games". If you see threads that just knocked your socks off, filled you with ideas, somehow changed the way you play,or so good that you Bookmarked it, then let me know!<br/><br/>Either whisper me from inside the thread, or email me (click on my handle name to see my email addy) and tell me the link. <br/><br/>I'm pretty liberal about what gets added to that Sacred Category, so if it indeed looks cool I'll add it to the Best-Of topic, to represent those threads that We (or I, but less so than the We) think exemplify the forum. <br/><br/>So again, see anything cool here lately that really hit your brain? Whisper or email me for consideration for the "Best Of" category.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324883/#Comment_324883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T05:28:52+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  5:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe we could add a button/link to posts that could report the post number to admins (possibly with explanatory text)?

Realizing that a lot of cool stuff was being broken down, but not being able to digest it all at once (beyond concerns of my own experiences/reactions being different to others who might have been more impacted). So I definitely want more folks to chime in with the stuff they've found excellent lately.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Richie" title="Richie"><img alt="Richie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Richie">Richie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330345/#Comment_330345" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T20:31:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  8:31PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 8:33PM by Richie.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really really helpful advice for <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14486&amp;page=1#Item_52" rel="nofollow">MCing AW</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
