                    I've been searching for a way to build tension with the card-based mechanic I'm using for 'The Naked City: a game of Film Noir'.  Let me explain the mechanic and how I am <b>trying</b> to build tension so I can get some feedback from you all.<br/><br/>Each player gets a hand of playing cards to use during conflicts.  There are various ways to get more cards when needed or to exchange unwanted cards for new ones.<br/><br/>The cards range in value from 2-Ace, and the different suits mean different things for narration purposes and for upping the stakes.<br/>-Diamonds (conversation) leads to Clubs (material) leads to Hearts (emotional) leads to Spades (power/domination)<br/><br/>When a conflict begins the "protagonist" in the scene lays down a card from their hand.  The "antagonist" can either:<br/>1. Cede the conflict to the other player.<br/>2. Play a higher card of the same suit (Raising).<br/>3. Play a higher card of a higher suit (Trumping).<br/><br/>Play continues back and forth until one player cedes the conflict either because they don't have the cards to continue or because the "price" is too high to continue.<br/><br/>The winner of the conflict gets to narrate an outcome, which assumes a certain level of concession to the loser depending on how far the winning card was from the card played before it.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>Darla Burgess (played by Chris), a snide lounge singer who has confronted her ex-lover Martin Aimes (played by Tony), a corrupt bookmaker who in his office at the time.  Darla's intent is to get him to admit that he is sleeping with one of Darla's friends named Amanda.  Martin is trying to keep the relationship a secret for other reasons.<br/><br/>Chris wants to start things off simple and leads with a 6 of diamonds (talking).  The suit defines the types of narration and the card value defines how far up the temperature scale things are.
<blockquote>"Martin, why did you leave the club with her last night?  There were plenty of other guys who could have given her a ride."</blockquote>
Tony wants to keep Darla talking and responds with a raise to 8 of diamonds.
<blockquote>His body language is still a bit defensive as he lights a cigarette.  "Listen, she is having a really tough time with her father in the hospital and needed someone to talk to."</blockquote>
Chris doesn't have a higher diamond card to respond with, doesn't want to cede and conflict and chooses not to spend currency to get another card.  He has Darla trump and raise the stakes with a 9 of clubs (material).
<blockquote>"I saw you flashing the cash around her last night.  Trying to play the "big man", huh?  She won't tell anyone where she got that rock on her finger from.  Just admit what's been going on!"  She is starting to seethe at this point.</blockquote>
Tony needs to hide the relationship and he doesn't have any club cards, so he takes a chance and trumps with a Jack of hearts (emotional).
<blockquote>Martin walks over to Darla and cradles her face in his hand.  "Darla, you still mean a lot to me.  You know I wouldn't hurt you like that."</blockquote>
Chris has already used two cards in this conflict and doesn't want it to spill over at this point.  So he decides to cede the conflict knowing that the difference between his last 9 of clubs and Tony's last Jack of hearts means that Jack will need to concede quite a bit during his narration and that Martin can't just run rampant over Darla.<br/><br/>So that is the simple version of the conflict mechanic minus using traits, trust and the Past/Present timing of the scene.<br/><br/>And I've been trying to figure out how to build in a mechanic for the increasing guilt and desperation of Noir characters.  Characters in the game accumulate Guilt Points and when they reach seven points, the character has their Downfall, which could be going insane and being committed or driving through the police barracades into certain death.  The narration would get more desperate of course.  But I wanted there to be a real effect on gameplay as these Guilt Points were accumulated.  So last night I came up with a first pass of ideas for how a player would be constrained during conflicts based on how many Guilt Points they have.  <br/><br/>Guilt Level:             Effects (cumulative):<br/>0:                            No effect<br/>1:                            Cannot lead a conflict with a 2-4<br/>2:                            Must raise at least by 3 points or else trump<br/>3:                            Cannot lead with a diamond<br/>4:                            Must raise at least by 5 points or else trump<br/>5:                            Cannot lead with a diamond<br/>6:                            Must always trump is possible<br/>7:                            DOWNFALL<br/><br/>A bit extreme, but that's my first pass.<br/><br/><b>I'm looking for feedback on the mechanic and tension-building with trumps and increase in Guilt Points.</b><br/><br/>Any thoughts?<br/>Chris                </div>

                            Caesar, first I'm going to not answer the question you actually posed and ask what happens to the played cards at the end of the conflict.  Please tell me the losing side picks them up! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>More to the point, I think you're on the right tack, at least, although I might give folks a 'safety zone' of 0-2 guilt with no effect, and then lay in with the effects.  How crippling are these, do you think?  The biggest problem this <em>could</em> lead to is that it disincentivizes players from entering any conflicts at all.  If you're too bound up to be effective, you won't try.<br/><br/>On the other hand, allowing guys with high guilt to discard cards they can't play and replace them with others may be a good tactic, here.  Then they can still play their whole hand is just filled with badness, and they'll be itching to use it all.                        </div>

                            Joshua, currently the cards are being discarded to a pile so everyone can see that cards have already been used.  But I will give some deep thought to giving the cards to the losing side.  I think it has some real merit!<br/><br/>I think you are probably right that someone should be able to accumulate a <b>little</b> guilt before it starts to hurt.<br/><br/>Currently I am allowing a player to discard any two cards from their hand to draw one new one.  So if you have 3-4 Guilt Points and are pretty much done talking, you might want to discard a few diamonds in hopes of getting something better.                        </div>

So do you want Guilt to be a <em>penalty</em> (cause if I have to reduce my hand if I get Guilt, I'm being penalized), or do you want it to be a consequence that guides later contributions to the fiction?<br/><br/>Or put it another way: do you <em>want</em> most or all characters to accumulate Guilt in any given game?  If your answer is 'yes' then don't penalize players for doing what they're supposed to be doing.                        </div>

My intent is the latter.  I want the accumulation of Guilt to be a mechanic that feels inevitable to some extent (like accumulating Pain in Contenders or Self-Loathing in MLWM).  It should cause a short-term increase in power or influence (since you stop caring to an extent), but will eventually lead to a character's Downfall.<br/><br/>So based on my own intent, it sounds like I am going down the wrong path by attaching conflict penalties to the Guilt Points.  Hmm...                        </div>

                            Don't think of them as conflict penalties; think of them as constraining conflict.  Just make sure that player options within that constraint are not also crippled.  So for instance, if I can no longer play "just talking" diamond cards, let me discard and replace them for free, filling my hand with higher-escalation cards.  I'm still effective; in fact, I'm getting rid of the least-powerful cards.  It's just that my narration is now guided towards more excessive action.  See what I mean?                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm getting it.  So based on your example, if I played a 5 of diamonds and your Guilt Points meant that you had to trump me, you could dump any diamonds in your hands and potentially get a nice killer card?<br/><br/>My gut is that the right answer is somewhere in-between, but I am digging your feedback because it is really making me drill down on mechanics.                        </div>

                            I don't see any insentive not to lead with a high card. For example, if you have a 6 and a 10 (same suit), why would you ever play the 6? It seems to me if you initiated a conflict that you wanted to win, you would play the highest card you had in the suit you wanted. If you wanted to win by talking and played an Ace of Diamonds, your opponent would be hard pressed to respond.<br/><br/>Granted, I don't know anything about how traits and card management play into things, but that seems problematic.<br/><br/>I've been playing around a lot with card mechanics and the thing works best for me is if both participants play cards face down at the same time. Then it becomes a bluffing game: you want to win (or lose), but you want your opponent to always believe you are playing a good card so he will spend a higher card value.<br/><br/>I do like your "guilt leads to faster escalation".                        </div>

                            I think I might side with Joshua on the "playing the 6 rather than the 10" but I totally see your point.<br/><br/>More problematic for me is the "I play the Ace of Diamonds and pretty much win" tactic.  But you'd better want to win that conflict pretty bad to use up an Ace since there are only four in the deck.<br/><br/>I think your bluffing game would work well in a lot of other situations.  It certainly creates some nice tension at the table when they get flipped over!  But it happens in this game that I'm literally looking for players to put their character's "cards" on the table and use them to drive the narrative forward.<br/><br/>Damn, you guys are making me think:)                        </div>

                            Yes, like Patrick, I'm not sure that the mechanics really facilitate the slow tension build you want.<br/><br/>As a thought experiment: imagine if you had to play the lowest card in your hand, except that one point of Guilt meant you could play the second lowest instead; two points meant you could also play the third lowest; etc etc. (Lowest meaning lowest in rank and suit, of course, although it's also interesting if it means lowest in any suit). That way, you'd have to do the slow build.<br/><br/>Or, say, imagine that you total all the cards played to get the winner of the conflict. Something like that.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I need to stay away from all boards like this.  *Every* time I start to develop a game I come across a post with almost the exact same mechanics I've been fiddling with for months.  Same genre even this time.  (Though I was looking at Ed Brubaker's Sleeper as my primary inspiration).<br/><br/>I guess there are only so many ways you can use dice or playing cards to facilitate narrative-style rpgs, but still... deflating.<br/><br/>Keep hashing this out, Chris - it sounds awesome.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Matthew, there have been several times in this game alone where I've "come up" with an idea or a concept only to find someone else has mined that ore already or is at least thinking about it.  I totally would not be deflated about it.  Noir is a popular trope and there are many games out their that use Noir either as a setting or as inspiration.  I just finally put the blinders on and said that I'm going to make the game that I'm going to make.  I'm not worried about originality as much as fun.  If there weren't already games like PTA and Contenders then I probably wouldn't have been looking at cards in the first place.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the nice words.  It really does help!                        </div>

                            Sure thing.  Yeah, I hear what you're saying about inspirations and originality deflation.  Dust Devils and a boardgame called Taj Mahal were some of my mechanical inspirations.<br/><br/>I've a drafting phase mechanic called Foreshadowing and have special archetype mechanics associated with the Aces (doomed hero), Kings (authority), Queens (femme fatale), and Jacks (any other character).  You feel clever when you're fiddling around with the stuff, but once you've chosen a genre with such strong memes (Noir) and a resolution medium (playing cards), there's bound to be all kinds of obvious choices such that most of any number of designers working independently would have similar things popping up.<br/><br/>Something I keep coming across (maybe you can relate) is that what is perhaps my favorite genre is at odds with my design and play preferences.  At least on the intuitive surface.  I generally want players to succeed, but it ain't often in the cards.  I want my mechanics to match that desparate feel of Noir, but that's generally a less fun mode for me personally.<br/><br/>My actual resolution sounds different from yours, so I'm not looking for a "why not play the Ace?' solution, but if the Ace is the Doomed Hero, well, that might lead you to some interesting ideas...                        </div>

                            It's hard to bluff if you know what is on the table. When the first player plays his card, things are uncertain, but after that each player is reacting to a known thing (the last card his opponent played). What if you set things up so that both players put down cards at the same time?<br/><br/>Here a 30-second idea. Make it so that you need a certain number of victories or a given card total to win a conflict. Each time both players play cards. High suit wins, followed by high rank. However, if you win by suit instead of by rank, you pay a penalty (e.g. gain Guilt). Also, once a given suit is played, you can no longer play cards from a lower suit.<br/><br/>This gives you an insentive to play good cards of a low suit early, since you won't be able to play them later. But you may also want to escalate to a higher suit, depending on you cards. If you escalate too soon, you may be left with not enough cards of the higher suit, but if you escalate early you can squeeze out some victories with low cards, but at a cost.<br/><br/>It's not really a full mechanic, but something based on simultaneous card play adds a lot of uncertainty and an element of bluffing into the game.<br/><br/>Also, I like Graham's suggestion that guilt makes you play low cards. It makes guilt a real penalty and fits the situation: you are guilty about past mistakes and holding back.                        </div>

Well...I actually suggested it the other way round: that Guilt lets you play higher cards. If you've got no guilt, you have to play your lowest card. If you've got one point, you're allowed to play your lowest or second lowest. And so on.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Missing from this conversation is how you get Guilt points in the first place so forgive me if this doesn't match your rules.  Make Guilt points something the character takes instead of receives.  For example, Player One plays a six of diamonds Player Two plays a 9 of clubs.  Now player one has a hand of high diamonds and low everything else.  So she takes a Guilt point and shifts her Jack of Diamonds to a Jack of Clubs.  She must now narrate the action as hurtful to herself and player Two.  Or taking a Guilt point lets you increase the value of the card by five or something like that.  If the cards don't refresh often then eventually you are going to be left with low cards and no other way to win but taking Guilt.                        </div>

Well...I actually suggested it the other way round: that Guilt lets you play higher cards. If you've got no guilt, you have to play your lowest card. If you've got one point, you're allowed to play your lowest or second lowest. And so on.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>I misunderstood, so I reread what Graham said. By itself, being forced to play your lowest card wouldn't work, I think. It means (a) you have no choices to make and (b) makes it disadvantageous to have a large hand, which is strange.<br/><br/>Some kind of happy medium might work, though, such as being prevent from using you highest card or highest two cards or cards of a certain suit if you have a lower suit available. That is pretty much what Caesar_X proposed originally, which validates his original idea.                        </div>
