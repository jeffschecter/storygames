I'm still sleepy.  Still have a too-much-sugar / not-enough-sleep style gaming hangover.<br/><br/>Friday night I just chilled and got into my convention groove.  Walked around the place and chatted with folks.<br/><br/>Saturday morning I got in on some Spirit of the Century.  Which was pretty darned cool.  I only wish I knew that our Fate tokens were also narrative authority tokens a bit earlier in the game.  The whole thing probably would have gotten some more steam earlier if I'd been using them like that the whole time.<br/><br/>Saturday afternoon was nap time.  Holy crap was I tired.<br/><br/>Saturday evening was Call of Cthulhu with a group of solid non-hippie gamers.  There was some reading from prepared text, a few moments of waiting for everyone to get that darned non-plot oriented RPing out of the way, and just a little bit of a split between the players who wanted to play horror-flavor and the players who wanted to play mission-flavor.  But, in the end, the GM pulled through and helped make everything come out awesome in the last few scenes.<br/><br/>Sunday morning through afternoon was the Mountain Witch game that James was in.  It went pretty well.  Most of the players seemed to be really excited about the whole thing.  But I'm pretty sure I could have done better.  After my recent computer crash, I procrastinated on getting fresh bang-y material together.  I was still writing up my cornerstone material on Saturday.  Which is way less prepared than I like to be for conventions.<br/><br/>Also, there was having dinner with Luke and Andy at the Armidillo Grill, followed by the verbal molestation of the Krispy Kreme doughnut glazer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108838/#Comment_108838" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T09:34:36+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  9:34AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck.

I didn't have a character, but participated anyway and moderated a bit.  That seemed to work excellently, which was nice to learn.  We turned the weirdness up to 11 and, surprisingly, the game could totally handle it.  It didn't even buckle, much less break.  In the second to last station (after we'd opened all the others), half the characters converged on it all at once.  We had previously determined that it was jam-packed with faceless policemen.  Somebody, I think, happened to call it a "sea of policemen," which led Elizabeth to declare that she was literally swimming through the sea.  And then I said the subway car was floating on the sea like an arc.  And then Rachel said it was full of singing animals, refugees from two previous stations (one full of music, the other full of animals wearing caps).  And then John said the green ooze (from yet another station) was leaking down the tunnel and causing the policemen it touched to disappear, creating a kind of green landmass amidst the ocean of blue uniforms.  But the weirdness never got in the way of the kind of abstract problem solving that is at the core of the game.  At one point, John basically realized, "Hey, clearly we have to feed the strange little girls with multicolored balloons to the tattooed green slime monster that just emerged out of the wall."  And, he was right.  Based on what had been established in the game, that was what needed to happen.  So, overall, there are a few things that need to be tweaked or explained better, but it was really solid.  I don't think the game necessarily HAS to be that weird all the time, but it's good to know that it CAN be that weird and the game can still handle it just fine.<br/><br/>After lunch, I played Emily's <i>A Day in the War</i>.  I'd link to the Knife Fight thread, but it's already changed a bunch.  Basically you play people involved in the ongoing mess in Iraq, split among various factions, and you play out the events that lead up to their death.  Originally, Emily had a rule about basing your character on a real person who died, in an effort to remember them, but that continues to feel really uncomfortable for many players (I didn't end up picking a person) and Emily said that was likely going to get dropped.  Despite that issue, the game played really great with the mechanic she borrowed from Eero Tuovinen's <i>Zombie Game</i>, which has one character move towards their death for every character that moves towards achieving their goals (though you still die even if you achieve your goals).  it felt like playing <i>Otherkind</i> or <i>Bliss Stage</i>, where you have a limited number of resources and too many baskets to put them in, such that something is always left wanting.  In this game, some character was always left wanting, with their situation growing more grim, no matter how much we wanted to do the right thing and make sure everybody got through this.  The characters were a Shiite businessman with two sons in the US, a military contractor for Blackwater, a US officer in charge of a checkpoint, a CNN journalist looking for a big story, and an aid worker trying to perform vaccinations.  I really had a great time with the other players, who were from Northampton, but I don't remember their names, unfortunately.  A few of us felt a little uncomfortable, I think, enjoying the game so much, when it was directly inspired by a horrible ongoing conflict (that emotional reaction, I suspect, may be what Em's looking for), but I definitely think it helped me work through some feelings I had about the war, especially about military contractors, though I found I wanted to play it more, maybe playing multiple sessions (like 3 or so), with different goals each session that I could win or lose, even if I still died at the end of session 3.  I'd be interested to see if the game could work in that format.  Also, I kept thinking about the Angolan and Chinese civil wars and how the system, which was fairly sparse, could work in any complex, terrible conflict.  Definitely a good educational tool for showing the multiplicity of any given situation.  Can't wait to play it again and watch it develop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109367/#Comment_109367" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T10:15:55+00:00" title="November 23, 2007 10:15AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MACE was my first gaming con and it was sweet.

The other guy playing (Allen?) really got into his character and provided the muscle my character lacked.  Eric did an excellent job as Mr. Hasan and saved our bacon several times with clever ideas.  It took me a while to get going though.  I didn't 'find my character' soon enough and was too reactionary I think.
