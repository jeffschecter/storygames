Cost-based resolution.  Resolution systems where your success rate is determined more by what you're willing to pay for it than by your stats or what-have-you.  I'm not talking about the bid &amp; risk dynamic that you find in, say, D&amp;D combat (if you think about it, the combats boil down to bids and risks of HP, riding on the dice)--I'm talking about where, through the agency of the mechanics, the cost of success is determined and <i>based on that</i> you, the player, choose to succeed or to fail.<br/><br/>My aschan The Rustbelt does this, allowing the players to Push on failed die rolls to get a guaranteed success, for a Price determined by the difference between the target number and the roll and negotiated between GM and player.  The Price is usually some sort of harm, or the introduction of some sort of inconvenience or danger.  It's really good for brutal, desperate action sequences in the manner of <i>Mad Max</i> or <i>The Wild Bunch</i>.<br/><br/>I thought that I invented this.  HA!<br/><br/>It turns out that at more-or-less the same time, Robert Bohl put a cost-based mechanic in his game Misspent Youth.  You can override a loss by selling out.  And the way that selling out manifests in the mechanics is the shiz-nite.<br/><br/>Then I found out about Vincent Baker's The Otherkind.  Yep, there's another one.  Even though there's a possibility that success is totally impossible, you can usually take success at the expense of one or more of the other concerns.<br/><br/>All of these are frickin' awesome.  Does anyone know of any other cost-based resolution systems out there?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154462/#Comment_154462" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T12:52:37+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 12:52PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bliss Stage, which is of Otherkind descent, and basically any fortune in the middle mechanics where you roll before you assign dice to things that you want to accomplish.

You allocate your resources toward the success of some kind of action or actions (it's really a task-based resolution system disguised as Conflict Resolution, wherein you win the overall Conflict by (eventually) succeeding at a 'tipping-point' majority of the tasks within that conflict).<br/><br/>1a. Going "all-in" on a conflict exhausts your pool of resources a little.<br/>1b. You also have the option, after the "reveal", to reallocate your resources to give yourself a better chance of success at a task where you realize you're outgunned.  This "desperate reaction" also depletes your resource pool somewhat, leaving your weakened for later Conflicts.<br/><br/><br/>Nobilis, which for me is a kind of proto-indie game (it has a whole section on Social Contracts that I read two years before I found the Forge) uses a very similar mechanic within both the hard-cover and smaller softcover "larp" rules for determining who beats who with their respective miracles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154486/#Comment_154486" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T13:38:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  1:38PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does TrollBabe apply?<br/><br/>You don't pay for success, but you can "buy" a re-roll.

When two players are opposed to one another, one player sets two possible outcomes of the conflict.  The other player applies one of those outcomes to his character and the other outcome to the opposing player's character.  Since at least one outcome involves succeeding at what your goal is (that's another rule), you can always get what you want, if you're willing to pay the cost.  But if the player setting the stakes really strongly wishes to oppose you, he could set both outcomes as really horrible, and accept the consequences to his character, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155432/#Comment_155432" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T11:31:27+00:00" title="July  8, 2008 11:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 11:35AM by Marshall Burns.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, how do Pace and NObilis work?

They are also, apart from a botched run of InSpectres, my first deliberate attempts at Narrativist play and involve a lot of difficulties as I tried to properly work out the difference between Bangs and Force.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26123.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26123.0</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26158.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26158.0</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26246.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26246.0</a><br/>\nThese three are accounts of sessions run by a guy named Wilmer who expressed interest in the game.

The last post in it by me indicates what rules are going to be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest version of the text (soon to be obsolete, so don't use it, k?) is here:  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/rustbelt5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/rustbelt5.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the game will be at GenCon as part of the Ashcan Front.

I haven't had a chance to check them out.</blockquote>\nNobilis works like this:  You have an attribute rated typically between 0 and 5.  This gives you a default value for doing stuff.  You also have a pool of points for each attribute.  These points raise your effective attribute rating (on a one for one basis, spend as many as you like at a time) for one action.  So if I had an Aspect of 3 (Aspect covers whatever a real human being can do, there are three other stats for other things) I could perform level 3 and below Aspect miracles for free, or I could spend one point to do a level 4 Aspect miracle, or two for a level 5 Aspect miracle, etc.<br><br>Uncertainty in conflict comes from not knowing your opponent's stat value, how many MPs they have and, most importantly, how many MPs they're spending in a given round.  Asyou can see, if someone really wants something, all they have to do is blow all their points on achieving that something.  Of course, since the points are a limited resource, doing so limits their ability elsewhere.<br><br>There's a lot more to Nobilis (like the simplified Ars Magica style miracle creation system, which tells you what level a given miracle is) but that's the core of the system.  I seem to recall Pace was vaguely similar.  I also know that Greg Stolze's <a href="http://gregstolze.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">...in Spaaace!</a> is a simple, free system built along similar principles.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155822/#Comment_155822" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T11:01:41+00:00" title="July 10, 2008 11:01AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nick,<br>Thanks for laying that out for me!
