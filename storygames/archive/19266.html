See, if I understand correctly, the Dogs in DitV are the ultimate authority in the game. (Sure, there are elders back in Dogs Central, but they're not going to appear in the position of authority over the Dogs.) This is true of Samurai, Gunslingers, Jedi, and so forth -- the roving person or band that is the law.<br/><br/>Delta Green is a little different, because the agents aren't using legitimate authority, but rather abusing what authority they have. This makes for a different feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429124/#Comment_429124" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T04:08:43+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  4:08AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is an undercurrent in DitV, though, that rings truer still in Delta Green: whatever your badge says, there's no backup in the field.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429134/#Comment_429134" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-05T07:00:59+00:00" title="March  5, 2014  7:00AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wonder whether the point in DitV is the tension between the PC's sure knowledge that they are "bringers of good" in a black and white universe and the gradual erosion/deconstruction of that knowledge in the face of human drama. Delta Green is about the tension between an endless conflict against unredeemable horror that must not be allowed to win, and the inevitable cost of collatoral damage as the DG team's first credo is Containment At All Costs (that is, humanity must be saved AND humanity must not know.)<br/><br/>To me these are different thematic tensions: they may seem the same because of the internal conflict that must play out in the protagonists, but I'm not sure they're tremendously compatible.<br/><br/>But I could easily be wrong: what about the DitV game system seems purpose-built to you to play out the DG kind of tension?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429162/#Comment_429162" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-06T07:38:57+00:00" title="March  6, 2014  7:38AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Viktor, I think you could rephrase DG themes to be inline with DitV. <br/><br/>DG's PCs are sure in the knowledge of their "bringing the good" in a black and white world of humanity vs. irredeemable horrors with the erosion of that line between good and bad gradually occurring due to human fallibility. <br/><br/>The easiest thing to do really is to alter the Delta Green fluff to fit the DitV mechanics, rather than the inverse.

The lower members of the cults might not even know what is going on but know enough to grow into something dangerous.<br/><br/>People just stumbling into the Mythos could be interesting too:<br/>But how to deal with someone dreaming of Mythos things and not conciously realising what he is doing yet? But he is spreading the Mythos still, by writing mathematical formula as in Dreams in the Witchhouse or sculpting and drawing terrifying imagery like in Call of Cthulhu.<br/>There also is posession by creatures from the outside like the Yithians and the Shan or on a smaller scale Asenath being posessed by her father's ghost. How do the agents handle someone like that?<br/>The King and Yellow and the Necronomicon can taint someones mind just by reading them, maybe the person will never be the same and the knowledge may never leave her. Still how do they contain that knowledge and what happens to the reader?<br/>A Deep One Hybrid is just born into their existence and might even be a good person, but their blood will call them to the sea sooner or later. Can the Agents kill someneone for what they might become? How sure are they? The hybrid seems like a nice enough person...<br/><br/>You could also play up the Men in Black aspect of Delta Green in their supression of knowledge and have them go against fellow investigators. Showing up to intimidate them into not having seen anything. Some Investigators might not take that though and still continue or they might allready know too much. Still they are on the same side maybe, fighting the Mythos. So how do the agents crack down on investigators like that? Journalists and Policeman maybe or just the usual COC player group of University Professors, Tribal Fisherman and Ex-Navy Seals.<br/>Do they recruit some of them? What if it goes wrong and they exposed those people to more knowledge? How long do they let the others go on to find out more about the true Mythos threat?<br/>Men in Black rarely are protagonists in most fiction. But here their intentions are good. Delta Green is protecting humanity after all. But what about the single person?<br/>The conflict between stopping knowledge and stopping the Mythos could be played up. With other investigators as possible helpful sources against the Mythos threat but also sinning in regards to secrecy. Choices might have to be made. Delay the Mythos or stop the knowledge...<br/><br/>The Delta Green backstory itself can be used too. There still is the Majestic 12 faction in the government that made a deal with the Mi-Go. So the agents might be cleaning up within the US government or the international secret service community. The sin in that case would be cooperation with the aliens. But some people might do it just because they got orders from above or because they genuinely want to help. Maybe they are not aware of the danger. Perhaps the Mi-Go aren't even all that malevolent. Still how far will the agents go against their own colleagues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429234/#Comment_429234" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T19:56:08+00:00" title="March  7, 2014  7:56PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Are they judging the <i>monsters</i>...or are they judging the people whom the monsters are infiltrating? </blockquote>\nWhen I first saw this thread, my reaction was: "What? This doesn't seem to fit together at all. I don't get it."<br/><br/>But now I think I see a possibility. It's not about fighting eldritch horrors, it's about dealing with the people who are slipping from a "correct" lifestyle into one which allows the horrors into our world.<br/><br/>When I play Dogs, I usually downplay the demonology stuff and just create problems like your brother who's going to see the prostitute, and isn't willing to stop.

The demon stuff was metaphor, at best.<br/><br/>So maybe that's why this didn't make any sense to me: where's the human drama in Delta Green?<br/><br/>However, if you make the analogy that all the Cthulhu-esque stuff in Delta Green is just a reskin of the demons in Dogs... then maybe I see a game here. <br/><br/>In the Dogs-verse, sin is the pathway which invites demons into human society.<br/><br/>What's the equivalent in this game?

Like, whenever someone says "I want to play <i>This Game</i>, but using the rules from <i>Other Game</i>," I think that one of two things is happening.<br/><br/>1: They really like the <b>premise</b> of<i>This Game</i>, but the rules aren't facilitating the themes or situations that come up at their table. So they think about the other games they own and pick one whose rules are a better match for their table's style. Then they get to use the setting but with a different playstyle.<br/><br/>2: They really like the <b>rules</b> of <i>Other Game</i>, and they want to use them more often. They wish <i>Other Game</i>'s rules applied to a different genre or playstyle that they really want to run, because the rules are just so awesome but the premise isn't grabbing them, or they're burned out on it.<br/><br/>The second scenario is the one I see more often and it usually leads to less compelling games, it's true. There's a million and one ApocWorld hacks because people want to make 7-9 lists for everything ever. But usually they don't <i>really</i> want to hack AW, they just want to keep using that ruleset for other genres. <br/><br/>So... if you've been playing Delta Green a lot and the rules are fighting your playstyle, and you've thought about what's missing and it's definitely DitV, then like HELL YEAH go for it. But if you've been playing or reading DitV and love the rules but want a fresh setting, then it'll probably be much more difficult and maybe not really what you're after?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429255/#Comment_429255" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T17:29:29+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  5:29PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2014 5:30PM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Vini's case, I'd definitely say it's the first clause.

Some areas where this might happen: paintings, mathematics, poetry, music. Like, there's a composer making stuff <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anNiw6Ghh8c" rel="nofollow">like this</a>, and that way lies the path to the Old Ones entering their mind and entering this world.<br/><br/>So, knowledge and expression that strays from the established norm, that's the sort of thing that lets the monstrosities gain a foothold in this world. And Delta Green operatives need to quash it. Maybe you start with missions where it's really overt (a professor has uncovered a mind-destroying theorem and is awakening an Old One), and then you move on to other missions where what they're doing is crushing human individuality and creativity in the name of saving us all.<br/><br/>And <b>that's</b> the spark that drives games like Dogs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429259/#Comment_429259" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-08T18:08:47+00:00" title="March  8, 2014  6:08PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Wait wait wait, DitV is objectively good so trying to utilise its rules elsewhere is badwrong?

If the Delta Green campaign dealt almost entirely with <i>people</i>, then DitV might work.

If you read the DG books and, specially, the fiction anthologies (like say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delta-Green-Theatres-Fiction-Collection/dp/1887797173" rel="nofollow">Dark Theaters</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delta-Green-Intelligence-Bruce-Baugh/dp/1887797092/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=12KZ9P5CGZA0792QHEWJ" rel="nofollow">Alien Intelligence</a> ) you will see most stories are about DG agents dealing with communities, cults or individual madmen trying to make contact with unspeakable horrors for knowledge/power/curiosity, or simply out of fear. The agents moral dilemmas are in dealing with <i>people</i> (not monsters) and the personal sacrifices they make because of that. In fact, if there is a central theme to DG, its personal sacrifice in name of duty. Further, the higher level DG agents are, in fact, psychological indoctrinated. They are not just "making their everyday job", they actually believe themselves as humanity true defenders, giving life on earth another couple years of survival for each unspeakable threat they push back to wherever it came from. Even if it means sacrificing other humans, their friends, relatives or even themselves. <br/><br/><i>Thats</i> what Delta Green is about. <i>Thats</i> why I thought DitV would be better vehicle for exploring its central themes than its default, theme-agnostic, system.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429284/#Comment_429284" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T20:06:21+00:00" title="March  9, 2014  8:06PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy cow, that <b>does</b> sound like Dogs.

Something in the rules about turning up the "dials?" I think you can literally gunbattle a Devil of Greed haunting the town's gambling den and still be well within the perimeters of by-the-book <i>Dogs</i>. What's important here isn't the literal or figurative nature of supernatural "possession" but that the possessing force has some desire to assault some core belief of the community (or, in DG's case, humanity in general) - because while, yes, you are defending humanity, you are really defending the ideals of that community (or, to complicate matters somewhat, <i>your </i>ideals <i>for </i>that community). If the Outsiders/Demons/Whathaveyou were just about killing folk then shooting them down willy-nilly would be easy, but it's really all about corruption and subtle coercion.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429381/#Comment_429381" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T11:41:14+00:00" title="March 11, 2014 11:41AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Interesting.

We're working to cover up the truth and make it appear like we did the right thing. It's more about appearances, more about politics, more about rationalizing a certain form of behaviour: making your superiors buy it, making the public buy it, and hiding the evidence of the rest.<br/><br/>I don't know if that hits me as hard, or if it plays to the strengths of the Dogs system.<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure about what I'm saying here, but this is my initial reaction.

The more obvious it is, the more you take the wind out of the game's sails. It's not impossible, but it has to be handled very carefully.<br/><br/>How does Delta Green deal with the Agents' level of authority? In Dogs, there's a keen sense that you're out there by yourself, and your decisions can't be gainsaid by anyone: sure, you're just a kid, but here you have to make the final call.<br/><br/>In something more like the "real world", it becomes much easier to appeal to authority or to delegate to higher-ups. For instance, if Doctor Heath is carrying some dangerous research and the dilemma is that people are going to lose their jobs if we shut it down, can't we appeal to the Unemployment Bureau (or whatever) to give those people a good severance package, or have them buy some kind of insurance, and then wash our hands of the matter?<br/><br/>None of this kind of business hits me in the gut the same way that the Dogs scenario does in just two or three sentences.<br/><br/>I hope that helps!<br/><br/>I think a further example with a lot more detail (for those, like me, not very familiar with Delta Green) would help this discussion a great deal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429385/#Comment_429385" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T13:44:34+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  1:44PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think uncertainty about the reality of the demons is necessary, though.

If, for reasons of imagery and metaphor, as GM, you want to give her murderous hatred a voice, a shadowy form, eyes staring from a dark place, you can. If you prefer to confine it to her voice, her form, her eyes, that works just as well. <br/><br/>Also, it's true that she married him and knew him as a human being, whom she would not always have murdered. Externalizing her hatred lets you display her struggle with it in vivid horrific color.<br/><br/>Either way, her hatred is what's true, and it's her hatred the Dogs have to confront.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429387/#Comment_429387" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T15:45:45+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  3:45PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no answers; only questions.

The narrator hangs back, cursing his own cowardice; a surgeon steps up and offers his little finger into the circle. The demon takes half his hand and departs. Is this the sort of choice you want? How much of this must come from (and go back to) the Character Sheet?

In Dogs, there's a keen sense that you're out there by yourself, and your decisions can't be gainsaid by anyone: sure, you're just a kid, but here you have to make the final call.<br/><br/>In something more like the "real world", it becomes much easier to appeal to authority or to delegate to higher-ups. For instance, if Doctor Heath is carrying some dangerous research and the dilemma is that people are going to lose their jobs if we shut it down, can't we appeal to the Unemployment Bureau (or whatever) to give those people a good severance package, or have them buy some kind of insurance, and then wash our hands of the matter?<br/></blockquote>\nDelta Green agents are members of an illegal conspiracy operating outside the bounds of their authority and typically committing a number of federal crimes in every "Night at the Opera" (the code for a DG operation). <br/>Should they ever attempt to turn over their problems to a higher authority, in the best-case scenario they will lose their jobs and be sent to prison for a very long time. More likely, if and when word of their activities reaches the Majestic-12 group, they will be detained without trial, tortured, killed, and buried where nobody will find them. <br/><br/>So the Unemployment Bureau is probably not going to be much help, unless the agents can pull strings to set things up nicely for Dr Heath and his employees without revealing why. That's at least possible, but the trick would be manufacturing a cover reason for the place to be shut down in the first place. <br/><br/>There's an odd balancing act at work in DG between the agents' genuine authority and the fact that they're basically bluffing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429392/#Comment_429392" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T16:56:56+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  4:56PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

There's no surprise if you come in to a branch and find the person in trouble is your cousin, or your sister in law. It adds that twist of the knife. With the Jane example, in Dogs Jane wouldn't just be 'some pregnant woman with a possible demon spawn in her', Jane would probably be your sister, or the woman who everyone said you'd marry when you grew up.<br/><br/>Is there a way to give Delta Green that level of attachment? Is the community of people who almost know small enough that the agents could have personal ties (a friend, a training buddy, an old professor) that would add that poignancy to the situation? <br/><br/>Alternatively, is it something that could be built up? The other push with Dogs is that the choice you make today decides the choice you are going to be given tomorrow. So in theory you could start with less personal situations and then slowly ramp them up. You make this decision when faced with strangers doing it, what decision do you make when it's slightly worse, but it's people you know? What if it's people you know and they tell you they have a really good reason for doing it? What if it's people you know and the really good reason they give actually sounds like a really good reason to you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429396/#Comment_429396" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T04:54:59+00:00" title="March 12, 2014  4:54AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say agents of Delta Green and their friendlies (people who are helping the conspiracy but aren't part of it. Either because they aren't working for the US government or because they aren't fully in the know or less trusted) are in a prime position to get into contact with the Mythos. So friends and colleagues of the characters can easily be drawn into the characters world.<br/>The Majestic 12 also is recruiting from the US government, so friends can be found on a different side of a secret war all of a sudden. And everything you told them might be used against you and Delta Green.<br/><br/>Friendlies do have a potential to give a close knit community too. They are the support network for Delta Green and under their protection. But of course DG has to keep an eye on them, they could turn any time. So the sheriff who helped you out a few cases ago now is making deals with the Mi Go to get back his abducted daughter. The professor who identified the rock from another planet has kept researching behind DGs back. The girl you saved from a cult compound is now slowly turning into one of the monsters you saved her from, but keeping her personality. Maybe another friendly just wants out and severs all contact with DG, can you risk keeping him and his knowledge out there or do you spoil his retirement?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429399/#Comment_429399" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T06:28:21+00:00" title="March 12, 2014  6:28AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ever get the feeling that there's nothing new under the sun? <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=12648.0" rel="nofollow">Delta Green in the Vineyard.</a> Look at the date.</blockquote>\nHot dang there's some awesome stuff in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429400/#Comment_429400" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T07:09:17+00:00" title="March 12, 2014  7:09AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That thread led me to create <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/201" rel="nofollow">Afraid</a>, which you might also find inspirational.

Let's make it a bit like the Dark Side: something which changes you, but drawing on it potentially gets you what you want.<br/><br/>I'd have to give a thought to when or how these things manifest, but, basically, losing some kind of sanity conflict (not too different from a healing conflict, perhaps) can have one of two effects, presumably as Fallout. (And perhaps these become an option as Fallout from any old conflict, as well, if it makes sense in that context.)<br/><br/>1. You can take Madness Traits as a Fallout option. These are things about you which change who you are: delusions, transformations, various psychological issues. Maybe you gain something like, "My focused stare causes panic in animals and children - 1d6".<br/><br/>First of all, these descriptive changes to your character accumulate and, over time, change who he or she is dramatically. They also form a bit of history of your character's psychic trauma over time. (And I like the idea of the Initiation being an incident which gives you your first Madness Trait.)<br/><br/>You can call on these Traits in conflicts, of course, but, since they are somewhat monstrous, it means revealing your twisted or warped nature. If you keep them hidden, you don't get the dice. If you let them show, you're more likely to get your way. Being weird and scary now becomes a temptation. You might use your focused, otherworldly stare to convince some children to perform some task for you, for example.<br/><br/>2. As a second option, the GM can take some kind of currency to represent you losing your grip on reality. This is not a change to your character that you're aware of and can control (like Madness Traits): this is reality slipping out of your grasp.<br/><br/>Let's call these Madness Dice. <br/><br/>The GM can spend these dice in play for various psychedelic effects. The bigger the die, the stronger the effect.<br/><br/>They manifest as:<br/>d4 - a minor detail, sufficient to creep out someone noticing, but you could easily think your eyes played a trick on you<br/>d6 - a significant detail, something you wouldn't forget, and clearly out of the realm of the ordinary<br/>d8 - a minor episode or hallucination, likely causing a frightening altercation if noticed<br/>d10 - a major episode, including dramatic harm or change to anyone affected<br/><br/>When the GM spends these dice, she *lies* to the player about what their character is doing, saying, or seeing. With minor details, it might be something innocuous, and the lie is just that the character is not aware of it. Perhaps some cockroaches have taken up residence in the character's coat, and occasionally crawl out onto his hands or face, only to disappear again. Other characters will see the roaches, but the character himself cannot - they do not exist in his reality.<br/><br/>Perhaps the agent's sister-in-law has been leaving phone messages on his answering machine... but the character does not remember them. He listens to them and erases them, with no memory of having done so.<br/><br/>More dramatic events or episodes manifest as character action. Perhaps the character is telling a story about something to a friend, or relating a weird dream, and doesn't realize that this story *actually happened*: they've made themselves forget that. (In play, we might have the character describe a dream, and then establish retroactively, when the die is spent, that this really happened.)<br/><br/>More typically, the character will experience hallucinations. The GM might describe a dead person - a revenant! - entering his home and threatening his life: perhaps the agent fights back and kills the intruder. We later learn that this was his sister-in-law coming to check on him, concerned that he's not returning phone calls. Now the agent has to figure out what to do with her mangled corpse. (Or perhaps he still doesn't realize what really happened, but remains convinced it was a revenant!)<br/><br/>In short, the GM can play with the agent's perception of reality by spending Madness Dice. <br/><br/>If this happens in a conflict, of course, the die becomes a Trait for the opposition - or the agent - as the GM deems fit. A cockroach crawling out from under your hat might help you convince someone to get out of your way, but it could also cause the librarian to panic and call the police.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429423/#Comment_429423" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-12T23:26:52+00:00" title="March 12, 2014 11:26PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Option 1, for me. <br/>You can play it safe and hide from what you know is true.
