I ended with some extremely bulky, grotesque beefboy with malformed hands and eyebrows with a wingspan. In game terms, this meant that I was extremely, horribly inaccurate with any weapon I could pick up; and that I could tote around heavy machineguns with ease.<br/><br/>After a bout of investigation that worked mostly off the resolution system of the game not mattering very much, we got to our first combat. It is at this point I learned that my platemailed ogre's one-in-five chance to hit, 20%, was modified into a 70% chance to hit, with opportunity for extra hits on certain results, all through situational modifiers and abilities inherent to the weapon. And, I'll tell you right now, this reignited my interest in the game, which by then ran mostly on finding new ways on describing just how bushy my guy's eyebrows were, quite substantially. What other guns can I find? How do I best make use of all these situational modifiers? Hey, can the party's noble spot me for this one cyberlimb?<br/><br/>Now, given where I'm writing this, you are very likely to be somewhat uncomfortable with your love of fictional violence and slight hint of gun fetishism, let me assure you that this isn't about the guns. Rather, lets treat this to hit modifier as an example of a generic resolution system.<br/><br/>The grand majority of effectiveness of my character in that situation was governed by gear and the situation, that is to say, factors extrinsic to the concept of what my character is like as a person. I generalize, and there are games where this sort of distinction does not apply at all, but it's certainly fair to say that in story games, the vast amount of mechanical resources that a character can muster have to do with their intrinsic qualities as a person. And I love how that sort of stuff allows you to align your attention to the tiniest bumps and changes in a character's life...<br/><br/>But, hell. I'm going to be paying a lot more attention to what's happening in the fictional <b>world</b> of WH40k, crunky as it may be, than I do in most story games, where the surroundings are often mere emotional backdrop of little significance.<br/><br/>The thing I'm most excited about here, though, is the fact that there's nothing about the idea of external factors being the main determinant of a player character's effectiveness that makes it have to be about guns n' corridors. It could be about people, groups, ecology, whatever you bloody please.<br/><br/><br/>So what do you guys think about this distinction? Am I wrong about story games abandoning world-effectiveness tracking design? If I'm not wrong, do you think there's something inherently incompatible with the sort of themes we like to explore at SG, or was it just a historical fluke?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469966/#Comment_469966" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T00:50:12+00:00" title="February 13, 2018 12:50AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2018 12:52AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have some thoughts in response to your questions, but first I gotta ask:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DWeird" rel="nofollow">DWeird</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>my platemailed ogre's one-in-five chance to hit, 20%, was modified into a 70% chance to hit, with opportunity for extra hits on certain results, all through situational modifiers and abilities inherent to the weapon. </p></div></blockquote>What were the situational modifiers?

OSR has been very popular here recently, and it's a kind of play style that for many is heavily skewed towards the environment rather than the characters' intrinsic qualities as people, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469970/#Comment_469970" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T01:58:13+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  1:58AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2018 1:59AM by DWeird.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What were the situational modifiers?

Or was your ogre in any way special in your ability to acquire/carry/activate/optimize this weapon?</p></div></blockquote>\nIs the general gist of your coming followup question that my battle ogre had special access to some of these situational modifiers and weapon stats, so in a sense, they're really part of intrinsic character effectiveness? If so, yeah, there's a sense in which that's true. But I still think there's a difference between character effectiveness as differentiated access to extrinsic effectiveness; and plain old intrinsic effectiveness.<br/><br/>If that stab in the dark didn't connect, here's a too-wordy good faith response:<br/><br/>Two situational modifiers were relevant at certain times of the combat, and they had to do with relative distance from the target: point blank range, +30%, which is the same for all classes of weapons, but which weapons with full automatic burst capability are better suited to take advantage (fully auto shots get an extra hit for every degree of success, an a degree of success = 10% over target number); and short range, +10%, which is defined as half of the full range of the weapon. Half the range of that particular heavy machinegun was 60 meters, which pretty much meant anything inside any room ever was going to be within short range.<br/><br/>There were certain restrictions on who can use the weapon: you need the appropriate training tag for any weapon, and mine was fairly heavily restricted in terms of the game's class system - very few other character types could have gotten access to it this early in the game.  There is also a weight component to it, that makes it impossible for anyone to carry it *and* effective armor at the same time. Finally, as part of the mutation package, my GM tossed me a special ability to be able to use this weapon without spending time setting it up first - you do not typically hip-fire heavy machineguns.<br/><br/>The part of the machinegun that is relevant for the purposes of to-hit resolution is the fact that it can do a full-auto burst, which gives a +20% to hit. There are other, less heavy duty weapons that have the same ability, and there are other ways to get equivalent bonuses with other types of weapons, but they interact with action economy differently.<br/><br/>Note, for comparison's sake, that +20 is the absolute cap of how far you can increase your character's intrinsic ability to shoot stuff through the point-buy level system, and the costs are prohibitive enough that it would take a good number of sessions to get there even if you ignored all other tracks of advancement, and even if your character class is specifically intended to be good at shooting stuff. They best way to increase effectiveness, generally, is to get the appropriate gear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469973/#Comment_469973" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T05:24:23+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  5:24AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DWeird, I hope you won't find this disappointing as a response, but I feel like there's not much to say here.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>I agree with all of it - yes, story- and character-oriented designs tend to deemphasize the fictional circumstances of the character in favour of the internal emotional state of the character (or things like that, things relevant to dramatic concerns).<br/><br/>Playing around with Simulationist (in the Threefold sense) mechanics can be really, really fun, for all the reasons you talk about here! I think a lot of game designers have lost interest in that kind of thing recently, except for more "boardgamey" designs (e.g. D&amp;D4E, Old School Hack). I think it's a lot of fun, and well worth revisiting!<br/><br/>So, in short, I think you're right on the money, but there's no surprise value in it for me - didn't we know this all along? Seems very straightforward to me, although if it's a fun discovery for you, then all the more power to you!<br/><br/>Your experience and your post serves as a great reminder, in any case, to remember the fun of Simulationist mechanics. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I see nothing wrong with that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469978/#Comment_469978" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T16:22:25+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  4:22PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2018 4:24PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, awesome!  I think that combo is my favorite scenario.  The character has his interesting bits, and the world has its interesting bits, and <i>those two sets are designed to interlock in various ways</i>.  For me, that last part is the key: \n<ul><li>Wandering around to see who's the first to pick up gear that's so inherently amazing as to render the particulars of the characters themselves irrelevant... I think that would demand maximum world-attention, but might become a "collecting game" that isn't much fun IMO.</li>\n<li>And then, just being intrinsically awesome completely misses that "attend to the world" thing we're talking about.</li></ul>\n"Here's a weapon that is badass <i>if</i> you are special enough to lift it, and even more badass <i>if</i> you are super-special enough to hip-fire it," is a great achievement to unlock.  And then maneuvering it into optimal firing range is a fun mini-game, to unlock the <i>full</i> badassery.  So the gun rewards you for finding it, also rewards you for being you, and then finally rewards you for playing with it skillfully in the moment.<br/><br/>I love traversing RPG environments filled with those sorts of toys!<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't see why things besides guns couldn't function as cool toys in an identical way.  "People, groups, ecology" -- these just need to be designed in such a way that they reward you for collecting them, for applying your unique strengths to them, and for employing them skillfully in the moment.<br/><br/>Example toy: nutty cult.  The cult can be acquired through some combo of telling them what they want to hear, making persuasion rolls, etc.  Once acquired, the cult can be set to do useful busy work if you have special abilities to inspire them, or they can be sent into combat if you have special abilities to impassion them.  Otherwise they're just a colorful feature that's useful when more hands are useful.  Finally, when you do send them into combat, they're most effective in their first round of attack, so you must carefully time when to impassion and unleash them.<br/><br/>Yeah?<br/><br/>I don't think rules-lite games are into this sort of thing, but there are a few games that are both crunchy and care about story, like Burning Wheel.  I don't see any fundamental opposition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469979/#Comment_469979" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T17:41:49+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  5:41PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Soooo...no one else reading this ever played the 40K minis game I take it?<br/><br/>Ogryns have been mobile HMG carriers since they first made miniatures of them a couple decades ago.
