Well, how about borrowed words? English is full of words that are not, strictly-speaking, English words. I'm not talking about words that have faded into the background over time (like "faded" and "borrowed"), but more like obvious borrows like "psychiatrist" and "antibiotic" (a lot will be scientific or medical terms).<br/><br/>The play I am proposing is this: take a word that is clearly (by your definition of "clearly") borrowed into English, break it down into its component parts, and say something about how it might influence a setting or story.<br/><br/>I'll start:<br/><b>Geographer</b><br/>Literal translation: <i>earth writer</i><br/>The great monoliths of the People were more than just their places of power, the sites of their ceremonies. They were the People's very history, written upon the face of the Land by forces beyond the comprehension of most. Only a handful of each generation found the calling of the Earth Writer, and they could not explain how their abilities worked. It was just something they knew, they said, just something they could do, without thought.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216375/#Comment_216375" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T11:22:25+00:00" title="July  4, 2009 11:22AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh, i like this idea, but i don't have a sweet compendium of lost words.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216376/#Comment_216376" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T11:28:12+00:00" title="July  4, 2009 11:28AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hmm,<br/><br/>how 'bout Pantheon<br/><br/>all-god-place<br/><br/>i could see this as a dive bar where avatars or old gods hang out, one of those bigger-on-the-inside-than-the-outside places.<br/><br/>or, in a fantasy setting, it could be a (fabled) valley wherein all folks who journeyed there recieved the powers of a god.<br/>of course, the catch would be that Everything there had the powers of a god, so you're really still on the same level as everyone<br/>else, now it's just extreme.
