It goes like this:<br/><br/>"I'm going to host a regular/weekly gaming night thingy.  I'm going to invite a bunch of people: 20 or so.  If you want in, you are not required to attend regularly.  When you do come, you need to bring two things: (a) a snack-or-drink to share, and (b) a game that can be played that night.  Yes, everybody will be bringing a different game, and we will have a 1:1 gamer:game ratio.  We will decide what to play that night, and not before.  We might split into two or more groups to play different games.  We might play multiple games in a row.  Some attendees might decide to pick up a game that they started on an earlier week and play the next installment.  The idea is simple: we're going to throw a lot of gamers and a lot of games into one place until something hits critical mass and play ensues."<br/><br/>So: if you received such an invite, would that interest you, or turn you off?  What, specifically, would grab you or worry you?<br/><br/>From our nice comfortable internet armchairs, can you see any potential problems in this set-up?  Any bright ideas on how to optimize the fun output?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108288/#Comment_108288" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T13:55:43+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  1:55PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea.

Our idea was to have a party that started around dinner time (5 or 6pm) and ran until about 2am. Get around 20 people who play games together, have a dinner, and have games organically start happening between the participants. Put a stress on simple, one-shot games and pick-up games, so that people can sink their teeth into 2-3 games over the course of the evening while still taking some time to talk and mingle.<br/><br/>The obvious pitfalls we came up with were:<br/>-RPG sessions will typically run 3+ hours, and people getting in more than 2 games might be tricky to manage.<br/>-What if we finish our game in 2 hours, and plan to play Unistat next... but Tony also wanted to play Unistat, and his game will take another hour to wrap up... what then?<br/>-Where would you hold such an event? Space for anywhere between 2-6 games being played simultaneously is a lot of space - there needs to be 2-6 tables or free floor spaces, and room in the place for 10-20 people to get in on these games.<br/><br/>So, those are all the thoughts we came up with for our similar idea. Hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108295/#Comment_108295" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T14:21:18+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  2:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an excellent idea Josh.

This puts some work on your part, but frankly, if you're organizing this you'll likely benefit from front-loading some of the snack stuff anyway.<br/><br/>On our Monday games, we typically have a rule of "bring what you want before you show up" -- sometimes people bring shit to snack on of their own accord, and that's pretty cool.  But there's no sense of irritation or begrudging when someone doesn't (though I do like it when someone picks up my food, since I walk home from work and the game's at my place).<br/><br/>I'd also suggest that if you lower the barrier of entry, you may find it easier to start up.  Then, should the need arise, you could address that as a group rather than as a leader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108311/#Comment_108311" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T16:32:13+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  4:32PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When it comes to the rules I think the snacks thing is more important than having a game ready to play.

Here's some of my observations:<br/><br/>Nearly everyone who attended had children, and child care became the burden of the spouse/partner who wasn't into gaming. It was not much fun for that person. My non-gaming husband had the right idea and came once. That said, there were lots of things for kids to do, but the age range was too vast: an infant, a few toddlers, and a few 5-9 year olds. I would have happily pitched in some cash for a babysitter or two.<br/><br/>We broke up into smaller game groups, but we didn't do many role playing games. There were plenty of people who would have, but it was just too chaotic, and not everyone who attended liked rpg's. We played things like Werewolves of Miller's Hollow, a Steal Away Jordan play test that went quite well, Mechaton, Exquisite Corpse, lots of card games, lots of board games, a few kid friendly games.<br/><br/>Doing this weekly would have sucked. Time suck, energy suck. I can't impose this on my kids and husband every Saturday, and if you ask people with children, I can assure you, you'll get that answer more than a few times. Once a month was good. <br/><br/>In the end, I didn't want to go any more. Even once a month, it was too stressful for my kids, I missed quality time with my husband, and it was too loud and chaotic for role playing games other than things like Werewolves of Miller's Hollow, (which is a fun party game and perfect for people who are and aren't into rpg's.) One of the problems was that it <b>was</b> just once a month. It was never on the same week in the month.<br/><br/>But the first few times it was fun. I think the whole thing lasted about six months, then the host got very ill, and after that people stopped coming.<br/><br/>If it were offered, I don't think I would do it again. I like the twice yearly <a href="http://www.jiffycon.com" rel="nofollow">JiffyCon</a>, which sounds a lot like what you want to do; and our regular gaming group, which is small and closed, and since it's held across the street, I can show up in my pajamas. That's just me. I have a lot going on, and I have to pick new commitments carefully. Other people who used to attend this game day also post here, and may have a different perspective.<br/><br/>What could have kept it going (IMO)<br/>*  A paid babysitter, with parents pitching a few bucks to cover the cost if necessary.<br/>*  More rpg's. A few sessions that people could commit to would have been nice. One shots make it fall apart because no one is invested in it.<br/>*  Better food organization. Some people didn't bring anything, not even a game to play. Six bowls of chips is better than one bowl of chips to feed 20 people. And it helps cohesion if people are expected to bring something: food, an idea, a musical instrument, anything! If it's agreed that people will pitch in a few $$ to order pizza or some other take out, that's cool, too. Food helps gaming.<br/><br/>I hope you're able to come up with something that works! It's a nice idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108320/#Comment_108320" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T17:11:15+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  5:11PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My 20-or-so prospective guests are presently childless, but that will probably be changing in the next two years.

I've been meaning to write up our experiences, so here's a good excuse.  Hopefully Dev, Nathan, Eric, and the other SG posters who have been involved will post their thoughts as well.<br/><br/>We started small, with basically just Dev, Nathan, and me + whoever showed up.  In the beginning we ran one game per week, all one-shots, basically just playing whatever indie games we hadn't gotten a chance to try out.  It started growing (but only after the first couple months) and soon we were running two games a week for about 8-10 people total.  We had a few regulars, besides ourselves, but we would tend to get a few new people each time, or people who would come once every few weeks.<br/><br/>Plenty of people have come once or twice and never come back.  I don't know if that's because they didn't enjoy themselves that much or because of scheduling issues.  We've also had a few people who've been regulars for a while but then quit on us.  Some of that, I know, is due to personality clashes between various people who participate.  I'm not sure what to do about that.  If there are some regulars who just don't get along, they either clash all the time or one/both of them eventually decides it's not worth the energy and leaves.<br/><br/>We had guest designers come in and play with us.  Jared Sorenson stopped by a half-dozen times.  Luke Crane's been through twice.  They brought other folks on occasion.  Thor might have been there once or I may be imagining that.  Clint Kraus came through.  Malcolm Craig stopped by before GenCon this year.  We hosted one of the JiffyCons in Boston (as opposed to Greenfield) and had Emily Care, Joshua Newman, and some other Western Mass folks join us.<br/><br/>We often playtested games, either stuff we ganked from the net or stuff we were individually working on.  Generally we played one shots, which was awesome at first (so many different games!) but gradually became less satisfying over time.  We began experimenting with different formats.  Dev ran a 2-shot of Hero's Banner.  Nathan ran a 3-shot of the Mountain Witch.  I ran 4-5 sessions of Afraid, with a few regular players and then other players who guest starred for a session here and there.  We began starting to run games outside of our normal Wednesday meeting time.  I ran a 3.5-shot of Cold City on Tuesday nights.  We're preparing to do more of that, I think.<br/><br/>Overall, we've had trouble connecting with other gaming communities in Boston, even though you can't throw a brick here without hitting a roleplayer.  I know of two other groups of gamers in town with whom I get along great with.  However, aside from a couple of people who've shown up at SGBoston events once or twice, it's hard to get people to intermix.  I'm not sure what the deal is.  Part of it, right now, is that me and Dev are the only real connections between these groups, so hopefully that'll change if we can start getting people to play together.<br/><br/>That said, we seem to have capped out at about... 10-12 regular participants?  The times when we've had more, like the few times when we had 20 people or so, it seems to be harder to manage and we eventually drop back down because we can't sustain it.  I wish I had a more solid grip on why that was.  A few folks have suggested having a more formal organizational system, where we elect officers and have a governing committee with individual responsibilities and such.  We might at least start having one or two officers or something, I don't know.  Hard to imagine that in our current informal system, honestly, but structure might enable us to handle larger tasks in a more organized manner and sustain people's investment.<br/><br/>Anyway, those are my initial thoughts.  Hopefully other SGB folks will weigh in on what has and hadn't worked for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108324/#Comment_108324" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T17:38:28+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  5:38PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>That is a good question, though: would this need timeslots?

I've had large games with friends (like a birthday party).  And, though it's board games, play times can still range from 1-4 hours, and that's just the more short form stuff (we usually write off things like Twilight Imperium unless the whole day is dedicated to playing it).  Basically, make the default "you're going to play one game" and go with that. If a group finishes early, it's up to them to decide to play again, play something else, hang out and chat, or say goodbye and go home.<br/><br/>I think it would be good to plan for four hour blocks, and cut it in half if need be.  So someone might have a game that will take under 2 hours. People can make their decision based on that (and perhaps have an idea what will happen in that second block).  If something turns out to be surprisingly short, or long, well I wouldn't try to plan too much around that.<br/><br/>However, one pitfall we have is "What the hell do we play?"  We didn't even have 20 people, we usually have less than a dozen. And no more than a third had an idea of what they wanted to play.  And even then it was "Anything" or "Anything, except this and this". Everybody else was "I don't know any of these games, so whatever!" Eventually, a couple of us just had to take a stand and say "This is what we're playing" and then "Who's with us?" And our group was defined, and then the remander had to decide their game. With a larger group, I can see that being a chain reaction of people splitting off saying "We're playing this" and then those left have to decide who among them is in the next group, and so on.<br/><br/>You'll really need someone (or someones) to take charge and help decide what gets played. Otherwise, you'll have 20 people not playing anything. And you'll need to make sure the groups break down into workable components so you don't end up with the last group of people in too small a number to play anything they brought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108325/#Comment_108325" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T17:40:02+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  5:40PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>Doing this weekly would have sucked.</blockquote>\nTo offer an alternative position, doing it weekly helped us remember that we had this thing we did.

It worked very well for upwards of six months.  In a fit of irony, what killed it was the PTA game talked about in that post.  The game itself went very well, but the 5 sessions in a row with the same people, playing one game, killed the utility of the list: it just dropped off too many people's radars as an option for a Thursday night.  There were one or two evenings after The Belt that worked, but ultimately it faded into obscurity.  Take of that what you will.<br/><br/>I will likely reboot it in a couple of years; the kids are in an age range right now where it's an excessive amount of effort to be host and organizer and single parent.

We don't play exclusively indie and story games, though that's what's started it; but probably two-thirds of the games are indie, and nowadays even our "trad" games are heavily infused with scene-setting, distributed authority, and other story game techniques.  Daniel, I hope we'll see you there more often!  It's a little different from what Joshua is proposing in that it's more club-based and we don't have a requirement for people to bring games.  Here is a link to our notes on <a href="http://ecgf.wikidot.com/weekly-short-shots" rel="nofollow">putting together this sort of weekly game</a>.<br/><br/>I would probably not insist that everyone bring a game, but I wouldn't be dead-set against it either.  I know that some people are not comfortable with the idea of even hosting a GM-less game; and a 1:1 player:game ratio is definitely way more than we'll ever need.  Right now we're trying to stabilize at two games a weeks, and that's enough of a challenge.  I also find it's often easier to recruit if you can tell people what will be played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108393/#Comment_108393" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T10:26:14+00:00" title="November 15, 2007 10:26AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anemone, that was a really useful link.
