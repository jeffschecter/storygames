Your soul stays where it is, with the implication that your sins erode your soul forever.  If you go back to your own ways, you get a new sin: backsliding, and your devil jumps back up to where it should be.<br/><br/>If you die with 0 devil, you can go to heaven, otherwise it's a contest between soul and devil.  The outcome is peaceful rest and directly to hell.  That's after you check to see if you'll become a ghost or not.<br/><br/>The best first taste I can think of for Poison'd is this: The first decision you make about your pirate is which of a list of a dozen sins he's committed.  In there are rape, murder, idolatry, adultery, and blasphemy.  Two of your stats depend on the decisions you make.  Something to a game that right up front asks you: "So, is you character a rapist?  A murderer?

It's about sinning. If that distinction makes sense.<br/><br/>The players make it happen by using the game system. Everything always comes to a fight, says the rules. When you end up in a fight, you want X's on your sheet. More X's means more power in the fight.<br/><br/>To get X's, you want your character to do stuff that requires dice rolling. When you win dice rolls, you get X's. When you lose, the GM can bring the fight right then.<br/><br/>So, what stuff can you do that will give you a chance to win the dice roll? You look at your stats. Most of the time, your pirate is really, really good at hurting others and being a treacherous bastard. If you do those things, you will probably win some X's and have a chance to survive when the King's men come for you -- or your crewmates decide to toss you overboard (or much worse things).<br/><br/>So it's a pretty vicious cycle. A fight is always right around the corner. You need X's for the fight. You need to be a no good nasty pirate to get those X's. Or do you? How much do you care about <i>this</i> fight? How much do you care about your rapid slide into villainy? You get to decide, and take your lumps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89965/#Comment_89965" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T21:28:39+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  9:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played at SGB on Wednesday and it totally bombed in play, though character creation and the resolution mechanics were solid and really fun.

If the PCs are working together, they are using the Captain's (if there's no Captain, whoever is leading the foray) dice, and the Captain can distribute dice to those claiming they'll help.  Each die given out gives the helping player two dice to roll.  My suggestion, again, just having played and not read the book, make the opposing side outmatch the leader's dice so that help is <b>required</b> to have a shot at winning.  This also opens up for players withholding their help (not rolling after taking the dice), risking group success for their own benefit (they get X's).<br/><br/>*I say as few as possible, because, we were chasing down two merchant vessels, and since each one was trying to escape and survive, each one was seperate.  We couldn't chase down both at the same time.  So, figure, however many of the NPCs the PCs can fight at once, that's how many should be lumped together.  In a typical fight, a bunch of mook sailors would be one group, I think.<br/><br/>As for what else to do.  We found the drive to debauchery was natural.  You get X's to help out in fights by being a nasty pirate.  One player had the highest soul at the beginning, with the apparent intention to be our moral center (went by the moniker of "Father" and leading us in worship of the sea gods).  By the end, he was murdering helpless passengers and trying to cut off my hands (which I almost accepted to improve my brutality!).<br/><br/>After the Resolute, longer term play is up to the players, trying to accomplish their ambitions.  I wanted to Own Land, Live Forever, and Spit in God's Eye.  Only the last one came close to happening (as far as I can tell).  If we were going to play a second session, or had time to continue, we were set to raid a Governer's town and steal his daughter to achieve the ambitions of two of the characters.  We also got a taste of Leisure and were ready to attack more ships in order to get some decent shore leave (enough to buy fine clothes and get into high society parties to accomplish other ambitions).<br/><br/>So, after the initial scenario is dealt with, the pirates go on to pursue their ambitions, rape, murder, and steal, get hunted down by even more British ships, die and become ghosts cursing and blessing their former shipmates, or perhaps even try to find some redemption.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90214/#Comment_90214" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T13:53:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  1:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the advice, Alvin.<br/><br/>How did you actively pursue "Spit in God's Eye" or "Spit in the Devil's Eye"?

I'm sure that there are other ways, but both the Deadly wound rules and several of the Cruel Fortunes offer you opportunities to "interact" with them directly.

As long as I'm getting my questions answered, here's some more:<br/><br/>1) A couple times, a pirate declared that they were going to flat-out shoot another PC.  In the rules, the gun escalation goes a) show your weapon, b) point your weapon at them, c) fire your weapon.  How do you just cap a fellow crewman?  Can you just escalate however you want?<br/><br/>2) When we played, the incentive for gaining Xs through, basically, task resolution was not there or was just really boring.  People just wanted to get on with pillaging or killing each other.  Gaining Xs during the downtime between conflicts didn't really happen because there wasn't really much downtime between fights and raiding and whatever.  I could see how this could potentially be a kind of pacing mechanic, incentivizing players and GMs to have a few scenes in between conflicts, but I'm not sure that's exactly what Vincent has in mind.  In any case, my players were constantly entering conflicts without any Xs.<br/><br/>3) This is related to 2.  I've been so used to playing games with strong scene-framing guidelines that Poison'd really threw me for a curve.  Maybe I've forgotten how to be a strong GM in a traditional mode.  How did you deal with things like scene-framing and providing adversity and things like that?  Did the GM just aggressively frame everything?  Did the players ever frame or request scenes?  Did the players ever invent their own opposition ("Hey, so there should totally be dark clouds on the horizon!") or was it all GM created?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90237/#Comment_90237" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T14:46:13+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  2:46PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Thanks for the advice, Alvin.<br/><br/>How did you actively pursue "Spit in God's Eye" or "Spit in the Devil's Eye"?

When I later murdered four Englishmen for that purpose (since someone else killed Tom Reed), I figured it was a step along the way - working with the Devil certain seems like spitting in God's eye.  I really like Piers' explaination, though, and prefer that. I'm not sure if the books says how this is done, my guess it's left up to the players.<br/><br/>1) Yeah, just escalate all the way to c.  Think of each escalation as a slow motion drawing, aiming, firing.  If the other guy doesn't have a gun, say he only has his fists to fight back with, then the fists escalation determines what you're risking. Or Swords, or whatever.  If you win, he's dying, if you lose, you only have a bump on the head.<br/><br/>2) We had this problem too.  We went around beating up on our own crew since nothing else was available to get X's from.  Part of the problem was that we didn't optimize our characters. In order to do the proper actions, we didn't have many options where there was a chance of winning X's.  I'm a little disappointed that some character "builds" do seem better than others, but it also helped drive us into sin so we could really imbalance those scores to have a better shot at rolling for X's.  I too hope for more guidance, though, on what's expected to happen in between fights.<br/><br/>3) Judston set up the merchant ships that we hunted down, and kept rolling the die for the Resolute to show up when things got slow, but outside of that and the results on dice conflicts, we did most of the framing.  Especially before and after fights, whether that was randomly punishing crew members to get X's, or abusing prisoners from the merchant vessels.  I think the only thing we asked of our GM was whether or not there were women on the second ship (which he gave to us). The scenes mostly served to highlight our sins, commit further ones, or for character color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90238/#Comment_90238" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T14:48:25+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  2:48PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jonathan,<br/><br/>There's no general conflict resolution in Poison'd. There are success rolls, and there are fights. Players can't call for a fight -- that's the GM's job. The GM may call for a fight when a player makes a success roll and takes no advantage from it (by tying or losing the roll).<br/><br/>So, there's no "between conflicts" period, exactly. The PCs take action to pursue their ambitions and when they're being brutal, treacherous, going into danger, or enduring duress, you roll dice. So when you say, "People just wanted to get on with pillaging or killing each other," it makes me think that you wanted to always have a "conflict" over that stuff. That's not quite right. You can say, "I push down the old priest and strip every bit of gold from the altar," and if you succeed at your brutality roll, you do it. If you don't, you lose your nerve, and/or the GM brings the fight right then.<br/><br/>Does that help at all? I'm not sure if I'm on the right track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90241/#Comment_90241" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T14:57:11+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  2:57PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, I think you are on exactly the right track.<br/><br/>Vincent has a Q&amp;A thread up on Anyway, right now, but this bit from the introductory post pretty much says what John just said, only more exactly:\n<blockquote>2. There are a couple of key things the GM needs to know and remember to do. These are the "roll dice or say yes" of Poison'd.<br/><br/>2a. Whenever the players look kind of blank, say out loud the four things they can do to get Xs for the upcoming fight (there's always an upcoming fight):<br/>* Go into danger (Devil vs Ambition);<br/>* Use deceit or treachery (Ambition vs Brutality);<br/>* Attack someone helpless (Brutality vs Soul);<br/>* Endure duress (Soul vs Devil).<br/>"Those are the four things you can do. Which do you want to do?" Then help them find or create the opportunity to do the one they choose. Don't forget about flashbacks.<br/><br/>2b. Pretty soon, one PC pirate is going to attack another. This is awesome. Have the first player roll Brutality vs Soul for her Xs for the attack (if appropriate). Then say to the second player: "okay, so he clubs you in the head / stabs you in the back / heaves you over the side. Do you want to bring the fight or endure duress?"<br/><br/>Ask the player if her pirate is enduring duress. Ask it whenever it seems to you that he might possibly be, or might possibly could. This is the best technique in the game. It turns a horrible situation for the character into an opportunity for the player, getting the player to buy into her character's suffering.<br/></blockquote>\nThe other thing I'd note is that it is worth looking carefully at the Cruel Fortunes and seeing how they dove-tail with each other.  In many cases they directly suggest what should happen next, particularly in the context of the Prizes section in Opportunities.  In combination Cruel Fortune and Opportunities offer all the macro-level actions that the players can take.  When I run the game, I'm tempted to print out each of these on a separate index card to remind me what I can do and what the players can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90243/#Comment_90243" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T15:02:34+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  3:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

Like I say, Mountain Witch territory.<br/><br/>That's why you'd play it, if you wanted to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90367/#Comment_90367" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T09:07:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  9:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2007 9:19AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Vincent, <br/><br/>Now I want to play.<br/><br/>Thanks for clarifying the bits about danger, duress, and stealth and care.<br/><br/>Final question: <br/><br/>I fell asleep thinking about this stuff (yes.... I know).  I'd heard mention that this was <i>Reservoir Dogs on the High Seas</i>, but that analogy doesn't jibe with me yet.  <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> isn't about a bunch of criminals.  Our point of view character in that movie is a many trying to be a good cop.  He is a man with a conscious trying to bring down the bad guys.
