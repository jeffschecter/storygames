I have a cold and and am woozy. (I had to pass on all of last night's post-con festivities.  I lounged in bed for three hours, and then slept for 10 in an effort to hit my real life running tomorrow morning.)<br/><br/>Delights of the convention:<br/><br/>Bumping into old friends I had lost contact with: Mike Nystul, Jordan Weisman, Bill Slavicsek, Mark Nau, and others.<br/><br/>Meeting all sorts of folks I'd communicated with online but had never met before.  If I spoke to you, you know who you are.<br/><br/>A terrific conversation with Paul Czege about the new game he's working on that found us wandering in a large winding loop from one end of the convention hall to the other and back again<br/><br/>A terrific conversation with Jake Norwood about the nature of ethical sociopaths and the difference between corporate management techniques and Army management techniques that started at the convention center, continued as we walked to a bar, then continued as we walked to the Embassy Suites, then continued as we walked back to his hotel to pick up his copy of Riddle of Steel, then continued as we as walked back to the Embassy Suites and finally ending when we settled down to play a game.  <br/><br/>Playing Gregor Hutton's <i>316 AD</i> -- with Gregor Hutton running the game. And, in general, shooting the shit with Gregor Hutton.  A great guy.  And he wears plaid shirts and camouflage shorts, so he's like a walking tab of LSD.  Gregor's descriptions of the grit and grime and pissin' rain of Scotland will stay with me a long time. The game was great, with lots of fun folks... but I have to say that the head-butting between Brennan Taylor's lazy, cowardly commander and my stern, reliable legionnaire was a highlight of gaming for me.  It climaxed in Brennan's character finally stepping up to the plate at the last second in the last battle -- just as I decided to try to frag him with a well place spear toss... Great stuff.  I think the game is a terrific piece of work.<br/><br/>Playing Riddle of Steel with Jake Norwood running the game.  I'd read it, but never had a chance to play it before.  A real treat with, again, great players.  And derived stats!  It was like stepping into a mass done in Latin.  The combat system really is as intriguing as every said.  And, specifically for me, really nailed down the moment-by-moment color of the fights.  I had to leave early because of an early breakfast meeting, but I had a blast.<br/><br/>Having Luke Crane come up to me the morning after the Riddle of Steel game and say, "So. I heard you fled that Riddle of Steel game like a little girl."<br/><br/>The demo I played of Kagematsu with the game's designer, Danielle Lewon.  played a very innocent girl in the demo, who explained her love of a tapestry to Danielle's wandering samurai.  I found myself touched by the innocent girl's innocence -- she was so sweet! -- no the type of character I usually play. A terrific bit of design using simple mechanics that evoke strong emotions.<br/><br/>Helping to sell a copy of Mouse Guard when I was hanging out at the Burning Wheel booth.<br/><br/>Running the <i>Sorcerer</i> Boot Camps at The Forge booth.  I had two types of participants: those who hadn't played before, and those who had "but things really didn't work out."  It was the second type that I enjoyed the most. I'd lay out how the GM sets up the game, runs character creation, and then play.  Their eyes would light up and they'd go.... "Ohhhhhhhhhh!"<br/><br/>Jordan Weisman walking me around the booth of <a href="http://arcanelegions.com/" rel="nofollow">Arcane Legions</a>, his new miniatures game, and handing me a starter pack, the Roman and Egyptian calvary packs and and the Roman and Egyptian infantry packs to give to my nephews.  I had told him that Ben and Graham love Heroscape and he said, "Oh, this game is going to blow Heroscape out of the water.  Here, let's set your nephews up."  (Sweet, right?)  To his credit, the game is really cool. Jordan's game design has only been getting more specific and more elegant over the years.  As Jordan said to me, "Look, when we buy a miniatures game, we buy it because we want LOTS of armies sweeping toward each other -- but the mechanics of most games make those battles too annoying to play."  He's created a sweet miniatures game of epic battle with mechanics that make the miniatures and their unit bases part of the hit points and attack/defense mechanics.  I highly recommend checking it out.<br/><br/>Finding people who love the show DEXTER as much as I do.<br/><br/>Sitting down at the IPR booth's table and having a guy who had just published his first game give me the run-down.  It was just awesome remembering that feeling -- but being on the other side.<br/><br/>A great conversation with Emily Care Boss about games, fiction and the value of boredom.  (I said, "Boredom is good, because it prompts players to step up the game with more fiction."  I'm not sure if Emily agrees with me, but it crystalized something I'd been thinking about for a while.)<br/><br/>Getting a good night's sleep last night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225129/#Comment_225129" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T12:09:00+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 12:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoyed a lot and missed a lot.

The trick to that game, I think, is a willingness to be emotionally demonstrative if not emotionally vulnerable; I wish I'd twigged to that sooner. There's an interesting structural parallel between MLWM and Ganakagok in the rotating spotlight on PCs, which in the former emphasizes the distance between the characters but in the latter highlights their connectedness. <br><br>Speaking of Ganakagok, one awesome thing was running it at the Embassy Suites for Simon Rogers, Tony L-B, Steve "gbsteve" Dempsey, Brennan Taylor, and Anna Kreider. There were some really excellent moments in the fiction, which culminated in a titanic battle with the Father of Walruses in which Anna's warmongering zealot perished as the ice upon which they battled shattered beneath the weight of the monstrous creature, and Tony's crazed and lovelorn madwoman drowned swimming out to help Brennan's oathbound hunter. It was a nice climax to a fun game. <br><br>I saw Tony running a ton of Misery Bubblegum, and got him to do his demo for me. It's really cool. I particularly enjoyed the cards that let you offer a pointed choice to a character to which they must pick one or the other or flee; I used that trick Sunday morning to challenge a Ganakagok player's shy apprentice shaman: the People were placating the bloated animals of the island with their own food, and it wasn't enough. So the animals demanded human flesh. When the head shaman refused, the animals killed and ate him, and then turned to the shy apprentice. "Do you accede to their demands?" I asked the player (who was having a tough time coming up with something) "Or do you refuse?" The player hesitated, and I remembered Tony's trick: "Or you could run away." The player--whose name was Dylan--seized on that. "That's what I do." And from there the rest of the game spun out. It was sweet.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225167/#Comment_225167" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T13:51:39+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  1:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, you guys, that doesn't sound so. . .well, OK, that sounds pretty awesome. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Just ask next time you borrow the keys, OK?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225178/#Comment_225178" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T14:28:20+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  2:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel better rested and more focused right now than I have in months.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225308/#Comment_225308" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T03:24:57+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  3:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill's game of Ganakagok certainly was a highlight for me.

Big shout out to Eppy!<br/>* Eating, drinking, and socializing with people more than gaming. Too many people to name. But you are all the reason I come to these conventions.<br/>* I didn\u2019t realize Keith Senkowski, Alexander, and Brennan were going to be at Gencon. It was great seeing them!<br/>* Luke Crane going back through his list of "making games" and inserting the word "love" after designing and before publishing.<br/>* Jared\u2019s Action Castle!!!!!!!!!<br/>* All of Jared and Luke\u2019s seminars. Strangely they went from \u201cwe kick your ass\u201d to \u201cwe give you lots of hugs\u201d. <br/>* Playtesting Kevin\u2019s new game.<br/>* Amy\u2019s Empire of Dust looks fabulous!<br/>* Meeting over 8+ new people at Gencon that live in NYC! Some who have used nerdnyc to find their gaming groups and I have never heard of them!<br/>* Running Dogs in the Vineyard and Mouse Guard for people at Paizo and Wizards. I was bombarded with questions about the indie scene. And they kept coming back to me with games they bought from IPR\u2026 run\u2026 now! I did feel a bit like a dancing monkey! <br/>* Phil and I took turns roleplaying as Robin Laws to perfect my pitch for Monkey Dome.<br/>* The costume contest was grand. Our friend dressed up as the Lady of Pain!<br/>* Terrorworks was super fun. I would do it again next year. It was a LARP where you ran around shooting mutant monsters with airsoft pellet guns. <br/>* Winning Paizo\u2019s Dungeon Delve!<br/>* The Rio Grande room was top notch. No hard sell. Plenty of games and space to play. Free food!<br/>* The Fantasy Flight, EA, and Bioware booths were loud and exciting!<br/>* Battlepods!<br/>* Met Brendan who owns a candy store in Texas run by carnies! And he GMed a bad ass Call of Cthulhu game with some of better looking handouts I\u2019ve seen in a while. <br/>* This is the first Gencon after my sleep apnea was fixed. I was so full of energy I stayed up till 3-5am every night! <br/><br/>Sadnesses:<br/><br/>* I spent barely any time at the Embassy Suites. I feel like I missed out big time.<br/>* I didn\u2019t see Paul Czege once! I only saw Ron once. And apparently I was standing twice next to Joe McDonald and didn\u2019t realize who he was. Rahr!<br/>* I didn't play any demos.<br/>* We tried getting people to play Marvel Superheroes and there was definitely a strong anti old game vibe we received from many of the people we approached. At least 4 people had a \u201cno way, you still play that\u201d reaction. <br/>* Seeing Quickstart rules for large published non free games win best free game at the ENnies. Very lame. I talk to several people behind the scenes and there is a good chance this will not happen next year. <br/>* I like Dominion but I was sad to see it win the Dianna Awards. We played it a few times and figured out enough chain combos that someone\u2019s turn would go on and on and on. <br/>* I played with a lot of disruptive players. We usually stick to the indie and cthulhu scenes where the ratio of disruptive players in the past has been low to non existent. <br/>* Leaving early on Sunday. We missed so many dinners and parties, I was bummed on the way home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225507/#Comment_225507" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T14:58:47+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  2:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>* Running Dogs in the Vineyard and Mouse Guard for people at Paizo and Wizards.

There was good, but not enough good to make the trip worthwhile.<br/><br/>What was good:<br/>I got to forge really good relationships with the people at Design Matters (Nathan, Kevin, Eppy, Amy, Gregor) and re-connect with some additional people I think are cool (Ron Edwards, Paul Czege, Paul Tevis, Danielle, Emily C-B, Brennan, Tony L-B, Alexander Newman).<br/>I got to meet some cool new folks (Anna Kreider, Dro, Mick...on second thought, I'm not going to list them).<br/>I got to pass out review copies of Ribbon Drive to Robin Laws (who posted a shout-out that same evening) and to Ken Hite, as well as put some in the hands of Eero and IPR.<br/>I got to learn how to work in a relaxed, come-to-us, low-pressure environment (ie, Design Matters).<br/>I got to play Misery Bubblegum.<br/><br/>The rest of the stuff that was good (seeing Ryan Macklin, Zach Greenvoss, Tony Dowler, meeting Zach's friends, playing the game of Shock: with Zach and his friends, playing Ribbon Drive with the same crew, being away from home and having the road trip experience) I could have easily done without Gencon there. I could have invested that same budget in catching a bus to Seattle and Portland, and it would have been better. I would have had fewer costs, less travel time, more comfort, better food options, less heat, more sleep and fewer annoying people to weed out to get to the good ones. So, I'm going to just go ahead and acknowledge that these particular "high points" would have happened without Gencon.<br/><br/>So, what was bad:<br/>1.) Indianapolis smells like urine and is muggy and I don't ever want to go outside.<br/>1b.) Simultaneously, I hate spending whole days inside without a breath of fresh air.<br/>2.) I searched extensively for fruits and vegetables. There's no grocery store in the downtown core, according to hotel staff and my own investigations. You can buy bananas at Einstein's Bagels, but that's it for fruit (except for buying small bottles of juice, usually at a $2-4 price point). I managed to order a grand total of three meals with any real vegetables: one had rotten lettuce in the salad (no lie), one cost me $17 for a salad with chicken in it (Palamino's, and obviously I don't want to pay that much for some greens), and one was a cheap, good salad (<i>Omni-Severen's hotel coffee shop has good, cheap salads!</i>). Note that all of the vegetables I ate were in simple salads - that was all I could find.<br/>3.) My hotel and travel costs were really high.<br/>4.) I was delayed in the Indy airport for 2 hours flying out, and subsequently missed my connecting flight and spent the next 24 hours in the Chicago airport on standby with hundreds (literally) of other displaced travellers.<br/>5.) I managed to get in a grand total of 5 games over 4 days. 3 were good, and of those 3, 2 were with Portland folks. I didn't go primarily for play, but nevertheless I felt let down by how inaccessible play was. Games on Demand was a huge hike for something that might or might not pay off. Having to buy and use tickets for everything was yet another expense when I was strapped for cash already.<br/>6.) This is a super expensive convention. The combination of badge + generic/event tickets is super price-y, it's in the most costly season for travel and hotels, there's nowhere to buy groceries, booths are expensive, food is overpriced.<br/>7.) I don't feel like Gencon is "my people". I feel like certain localized parts of Gencon are "my people" (booths: Design Matters, Pirate Jenny, The Forge, IPR; gaming: Games on Demand, Embassy Suites), but there's a lot of weeding out to find them. I don't get a sense of community from the place, which is a big part of what I look to cons for. I didn't feel like talking to the average person who I bumped into or stood in line with. I didn't want the average person to talk to me.<br/>8.) I felt exhausted throughout. As already mentioned, the heat and lack of nutritious food was an issue that probably contributed to this. Also, 4 day length.<br/>9.) People who weren't there that I would have liked to see again or meet: Meg Baker, Vincent Baker, John Harper, Jason Morningstar, Clinton R. Nixon, Remi Treuer, Shreyas Sampat, Elizabeth Shoemaker, Malcolm Craig, Joshua Newman, Judd, Fred Hicks, Rob Donahue, Ben Lehman, Andy K, Guy Shalev. In short: a lot of the people that come to mind when I think "story games" weren't there, and this was a sad thing.<br/><br/>In short: Everyone should know that Go Play NW is the best convention I've ever seen, it runs in late June, is in the gorgeous Seattle, has a great community feel, is a great size (~40-80), and costs $40 (with no need for "event tickets"). Gamestorm is a cool convention at the end of March in Portland (well, just outside), has lots of variety, a good sized indie contingent (~40 people, maybe up to 100?), has a small dealer hall that gets some traffic, and is tons of fun. I invite you all to those, because I want to see you but don't know that Gencon will be worth the investment again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225529/#Comment_225529" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T16:21:50+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  4:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/><br/>You're describing more-or-less my exact feelings upon my first Gen Con.
