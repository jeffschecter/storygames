I'd never thought of the Lady Blackbird system as being suited to PvP before, so I'm interested to see how this plays. I also found gathering dice from tags to be frustrating, and the changes might make that worse (or I might be missing something).<br/><br/>But it's exciting to finally have a new installment!

When I played Blackbird, one of the things we struggled with was the whole dice-collecting thing - it just seemed kind of slow, and it was tempting to just say "Hey, take as many dice as you want if you think your Tags apply", just to get a move on. What does it look like at your table? Do you ask questions and discuss the situation, or try to learn more about the character(s)?<br/><br/>Also, what's the design intent behind the new layer (Identity+Trait+Tags, instead of just Trait+Tags)?  Not having played it, I'm not sure whether it makes characters more focused and powerful, or more versatile.<br/><br/>It's really fun to see another Lady Blackbird adventure, although I also find it somewhat disappointing not to see any direct links to the original. I think if I were to play this, I'd make the twins relatives of Natasha Siri, or the Magister a scion of House Blackbird, or something similar, just to remind us all that we're "playing in the same universe".<br/><br/>I love the new map! It's cool to see a rehash of the same territory, but with a different focus.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442431/#Comment_442431" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-03T17:09:38+00:00" title="February  3, 2015  5:09PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2015 5:09PM by James_Stuart.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">@AMBayard</a> It would feel a little weird to have a Snargle cameo!

In Magister Lor, it takes a triple-masted sky ship 12 weeks to cross the solar system. The Owl could make that trip in half the time.

Often, pulling dice means something gets clarified or added to the ongoing fiction. "Yeah, actually I am gonna add 'Tough', too. We're grappling at the edge of the platform, right? Twisting around and crashing into the lamp-posts and battering each other."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442449/#Comment_442449" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T05:21:54+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  5:21AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442452/#Comment_442452" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T13:15:59+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  1:15PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is looking good.

We played 4 and half hours, in two sessions. I never played a full game of Lady Blackbird, so I can't compare the experiences.<br/><br/>One drawback was the refresh scenes. Our refresh scenes were flashbacks, but I didn't manage to put the roleplay in front, the players mostly explained things important things on their characters without really inserted this revelations in the refresh scenes. I think next time, I would just say it's a scene of calm and see what we will learn, at least for the first refresh scenes. Maybe I will search some examples of refresh scenes in movies or TV series (like the scene in Return of the Jedi where Luke revealed to Leia that they are family and asked about their mother).<br/><br/>Now the AP:<br/><br/>A terrible storm permitted Kel to infiltrate the Magister's sanctum. Lor was confined to bed by his illness, but he sensed a magic perturbation and sent his apprentice Kai in the astrolabe to investigate. The young man discovered that the source was below, something was amiss with the crystal prison.<br/><br/>A weak Magister Lor, helped by Kai, went down to the platform where was the crystal. Hearing Setarra sung to call leviathans, Magister asked Kai to go fetch their star-metal swords and went to face the demon alone. He interrupted the song, but Setarra took the ascendant, when she revealed that she was responsible for Lor's illness.<br/><br/>Kel hidden in the shadows took advantage of this moment to try to stab the man who destroy his family when he took his brother and who he believed to have sent the assassin who killed his mother and father.<br/><br/>Kai returned and came to the help of his master and blocked his brother's attack. He didn't believe that this adversary was his twin, despite the likeness, and they fought star-metal sword against dagger until Kai lost his balance and fell from the platform. Kel caught his arm and tried to help his twin to climb back up.<br/><br/>Lor, wielding his own star-metal sword was beginning to ascertain his will on Setarra, using the oath of servitude, but he hesitated to help his apprentice and Setarra took advantage of that to try to free demons from the crystal. Lor let Kel save Kai and attacked Setarra with a thunderbolt.<br/><br/>Kel after he lifted up his twin, put himself between Setarra and Lor, and with his void magic, he nullified Lor's lightning.<br/><br/>In a flashback, Lor saw Kel for the first time and understood that he was touched by the darkness and his twin by light. Their mother was a lost love of the magister.<br/><br/>Prompted by his master, Kai occupied Kel who convinced him he really was his twin brother. Setarra took a strange form where a human torso and head appeared amid her horrible demon body. The head was Kai and Kel's mother and Setarra tried to use it to hypnotize Magister Lor, but it didn't work and Magister Lor finally bound the demon, who was trapped in the human form of the mother.<br/><br/>His victory didn't last, Kel, always loyal to Setarra, attacked with all his power of void Lor, who fell dead.<br/><br/>In a flashback Magister taught his apprentice Kai that he should not let his emotion control him and ended his lesson by saying that someday he will not be here anymore and Kai should be prepared.<br/><br/>The storm still swept the platform whereas the twins faced each other, their masters dead or paralyzed. Setarra tried to convince Kai she was her mother, but the apprentice gathered his light to reveal the monstrous form of the demon. That helped him to reason his brother, when the ghost of Magister Lor was guided by the light to continue to give advices to his apprentice. Kel understood his errors, the light of Kai pushing back the wrath which inhabited his heart.<br/>[Kel bought off the key of the outcast and took the key of the teamspirit]<br/><br/>But if Magister Lor was a ghost, his last spell could not contain Setarra anymore. The demon, seeing Kel betraying her, decided to destroy the crystal prison to liberate her kind, but Magister Lor used his ghostly energy to create a powerful shield to protect the crystal.<br/>[Setarra bought off the key of servitude and took the key of the bloodlust]<br/><br/>Furious, Setarra wanted to kill, she jumped and dove to attack Kai. Kel took his twin place at the last moment and Setarra tore off his arm.<br/>[Kel bought off the key of demonic oath and took the key of the spotlight]<br/><br/>In a flashback, Kel dreamt of being a pirate king, Setarra on the disguise of his second promised him the control of the terrible leviathans.<br/><br/>Kai had a vision of the futur, he ran a magic academy, helped by his twin and the ghost of Magister Lor came a last time to congratulate his apprentice become master.<br/><br/>Kai, seeing his brother dying, enraged, followed the instruction of Magister Lor and helped by Kel giving his last strength, attacked Setarra and threw her back in the crystal prison. Then he tried to heal his brother, but there was to much blood and worst, a powerful voice thrummed in his head \u201cWho has awaked me ? I want food\u201d and a huge tentacle caught Kai.<br/><br/>Kel took a star-metal sword and the ghost hand of Magister Lor activated the blazing blade. Kel cut the tentacle and the leviathan cried in pain, his violent move pushed the crystal which fell in the lower depths where the leviathan retreated. Kai saved, Kel died in peace.<br/><br/>Days later, his vision not realized, Kai sailed his brother's airship to look for the crystal prison and find an apprentice.<br/><br/>Remark : the player playing Setarra didn't roll very well and so he concluded that's why evil can't win : no luck with the dice.<br/><br/>Now with the same players we plan to play Lord Scurlock.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
