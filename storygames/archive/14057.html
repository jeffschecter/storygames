Artists First competition.  The game used D. Vincent Baker's artwork (the cavepeople line drawings), and was about a society of archaeologist/explorer types that gather with their fellow society members and must present the new cave paintings they've found.  The game features a cave painting drawing element to it.<br/><br/>Does anybody remember the name of this game or its author?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior" title="14thWarrior"><img alt="14thWarrior" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.netflash.net/llanade/BHG_Avatar_Sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior">14thWarrior</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318199/#Comment_318199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T12:40:07+00:00" title="March 30, 2011 12:40PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Google-fu may have failed; but I should have trusted in my Story-Games-fu.  A few searches here at S-G and I've found my answer.  The game I was trying to identify was "The Adventures of Blake Borrow, World-Class Archaeologist" by Bryan Hansel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
