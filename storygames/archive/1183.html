                    Hi all,<br/><br/>I've been following the whole Gencon Forge booth kerfluffle, which seems from the outside to be essentially an issue created by success - the booth becoming so popular that stuff is getting missed or marginalised that may not deserve that fate.<br/><br/>It's an interesting discussion, lots of good points being made.<br/><br/>One bit I'm not following though, is sales.  I see people on the Forge talking about selling 32 games and that not being bad, the target being 40.  Many seem to have sold far less.<br/><br/>However, clearly the one thing people are agreeing on is that saleswise this was a great year.  Stuff sold hand over fist, or anyway that's the description I've universally seen.<br/><br/>How does that reconcile?  Genuine question, I'm struggling to see how on those kinds of sales numbers people are making money, yet clearly it was a financial success.  So, is it a volume of games with each selling few copies but overall that still adds up to a lot of $.  Do some games sell like crazy with the rest just a bit?  What are the numbers?<br/><br/>Please note, none of this is critical, if it reads that way it's my error, nothing more.  But I wasn't there and following from outside there is this odd dichotomy between so much success that it is actually causing a problem and sales figures that look to be honest very small.  I'm missing something, probably something everyone is taking for granted and thus not discussing.<br/><br/>Thanks.                </div>

Yes, production costs may well be one thing I'm missing.<br/><br/>One of the key bits of the Forge, as best I can tell, is about recovering your costs and using that to keep funding your game.  Is part of the success then that some people are selling enough to cover their costs of production and allow them to keep producing their games?                        </div>

                            What about secondary sales?  What I mean is -- do retailers order copies of your game to sell in their stores because they saw you at GenCon?  Or is GenCon more about connecting with friends and selling copies of your game there and then?                        </div>

Yeah, and part of the success for some people is being able to pay a full ride at GenCon (which normally costs a couple hundred bucks).<br/><br/>Where the strain is happening is that some guys sold a lot more, while others sold few or none (particluarly with older/not brand new games). There are many reasons for this, which everyone is trying to explore right now.

                            We (Bully Pulpit Games) have sold enough to pay for subsequent print runs with a one print run buffer (give or take) in the bank, as well as Web hosting, Gen Con flights, badges, and booth fees, and a bunch of silly promotional swag thusfar.  Current profits are being used to build up an art budget for a future project.  So for us, yes, staying in the black counts as success.  We're not feeding our families off the "profits".  <br/><br/>As a side note, we haven't made back our investment on Drowning and Falling yet, so no money has been donated to our charity.  We're about ten sales shy of breaking even on that.                        </div>

I understand the kerfluffle, it's actually a common small business phenomenon.<br/><br/>Relatives of mine had a factory in Ireland making raincoats, a small factory, as this was a family business.  They did ok, got some reputation, sales improved.<br/><br/>Then they got a commission from the Swedish army, it nearly drove them out of business.  The rapid expansion was way beyond anything their systems were set up to handle, logistically or in terms of supporting existing clients while meeting the new one's needs.<br/><br/>It's a common story, a business does well, passes a critical threshold, orders flood in and quite often at that point it goes bust trying to cope with the increased volume.  Going bust I don't see as an issue here, this isn't quite that kind of organisation, but the problem looks very familiar.                        </div>

<p>Balbinus,</p>
<p>People overestimate what good numbers are for an RPG. If you sold over 20 copies of your game at GenCon, you did alright. If you sold over 35, you did really well. If you sold over 50, then I'm amazed. I sold, as I remember, 40 copies of my brand-new game, and 15 copies of The Shadow of Yesterday, and I was really happy with those numbers.</p>
<p>People have a limited amount of money and time for RPGs, so sales aren't going to be in the 60-200 range anytime soon. What does occur, though, is a remarkable jump in sales after a convention. My post-GenCon sales have been outrageous.</p>

                            Similar to Jason's words, a lot of designers do this as a hobby, so covering costs is what counts as a financial success. And sometimes it's not all the costs. When I went to ComicCon, I only made back my table cost and the price for my helper-person to stay in the hotel, and called it a win.  This may not be sound accounting, but it keeps the Company happy.<br/>
<br/>
What's been hammered into my head over the past three years is that hardly anybody makes money in this sector of the game industry. There are a few notable exceptions, but for the most part, game design is a hobby business.                        </div>

And that's the thing I'm missing that people take for granted so don't say.<br/><br/>The figures are surprising, games that get huge attention online like DitV have sold I think around 3,000 copies, which does not seem that many but for an indie game sold largely on word of mouth actually is not so bad at all.<br/><br/>I don't recall seeing much by way of figures for the non-indie sector (wherever one draws that line that is), which makes it hard to get an overall feel for how fits into the broader market (excluding DnD, if you include DnD I know perfectly well how it fits into the broader market but that distorts the analysis too much to be useful).                        </div>

                            I sold 50 copies of Don't Rest Your Head, out of a total stock (held at IPR) of about 90.  Each of them cost about $7 to make, if you factor in shipping costs and art acquisition, yadda yadda.  The GenCon sales alone paid for the entirety of my first print run and the project as a whole -- and I'd already sold about 200 copies prior to GenCon over the course of a month and a half.  Consider that in my wildest dreams I never expected to sell more than 50... total.  Ever.  And that, once I had hit that mark, I'd already paid for all the costs of the project.<br/><br/>The numbers that people are quoting are accurate, as is their evaluation that those numbers mean a good sales year.  Step back a bit and look at the numbers for the whole booth: the booth grossed somewhere north of $32,000 in sales.  That's huge.<br/><br/>My general observations on the state of small press RPG sales tend to suggest that...<br/><br/>40+ sales of a well-priced book probably means that most of the initial costs got covered.<br/><br/>100+ sales means that the game is a good-sized success!<br/><br/>250+ sales means that you're a wild success.  (Or at least, having hit a total of about 260-270 sales on Don't Rest Your Head, I feel pretty confident calling this a wild success given the ratio of cash outlay to money taken in.)<br/><br/>1000+ sales means that you're Luke Crane or Vincent Baker, or another member of a relatively small list.<br/><br/>The market is *small*, man.                        </div>

                            I sold 26 copies of carry and 10 of Timestream. After factoring in booth buy-in, travel, food and hotel for Gen Con and back, I ended up about 75 bucks in the red. And thats because I paid 200 dollars more for my return ticket because I went on a week vacation. So, in that light, I ended up about 125 bucks ahead.<br/><br/>Alternately, I paid for my print run of carry and defrayed some cost of Con-going.<br/><br/>To me, this is success.                        </div>

                            Fred,<br/><br/>Thanks for that.  That is golden actually, great info.<br/><br/>Kind of depressing though.  PTA, IMO one of the best games to come out of the whole indie scene, the thought that might have sold 1000 copies or fewer is just dispiriting.  To me it looks like a breakthrough game, one that could potentially be huge, but clearly that isn't yet happening.<br/><br/>Which doesn't mean it won't.  Right now some guy might be about to post in Actual Play on the Forge or on rpg.net some game that will change everything, but given the creativity and skill going into stuff it's surprising how small the market is.<br/><br/>Some of it I suspect is focus, I genuinely don't think that many people want to buy focussed games, but that can't be all of it.  I wonder if it's partly a critical mass issue, if so then we would expect the market initially to be small and then potentially quite quickly change.<br/><br/>Year ago Ron Edwards made some predictions about how the indie gaming scene would go and how sales would develop, my impression is that they were good predictions.  Anyone know where to find them and if they're still online at all?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R. Nixon</cite>You did make the game because it's a pure expression of your own goals and ideals, right?</blockquote>
That in a nutshell is why I check out indie games.<br/><br/>When I started gaming every game was somebody's vision, somebody's stab at creating the perfect game for them.  Now, that's not always true.  Many to be honest have a certain committee feel.<br/><br/>The indie games, they have that old school feel.  I don't like all of them, but it is a necessary consequence of haing a unique idea for a game that many people will not like it.  That is not a bad thing, it means the game has enough character to be worth not liking.<br/><br/>I know old school might seem an odd term to apply, but in many ways the indie scene has more in common with (original) Runequest, Tunnels and Trolls, Traveller, En Garde and those other early games than it does with the Werewolf:  The Apocalpyses and Slaine d20s.                        </div>

I'm not saying it to talk about financial wizardry, and I'm DEFINITELY not looking to suggest that the market isn't viable.  What I *am* saying is that in terms of what to *expect*, 100 copies is a Big Deal, is a Measure of Success, and Should Be Seen As A Respectably Large Quantity.                        </div>

                            hmmm, this is all very interesting stuff, I think alot of people have different goals though. <br/>
<br/>
For one, I dont think anyone is realistically thinking they are going to feed themselves on this stuff. (at least not more than the occasional cheap pizza for gaming night). I mean what are people typically making on profit per book? A coupla bucks per unit is the perception I have. Even at 3000 copies sold, thats not enough to live on. Eventually, some are bound to get lucky and get rich off this. But I dont know that that is a realistic goal to set for yourself, instead I like to think, "I got my game out there" is a perfectly valid and respectable goal. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I dont think everyone (although some certainly are) is even doing this for the money in the first place, many just honestly enjoy making a game and then enjoy the knowledge that there are actually people out there playing there games. I definitely dont think anything should be done to discourage these types, it might have some vague subtle negative effect on the "market" but who cares? Its also where alot of the gems come from. Art for Art's sake and all that. Not that I think there is really any effective way to discourage them anyways. These are the kinda people who work there butts off to make and publish a game, for the sole reward of being able to say they published a game. More power to them. <br/>
<br/>
Now, for the ones that are in this to make money, good for you to. If it wasnt for you, there likely wouldnt be an RPG market, much less an indie market. <br/>
<br/>
I dont think of selling a 1000 copies as dispiriting at all, thats potentially a 1000 groups playing a game you made up. Thats awesome, and for me at least, that would be the goal I would shoot for. People actually playing my games. The money would be nice, and if it came to me, I surely wouldnt turn it down, but in the meantime, im gonna keep my dayjob. (not that I am a published game designer, or anywhere near, just saying "if"). <br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, I think all this discussion of how to expand the "market" is good for us to have. I just dont like the idea of everyong getting all focused on the financial end of it, thats the gravy in my opinion. The meat is real people playing your game. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>

Well, in my case, a little more than a coupla -- I'm making about $6-7 per copy of DRYH that gets sold (regardless of it selling for $8 PDF or $15 print, they both yield about the same, due to small volume print on demand being my production method).  If it gets into the whole distribution system somehow (some retailers do buy from IPR), then I'll be making only a couple bucks on a sale -- but that's sort of advertising cost, considering that that would mean the product has a shot at showing up on some game store book shelves, giving some increased visibility -- because retailers tend to buy product from distributors at somewhere around 40-60% of the cover price.  Indie folk tend to make more of their sales directly to the consumer (or through a "lightweight" fulfiller like IPR making sales directly to the consumer).  This may mean lower sales volume, but it *does* mean that the money made per sale is larger than it would be "traditionally".  And that means that a smaller number of sales still yields up enough to cover the break-even costs -- which is a decent benchmark for sustainability.  Looking ahead to Spirit of the Century, I think we're going to make a fair chunk more than the per-book print costs on any direct-to-consumer sale, and that's exactly as designed.  All Evil Hat *really* needs to happen with any product is to have it sell enough to cover the costs of pre-printing and anything we didn't do ourselves in-house (which usually means "the art budget", but sometimes means a few other things, like "$15 to license a font" or "several hundred dollars to get Genevieve Cogman to write a section of the Dresden Files RPG for us").<br/><br/>(And again, I'm not trying to hurl around the financial-wizardry-speak here; I'm trying to offer a specific, factual, numerical perspective on my own experience with selling my first commercial game ever over the last two months.)                        </div>

                            A kind of off-topic but important note for game publishers/sellers that I thought I'd drop in since the issue is cropping up. <br/><br/>Creative and ideals-related goals aside, if you are at least willing to state that you are publishing your game to make money, then a whole new world of business-related tax deductions opens up to you so long as the IRS believes you (or doesn't audit you). You can even take these deductions (and offset them against your other income) if it turns out that your game publishing business produced a loss for the year. But as soon as you say that your publishing is a hobby or that you don't care about making money, then you have effectively cut off all possibility of taking deductions for your game publishing-related expenses to the extent they exceed the money you make on sales. That's damn important. So watch what you say out here on the Internet because you never know who's going to see it.<br/><br/>Note: Of course, this is a simplification of the business / hobby divide, and I'm not offering anyone legal advice here or telling you how to handle your business expenses. Go see an your accountant, your lawyer, or Turbo tax for that.                        </div>

                            My personal experience is that it's a continuum between "Art for Art's sake" and "Making money off of this." It is totally not an either/or. I mean, I started writing games with the intent to just release them for free on the internet. And that I learned how stupid easy it is to sell your game, and I made the concious decision to get my shit together and make some money off of the thing I love. My first benchmark is to totally pay for all of my expenses that have gone towards game design, including a couple years of web hosting and some advertising expenses before I decided to charge for my games. Things are well on their way to that goal, and I am happy, BOTH with my creative/artistic product AND with my income off of it.<br/><br/>And yes, it is a freelance publishing business, in my book. I'm a professional freelancer anyway, so  it all goes under my expenses as in independent contractor.                        </div>

                            Nathan,<br/><br/>Unfortunately, to the IRS it is either a profit-oriented business or a hobby, black or white. You've got it a bit easier, tax-wise, since you're already in business for yourself in a related area. For those of us with a day job with an employer that has nothing to do with game publishing, it's a very different situation and care must be taken to treat the enterprise in a business-like manner if you want it respected for tax purposes. <br/><br/>That said, of course you make games because you like doing it, too, and want others to see and enjoy your work. I'm just trying to encourage everyone to be careful how they characterize their efforts in a public forum. <br/><br/>Sorry about the thread derailing.                        </div>

                            To stay on topic: In my experience at the Forge booth, games that are well-promoted (at the con) can and will sell about 30 copies for the show. Games that are break out hits will sell 50-70. And there are games that constantly push that limit. Last year, The Mountain Witch sold 90 something copies, Polaris sold 80 something. The year before that, My Life with Master sold 70 odd copies. This year 1001 Nights sold 80 something copies and Burning Empires crested the century mark 102. <br/>
<br/>
These are the exceptions. Games that are not the new cool sell, as I said, about 30 copies. Games that are underpromoted or having an off con, sell 20ish copies. Having seen the numbers for four Forge booths now, I'm pretty firm on that. <br/>
<br/>
The Kerfuffle seems to be about how to maximize our presence and energy at the booth to make sure that no games have a bad year or get underpromoted. Given the stakes -- fame, fortune and all that -- it's understandable that it's a rather heated discussion.<br/>
<br/>
And to drift off topic: In the grand scheme of things for our games, Gencon sales are a blip. A nice blip, but a blip nonetheless. Our games don't sell thousands of copies, they sell hundreds. A break out hit like Fred's game will probably sell a thousand copies in its life. That's a wild success.<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue what the numbers are for Green Ronin or Mongoose and I'd love to know. I suspect that they sell in the thousands on average over the lifespan of a title. Their break out hits probably sell in the tens of thousands. These companies are better tied to the gamer market -- their DnD stuff gives them an in that we don't have. They also advertise and have a big slot in the distro catalogs and a fist full of awards to dangle at the skeptics. But they also operate under a very different model than we do.<br/>

<blockquote>I suspect that they sell in the thousands on average over the lifespan of a title.</blockquote>
I recall someone on the inside saying that the bigger companies tend to sell the bulk of any given product in the first 90 days.<br/><br/>That's certainly not the case with me.<br/><br/>Oh, and...
<blockquote>look for PTA's numbers to go up now that it's going to be available in retail stores.</blockquote>
Just FYI: a far bigger boost in my sales was making a PDF available for sale. Going through retail has given me a 5-10 percent boost so far, at least initially, but PDFs much more than that.<br/><br/>Back on topic, sales at Gen Con, as Clinton has said elsewhere, are not the real reason to go. The real reason is to watch ATHF late at night on Luke's laptop.                        </div>

Well, these days a lot of publishers are repping multiple titles. So from lumpley, for instance, you would have Dogs in the Vineyard and Mechaton and kpfs. 50 games doesn't necessarily mean 50 publishers.                        </div>

                            I didn't get to get in at the Forge booth this year (I was at the Key20 booth with Jerry Grayson instead) but I had pretty good sales with Panty Explosion. I sold enough over the show to pay for the cost of the initial 150 copy print run. i would have been happy to sell a third of that.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about being a small publisher like this is that when you sell 5 or 10 games its actually a big deal. We charge $20 for a copy of Panty Explosion, and take about $17 of that in profit. Thats not bad. Of course we make far less money on sales through distributors or to stores, but face to face or website sales are really nice for us. I imagine its the same for most small publishers.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we never created Panty Explosion with the idea that we could make a living off it. The actual goal is to make enough money to afford a pair of Playstation 3's at launch. So far so good. And bringing in a few hundred bucks at Gencon or another show is certainly nie. i'm a freelance illustratot and matts a Student and father. neither of us ever have any money, and an extra $200 each actually  is a big deal for us.<br/>
<br/>
See, even poor people can publish. POD is really amazing.<br/>

                            What is the purpose of GenCon to game sellers? I put it to you that the Forge booth may have made more money than WotC when all expenses are taken into account, given that WotC probably doesn't even plan on making money at the convention. I know that there have been years where they certainly have not. Oh, with Pokemon sales and such, they probably do make money. But if you look at it in terms of the RPG sales alone? I'm almost certain that they write off GenCon as an advertising expense. <br/><br/>The purpose of any convention for a seller is not to sell product but to get it known. In the RPG "market" selling your game to 20 people in the course of four days is a huge spike that will result in lots more sales going on down the line. <br/><br/>So, OK, let's say that you are only ever going to sell 1000 copies of your game, over the course of 5 years or so. 200 copies a year, or averaging less than a copy per day. Well, then GenCon does, in fact, represent a sales spike, and a profitable one as well. But let's put that aside for a second, and admit that you're not going to sell 1000 copies if you don't go to GenCon and sell those 20 copies there. <br/><br/>Is the overall plan which includes selling a total of 1000 copies a success? Well, let's say that the average product earns 5$ a copy sold after expenses for the full run. That's pretty conservative, most will profit more per unit unless they end up in heavy distribution to get to the 1000 mark. <br/><br/>That's a profit of $5000 for your work, averaging $1000 a year. <br/><br/>That's a lot of pizza. <br/><br/>No, nobody is quitting their day job to do this. Not one person who started down this road thought that they might do so. Not even Luke, the champeen seller this year. But they do want to not just sell games, but make enough money to, say, justify their hobby expenditures a bit more. <br/><br/>The "huge success" of the Forge booth is not that any one person succeeded at this. But that most of the 43 people involved in selling succeeded at this. Even if percentages were lower in terms of success this year (and I'm not convinced that's true, either), more people were successes this year at the Forge booth than ever before. <br/><br/>I have more below, but have to cut in two because of the forum limits...<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Let's put this all in perspective. There have been RPG game companies before where there have been full time employees. Now, many of them have actually been worse jobs than my day job, shipping, for instance. So we really don't want to include those in any comparison. The real comparison is how many people have actually been game designers full time. <br/><br/>More importantly, of those people, how many are still full time game designers or have had this as a stable job description. Kevin Sembieda (who is now asking fans for a bailout due to apparent embezzlement)? Steve Jackson? Note that Steve hires people as freelancers for design, he doesn't hire designers full time (I don't even think that Dr. Kromm is full time). And when was the last time he had time to design an actual RPG? That would be GURPS...<br/><br/>The Nephews? Well, actually I don't think that they design...they just move games, like Steve Jackson's games. Really just a business like any other. Robin Laws? What company does he work for? Hmmm. Matt Forebeck? Makes his money on Comics and other writing assignments. <br/><br/>Did you catch that? Little known novelist makes more money than RPG designer makes. <br/><br/>Gary Gygax? He's been a freelancer for decades now. The Iron Crown Empires gang? Went bankrupt after their ownership of the Middle Earth lisence meant that their CCG couldn't continue to be produced - the RPG was already long unprofitable so the CCG death was just the nail in the coffin. FASA? With the goddamn battletech property? Nope, couldn't keep them afloat. When they were up, it was almost all based on the board/minis game anyhow, not their RPG entries like Mechwarrior. GDW? Despite having Traveller, and some of the best minds in gaming, they couldn't stay afloat. <br/><br/>Let's see, so we've got the "Big Names" like WotC, WizKids, and Games Workshop (not to forget your side of the pond, Max). Well, all of these are afloat on Miniatures or CCG sales. Yeah, Games Workshop has a RPG. Does it make money? I'll bet not. Oh, they'll make a mint on Warhammer Online, sure. Wanna bet whether they got that going based on Warhammer Minis sales, or based on WHFRP? <br/><br/>In any case the owners of D&amp;D, which represents half or more of this "market" have gone bankrupt. More than once. White Wolf? Dumped by WotC when they owned it. One guess as to why they dumped the number two gaming line. <br/><br/>The problem is that no RPG line can continue to be profitable indefinitely. D&amp;D does make money, sure, when it releases a new edition of it's core books. And then only. And then the "line" bleeds red for several years until they come up with the next edition. There have been, what? 8 major editions of D&amp;D now? You think that they're not aware that this is the only time they make money? And they do it by, basically, selling to all the same people again and again. <br/><br/>So, to put it simply, the idea of being a "Full Time RPG Designer" is a pipe dream. I mean, let's say that you design some really innovative game that, in fact, does like Magic: The Gathering did for WotC, and opens up gaming to a whole huge new crowd of people. Sells millions. Gets you rich. What will you do then? Will you call it your day job, and just keep selling the same game? RPG here, not CCG. Let's see, that's what Gygax did, and he went bankrupt. The man was a millionaire, and he lost it all, because he thought that there was such a thing as being a "Full Time RPG Designer." <br/><br/>Ain't no such thing. What does a smart fellow do, when he sees that these sorts of bonanzas are one-time phenomena? He sells WotC to Hasbro, and makes GenCon his sole business. Then Hasbro subsequently cuts the staff down to a fraction of it's previous size. <br/><br/>So...if one can be a game designer, and make money at it, come out in the black? Well, then one has done about as well as one can do in this "market." <br/><br/>Is all of this somehow depressing? Yeah, it's depressing that it took people more than two decades of failure to realize these facts. If, however, you understand what RPGs are all about, the size of the community, how they sell to a limited group and are then done forever, for practical purposes. If you do that, you can make being an RPG designer an interesting and profitable sideline. <br/><br/>That sounds like success to me. <br/><br/>Put another way, why should one game, The RPG, support more people than Monopoly does? Given that Monopoly outsells all RPGs put together every year. Expecting RPGs to do this is just not realistic. The error wasn't Gygax's pretending it could be done. The error was everyone else thinking they could reproduce what he'd done, and failing to notice him go bankrupt. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            One last thing following up on the above two posts. Want to continue to be successful? Then its definitely not about the money.
