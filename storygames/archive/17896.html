More specifically, I have enjoyed enormously all the compendium classes that I have read, from the backer's .pdf of them, to the ones found on the Something Awful forums, to wherever else they may crop up. They seem so wonderfully evocative, so descriptive and interesting, and great at helping to define and refine characters in interesting, oftentimes unique, ways. <br/><br/>But! I have a hard time keeping in my head all the different options. At any given moment, instead of saying, "Oh yeah, there's an awesome compendium class that suggests a fictional element that could be relevant here!", I'm more likely to just make something up from thin air. That's not a bad thing, I know, and I can also always just make up a new compendium class for the element we do wind up using. But I love those compendium classes every time I read them over, and I'd love to include them more prominently. Some are easy for me ("Bearer" is stuck in my brain like a fly in amber because I loves me some intelligent weapons), but others will slip my mind when I don't have them in front of me. And there are a lot of options to keep in front of me. They all have different conditions to fulfill for them to come up, yes, but if I'm not thinking about them and those prerequisite conditions, there's a fair chance that some of them will never occur in the fiction. For example, the Blob compendium class involves someone becoming part slime or ooze. If I'm not thinking about that class, though, or if I don't have some kind of reminder, then I might not think about that option. (The Blob is a poor example, because it too is lodged in my brain, but hopefully it conveys the idea.) <br/><br/>So here's my notion, then, to try and get some of these awesome compendium classes more explicitly involved. At the beginning of play, when everybody makes characters, everybody goes through whatever resources we have and picks a compendium class. This doesn't mean they get that class's move or anything! It just means that each player gets to send up a flag that, "Yes, please, I'd like to see this, that'd be cool." We still play to find out, we still play to see if anyone ever gets to fulfill that class's base condition, but now I have in front of me several compendium classes that have been specifically pointed out as interesting, and I'm going to keep those in mind when I'm thinking about the world. If somebody points out "Bearer," then I know to be thinking about intelligent weapons. If somebody points out "Blob," then I know to be thinking about oozes and slimes. If somebody points out "Wraithlander," then I know to be thinking about (or asking about) the Wraithlands, how to get there, how to get back, how important they are. These ideas can become part of the fiction, in a way that they might not if I wasn't thinking of them. <br/><br/>So what do you think? I'm wary of the problem of not playing to find out, but then again, I really like the idea of these flags, and of having these compendium classes be existent, identified elements of our fictional world.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404946/#Comment_404946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-29T10:45:35+00:00" title="January 29, 2013 10:45AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like great story game GMing to me Brendan.

I really love your idea. Everybody gets an XP if the Compendium Class gets used. That's awesome, and would do a great job to further encourage an interest in those CCs as fictional elements. I'm tempted to suggest that it should also include something about using another player's chosen CC. "If you take the Compendium Class move for a Compendium Class chosen at the start of the campaign, everybody gets 1 xp. If you take the Compendium Class move for a Compendium Class chosen by another player, but not by you, at the start of the campaign, everybody gets an additional 1 xp (2 total)." That might not be a good idea, and might be overstepping boundaries, but I've always loved it when one player reincorporates something another player introduces, and this seems a good way to encourage that reincorporation. Need to think on it. <br/><br/><b>Deliverator:</b><br/><br/>Yeah, I like that way to think about it. It's a bit complicated by the nature of Compendium Classes, though. Some Compendium Classes really do imply the strong fictional elements. "This CC implies that yes, you can become one with the slime." "This CC implies that yes, there are intelligent weapons out there." "This CC implies that yes, you can gain power by eating the heart of a dragon." <br/><br/>Others, though, are more just codifications of things you've done. "Started a guild? Yup, that's a Compendium Class. Become a noblewoman with land of her own? That's a Compendium Class, too. Incited the people to revolt against the gentry? COMPENDIUM CLASS FOR YOU."<br/><br/>Maybe, for my start of campaign idea, I need to split them up like that? The ones that are very focused on adding elements to the fiction are the ones they should choose from at the beginning, while the ones that are more about things that you might do that should be available as options pretty much no matter what are just all left out there? <br/><br/>If somebody had chosen, say, the Guild Leader Compendium Class at the beginning of play, then my response would've been to think about how to make Guilds matter, how to enable the creation of a guild, and so on. So it would affect how I'm thinking about the fiction. But simultaneously, a PC might just say, "Y'know, I'm a badass thief with boat loads of coin. I want to start a Thieves' Guild." And I could see that happening in nearly any game. Whereas if I'm not thinking about the Compendium Class for becoming the cursed wielder of Nightfang (read: Stormbringer), then it might not occur to me to bring that into play. <br/><br/>Hmmm. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Maybe I'm overthinking it, and I should just cool my jets, let it flow from play. Follow the principles. All the good old adages. <br/><br/><b>UserClone:</b><br/><br/>Love the Blob! It's just such a great example of the delicious, beautiful, magical weirdness that I crave in DW.

I'm having a hard time getting a strong read or suggestions around compendium classes. Is my concept and idea roughly what you are doing:<br/><br/>I want to setup a con game which isn't just a "let's play DW" game, but more of a rough situation... the PCs are part of a band of "Monster Specialists" who work for a patreon, and they're being sent on a mission. I have a rough idea of the mission, but wanted the characters, their relationship to the patreon and each other, and the actual world and map and such to be DW-fluid.<br/><br/>My idea was to have each player choose a class, but also a "role" or "desciptor" (compendium class?) in relation to the story or group. For example: The Rookie, The Monk, The Rebel, The Protected, The Monster Specialist, etc. Each one of those would have one move associated with it, and a list of thematic / related questions that help inform how the PCs are related to the situation.<br/><br/>As an example, The Monk is described with "<i>You are of an old order: The Keepers of the Histories. Too bad the Holy Church of Purification burned all the books. And all the monks.</i>". <br/><br/>This means the monk can really be of any class, but still belongs to some old order. In addition, they'd answer questions such as "How were you able to escape when the Holy Church of Purification came and razed your monastery to the ground?", and "What have you heard of the ancient people known as the spirit walkers?" This helps inform the scenario in some ways. They also get a free move of "When you <i>need to know something of the past</i>, roll +1 ..." In this case I wanted each PC to be specialized in a thing, but I didn't necessarily want it to be stat based (e.g. here with Wisdom or Intelligence) because then it might limit the class combinations people would be comfortable in choosing.<br/><br/>Thoughts? There is a part of me that wants to ask "Am I doing it right?" (even though F that, it sounds right to me).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
