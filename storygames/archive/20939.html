The point is precisely in choosing (in the most vague terms) which of two opportunities of plot development to go for, not to evaluate a character's performance. As for the endings, they are what they are: <i>consequence</i> - though it's especially interesting, in dramatic terms, that <i>Fiasco</i> sometimes (but not often) allows for excessively tragic or undeservedly mild consequences to befall a character in the end. That's a form of dramatic irony that I quite appreciate, and I most appreciate that it's wholly out of my control and occasionally anticlimatic even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459498/#Comment_459498" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-22T17:44:07+00:00" title="January 22, 2017  5:44PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2017 5:44PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Rafu says, there's no discussion of success or failure in Fiasco.

This always perplexes me because I have always found it to work so well to produce the outcomes it is designed for. One think to realize is that something that is good  from the perspective of an ambitious person with poor judgment and impulse control, can seriously reek havoc in their lives, and the lives of others, and cause destruction in the larger context of the story. The suggestions, at the beginning of act one and act two are very important as well, they are as follows:<br/>Act one: <br/>"In the first act, we should meet our guys and see the dynamics of their Relationships in action. Everything you do should foreshadow things to come. If we meet an overbearing father, he\u2019s going to get a hell of a lot more overbearing later \u2212 and rebelled against. If we see a machete, it\u2019s going to hack some stuff to pieces later in the game. Use this time to set things up and begin to knock them down."<br/>Act two:<br/>"Act Two is where the wheels should start to come off. Things are going wrong. New problems have emerged. Fires \u2212 met- aphorical and maybe literal \u2212 will need to be fought. This is where you unscrew the jar of crazy and throw the lid at some- one."<br/>I think if you understand all this, it would be very hard for Fiasco to not accomplish what it is designed for. For anyone who has had trouble running the game, follow these principles and tried again and I'm sure the results will be terrific <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_459503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459503/#Comment_459503" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-22T22:45:10+00:00" title="January 22, 2017 10:45PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Can you tell us more about what your mean by (finding a success/failure) "meaningful"?</blockquote>\nWhere <i>your</i> character achieving their personal objectives is irrelevant to achieving the intent of play.\n<blockquote>If I get you right, you prefer games where you're inside the character looking out rather than outside the character looking in.</blockquote>\nNo. Either is fine. <br/><br/>It's a matter of having <i>a basis for decision</i>.

Normally it is pretty obvious. Sometimes an outcome could be either, but at your table it is definitely positive and at my table it is definitely negative, based on our consensus about what is interesting and fun. There's no formal criteria, because I want you to make the choices that are perfect for you and your friends, and you are, collectively, really good at determining those. <br/><br/>As a side note, when playing with strangers it can take a while to gel, and in these cases I tend to facilitate strongly and model <i>my </i>culture of play and expectations, which seems to work fine. <br/><br/>And AnonAdderlan, you should try your no-dice-random-suggestions-from-an-audience method, my guess is that you are mistaken but we won't know until you try. I put a lot of thought and care into <i>Fiasco</i>, and the pieces that are conspicuously absent are as deliberate as the pieces that are rigorously codified.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459511/#Comment_459511" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T05:40:37+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  5:40AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first Fiasco game left me cold, but we were all learning how to play and how it was different. After that, it's varied. It's never sucked, but sometimes, it's merely okay, and sometimes, it's rocked the house down. I'm trying to figure out how the okay games differed from the ones that rocked, as it's not like we had any trouble figuring out the rules.<br/><br/>I know when I see folks who've rarely or never played and they get enthused, the whole table catches metaphorical fire. But, I've also been in groups where we're all old hands and things have been great, so it isn't directly linked to experience, as far as I can tell. I'm guessing the group has to come the headspace you want for PTA, where everyone is enthusiastic and wishes they could buy a ticket to that movie, but this is rather tautological, saying that if folks are invested, they're invested.<br/><br/>As for Fate, I think two things are required. First, you have to understand where the game is coming from, something easier now than in Fate's first incarnation. Second, that has to be the space you want to game in. If it isn't, no harm, no foul, and there are plenty of other games you will like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459517/#Comment_459517" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T11:16:42+00:00" title="January 23, 2017 11:16AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2017 11:19AM by Rafu.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>This requires <b>making decisions based on what you want to see <i>happen</i> to a character rather than what you want to see them <i>accomplish</i>,</b> which is a perspective I find <i>extremely</i> dissonant when playing just a single character.</blockquote>\nThis is pretty much how all Story Games work...all this means is that you like RPGs more than you like Story Games.

Many (most?) of the designs coming out of the Forge were designed to work this way.<br/><br/>To be fair, I see less of this kind of design in the public view these days. (Is it possible, Jeff, that you haven't played any? From what I know of you, it's entirely possible, but of course I'm only guessing.)<br/><br/>As Rafu says, there are many instances in the moment-to-moment of play where a player will be called on to make a call from one perspective or the other, and this can shift back and forth.

(Some might even call it "not roleplaying".) <br/><br/>Can you come up with a concrete example of how that kind of relationship with your character makes "mechanics not matter"? That might help illuminate your point.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">@Jason_Morningstar</a>,<br/><br/>The bit you wrote about "facilitating strongly and modeling your culture of play" sounds like it's fairly key to troubleshooting Fiasco.

Many (most?) of the designs coming out of the Forge were designed to work this way.<br/><br/>To be fair, I see less of this kind of design in the public view these days. (Is it possible, Jeff, that you haven't played any? From what I know of you, it's entirely possible, but of course I'm only guessing.)<br/><br/>As Rafu says, there are many instances in the moment-to-moment of play where a player will be called on to make a call from one perspective or the other, and this can shift back and forth. This happens a LOT in Vincent Baker's game, for a popular example.</blockquote>\nYes, are you and Rafu maybe talking about a game like Lady Blackbird or other games where you both have input into authoring the story AND advocating for a character from a characters POV?

And while this issue is related to 'Immersion', I avoided that term because of the politics and ambiguity associated with it. In general the terms we use in this field (such as 'Story Now', 'Impossible Thing Before Breakfast', 'Fail Forward', 'Murderhobo', and Rollplay vs Roleplay' ) regrettably tend to be a bit to clever for their own good and better at obfuscating issues and building ideologies that providing design insights. <br/><br/>It almost seems like any technical discussion on tabletop RPG design inevitably requires considering politics <i>first</i>.\n<blockquote>when playing with strangers it can take a while to gel, and in these cases I tend to facilitate strongly and model <i>my </i>culture of play and expectations, which seems to work fine.</blockquote>\nBut advocating for your 'culture of play' is sorta what the dice in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Fiasco&amp;Mode=like">#Fiasco</a> do, don't they? It's a communication medium which enables people to <i>express</i> their preferences without <i>demanding</i> specific results.\n<blockquote>you should try your no-dice-random-suggestions-from-an-audience method, my guess is that you are mistaken but we won't know until you try.</blockquote>\nWell if we're assuming these suggestions would be made <i>outside the context of the playbook</i>, then yes, of course it wouldn't. But I could easily see some sort of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Twitch&amp;Mode=like">#Twitch</a> stream where subscribers join Team [character] and advocate for specific outcomes.\n<blockquote>My first Fiasco game left me cold, but we were all learning how to play and how it was different. After that, it's varied. It's never sucked, but sometimes, it's merely okay, and sometimes, it's rocked the house down. I'm trying to figure out how the okay games differed from the ones that rocked, as it's not like we had any trouble figuring out the rules.</blockquote>\nCan a game design be said to work <i>if it doesn't generate consistent results</i>, and if so by what criteria are we using to determine that? At what point can you determine if the players were simply not playing it right, and can you even address that without making it a political fiasco?\n<blockquote>"in a story game you have direct input into what the story is about" - Ben</blockquote>\nThis is why I don't have the same problem in Paranoia, where I prioritize situation over self-interest because you can't win anyway, and reversing the two would lead to boring and stagnant play.\n<blockquote>However, it also seems to me that, if you take this position, you must view what a GM does in a roleplaying game is being... something rather different. (Some might even call it "not roleplaying".)</blockquote>\nYes, in that achieving my NPCs interests <i>is not a priority</i>.<br/><br/>Why would it be? As the GM I can simply declare they do so, which isn't fun for reasons the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Czege" rel="nofollow">Czege Principle</a> points out. And you'll get insufferable Mary Sues if you advocate for your NPCs over your PCs, which is still common enough <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GMPC" rel="nofollow">to be a trope</a>.<br/><br/>NPC are there to create engaging situations <i>for the players</i>.
