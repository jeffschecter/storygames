I realized that I'm out of sync with this community when it comes to 4E. It feels to me that most people here have been into Story Games for long enough that going back to D&amp;D is an interesting experience; they're ready to try it again. I played a ton of D&amp;D and d20 games from 2000 until last August when I discovered Story Games. I've only been playing SGs for less than a year - I'm not ready to go back!<br/><br/>I'm not upset about 4E or railing against it or anything, just feel like I'm not ready and everyone else is excited for it. If it had come out a couple years from now, I'd probably be excited too. <br/><br/>Anyone else feel like that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148785/#Comment_148785" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T21:38:00+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  9:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I feel the same.

The failed midwife found a new and fulfilling career as the spymaster's poisonmaster.  It was a lot of treacherous fun.<br/><br/>The D&amp;Ders had fun too.

After fighting for more than 10 years with a gaming group that contained too many people who only wanted to play AD&amp;D (I could play other games, but only if I GMed them, and with some players that almost every evening asked to return to D&amp;D, no matter if the other players enjoyed the game and asked them to stop and let us play. The other GMs in the group wanted to play other games, too but they always buckle under pressure and always played D&amp;D at the end, so I was the only one who did it and I could play other games as a player only at conventions). At the end I did break the group (and some friendship in the bargain), took the best players (only the girls basically) in another group, to play indie games, and I think you can guess how much I would be interested in playing D&amp;D now (I can give you an hint: when we formed my current gaming group, it was with a precise condition, to which everyone had to agree or not join: "we will never play D&amp;D in this group").<br/><br/>So yes, you can say that I have "issues" with D&amp;D. But it's not only that: I really can't see, even after all the description I have read of the "betterment" built in this edition, what of value this game can give that games like The Burning Wheel, TSOY, Red Box Hack, IAWA, Sorcerer&amp;Sword, Reign, The Riddle of Steel don't already give. It's not stuck fifteen years in the past like the 3rd edition? It's only 3 years in the past? Big deal...<br/><br/>But I really don't like butting in the threads where other people give free reign to their enthusiasm. It was done too many time to me and I don't really think is good form. I didn't post in these threads (apart from the one about rule zero, that was rather generic), and in any case, not having read the books myself I could not have said nothing more than "I am not interested, thanks" (and I am really too fed up with people who talk about indie games without having ever played one to begin to act like them)<br/><br/>So why I am posting this now? Because in this case it's not to rain on other people's parade, but it's to say a "you're not alone" to Scott.<br/><br/>And for asking, to everybody who think they can do it, an objective (or nearly enough) review (or comment) of D&amp;D 4th edition, without all the emotional baggage that goes around the "old game of my youth" or the "game of the evil corporation", and without any consideration about "what it can meant for the hobby"<br/><br/>An objective valuation about the objective value of this game, as if it was published with another name, from another company, in a world where D&amp;D didn't exist and the strongest sellers are Donjon, Burning Wheel, Reign and TsOY.<br/><br/>(yes, a imaginary objective valutation. Aren't they all imaginary, after all?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148792/#Comment_148792" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T00:22:59+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 12:22AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite>Both can co-exist in harmony, they don't need to knife fight in a phone booth.</blockquote>\nWhich is ironic, since I had a bagful of D&amp;D tiles under my chair while Ubal-Noo was busy being stabbed in the eye by her half-brother, the prince Rab Syn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148797/#Comment_148797" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T04:00:23+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  4:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>I feel like I felt at an indie convention when someone suggested playing old-school D&amp;D.

Many tropes were usurped and distorted.<br/><br/>I played 4e on Friday night. It seems, from my limited experience, to be a pretty decent tactical combat game with extra added roleplaying bits. D&amp;D was pretty much ever thus but now the tactical side has been sharpened up no end and is on par, and possibly better than, the tactical experience of WoW and other such games. But being a tactical combat game, it does run rather slowly. Resolution of situations is much slower than I like meaning that the story doesn't move along very quickly. For those of us who are story gamers, this is a bit of a drag. As is, I find, the whole levelling up business. It's so OOC and artificial.<br/><br/>But for those people who like this kind of game, which is, let's face it, the vast majority of gamers, I think WotC have delivered. I really do hope that the game does well because it's the biggest lever around for getting more people into gaming, more potential story gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148799/#Comment_148799" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T05:15:43+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  5:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>So why I am posting this now?

It's always good to hear you're not alone!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite>Both can co-exist in harmony, they don't need to knife fight in a phone booth.</blockquote>\nNot sure I entirely agree. I don't think you have to be all or nothing, but there <i>is</i> a limited player base. I started going to local cons in May 2000. In August 2000, 3rd Edition launched. Within a few years, the non-D&amp;D and non-D20 games available at local cons had dwindled significantly. There used to be a lot of other options available, but by the middle of the decade it felt like all anyone wanted to play was D20. Now I was heavily into D20 at the time, so I didn't feel it as acutely as others, but I still felt it. I enjoyed trying out new games, that was one of my facvorite things about cons, and I didn't have as many options as I used to.<br/><br/>As 3.5 was winding down, a lot of new stuff (including Story Games I brought) emerged at the cons: Serenity, Savage Worlds, etc. I think there's another trough in the sine wave headed my way and in a couple years no one at the cons will be interested in the non-D&amp;D stuff. But I've only got one cycle's evidence, so who knows? It might be the nature of the hobby to swing back-and-forth like that, but maybe it's more of a 20 year cycle where 4E will be more like 2E in the long run.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I really do hope that the game does well because it's the biggest lever around for getting more people into gaming, more potential story gamers.</blockquote>\nI agree. Now how long is it polite to wait before I try to steal the newbies away to play Story Games? (I guess the answer is "about 12 hours" for Carl!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148800/#Comment_148800" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T05:16:47+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  5:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Moreno">@Moreno</a>: your issue is clearly stated in the first paragraph. You have a lot of *DnD (bad) experience.<br/><br/>There are basically two kinds of people that are non particularly happy with 4E, in my experience: people who came to hate DnD because of the long and painful exposure (mostly to ADnD), and people who never abandoned it through the editions, bitching but buying manuals (LOTS of manuals) because it was their pet game. Sure, it had changed, but it was still DnD, trying (in their minds) to simulate the imaginary world of whatever.<br/><br/>Both groups can't really enjoy 4E, IMO: you and the ones who left, disgusted, cannot really stand anything dnd anymore. The others are stunned by the sudden change: after 20+ years of (badly executed) Sim drift and "toolkit system" that allegedly "allowed you do do whatever you wanted"... they get a strongly Gam system, with no support for Sim play and a very strong skirmish tactical bent. Yeah, it's a different game (or at least looks very much like one).<br/><br/>...that's why I got interested. I don't have the baggage. I don't even have the emotional baggage: I played briefly red box DnD when I was very young, and even if it was the first game, and it brought me into the hobby... I did not have that much fun.

Indie games aren't going to go anywhere.  In fact, Wizards basically ceded the territory of games that take a more narrative approach to play, allowing the 3.x crowd, White Wolf (and other larger games companies), and small press games to continue down that road while D&amp;D4 goes the way of Iron Heroes + Agon.  Honestly, I expect this will actually serve to increase the diversity of roleplaying in the long run, even if, temporarily, the excitement about D&amp;D4 seems to obscure many of the other options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148811/#Comment_148811" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T06:46:26+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  6:46AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2008 6:48AM by renatoram.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite><br/><br/>There are two types of people in this world.

The entire rest of my RPG pie-chart is filled by other games that do what they do well.<br/><br/>4E comes out and abandons that niche. But... it's got nowhere to go. If I wanted to play a gamist, tactics-heavy RPG, I'd play Agon. If I wanted to play a tactical minis game, well, WotC has already sold me that game. If I wanted to play WoW... I don't anymore, that's why I stopped played WoW.<br/><br/>In changing niche, 4E also dropped a bunch of things that were the primary appeal of 3.5 to my wife and I. The change in magic is a big thing: 4E has basically no out-of-combat magic. No, the tiny rituals chapter doesn't cut it. Characters no longer change in such dramatic ways: you don't completely throw out the entire tactical and strategic landscape every 5 levels anymore.<br/><br/>It might be a good game, but I honestly don't care. I've already got great games that don't require me to read 550 pages of text (Player's Handbook + DMG pagecount), and DnD 3.5 already gives me the experience I want out of a DnD game.<br/><br/>One last thing on the 4E tactical experience - we, as a people, frequently broke 3.5 supplements before they were actually released (infinite loops, irresistible 1-hit kills, etc...). I don't think we ever solved the game before release, however, as we have with 4E - solved as in blackjack, where optimal play is precisely known and the only interesting thing is how the random number generator every-so-slightly tweaks things this particular time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148847/#Comment_148847" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T11:49:49+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 11:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is in no way surprising to me that elements of the online community hate 4e for being too "theory inspired" and elements of the online gaming community have a negative reaction about it being <i>popular</i> amongst 'story-gamers.' <br/><br/>And '4enfraude' is a great term.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148897/#Comment_148897" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T18:56:27+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  6:56PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            re the issue of 4e focusing on combat, I think the Skill Challenge and "stunts" parts of the DMG provide quite a bit of scope to broaden things.  They can make issues that were just "painfully dull" in 3.5 interesting (e.g., the roll for getting lost, calculating the travel time effects, random encounters in long distance travel was a pain in my view, translated into a Skill Challenge this is now playable in a narrative fashion).<br/><br/>The fact that magic has been "cut back" from spells that "nerf" various non-combat challenges is attractive to me.  It means that outside of the battlefield, it is "all about the skills, all about rituals, all about roleplaying baby!"  The Wizard and the Warlock aren't actually better when it comes to most of life's real challenges than are the Fighter or Paladin.  It also means there are fewer magical effects whizzing about that undermine the assumptions of a medieval society.  It looks like it actually makes sense to build castles in a 4e world - whoo hoo!<br/><br/>Now lots of games run in 4e may hardly ever spend any time not on a battlefield and sketch what's between those times, and of course 4e is mostly about the battlefield and pretending otherwise is silly.  If you want good narratively inspiring story-producing play, go play In A Wicked Age.  I admit my perfect gaming place is likely 50% 4e and 50% IAWA, scratching different issues.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148903/#Comment_148903" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T19:21:57+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  7:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eric,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>we, as a people, frequently broke 3.5 supplements before they were actually released (infinite loops, irresistible 1-hit kills, etc...).

Yes, you can build a character to be an optimal combat machine, but with skill challenges, you may find that you've skipped something you wind up needing.  And further, once you've built that "optimal combat machine", you still have to play it, which comes down to your tactical skill.<br/><br/>A little bit of searching finds that "Tekken-juggling" seems to be what they'd call "stun-locking" in WoW -- repeatedly using abilities that cause your opponent to "lose turn", so they don't get to do anything.  This may be optimal against a single foe, but it seems to me to be much more difficult when you're dealing with, say, eight to ten foes -- as we were in each of the combats in the adventure I played in.  Sure, you could cooperate to keep one or two of them locked down, but the others are going to be attacking you while you do that.  Complicating this is that most of the "stun" powers are encounter or daily powers, severely limiting just how long you can keep a target "locked".<br/><br/>It's recognizably a good tactic, but I don't think it's a game-breaker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149047/#Comment_149047" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T12:51:25+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 12:51PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 1:55PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>A little bit of searching finds that "Tekken-juggling" seems to be what they'd call "stun-locking" in WoW</blockquote>\nYou also need to include fear-kiting, frost shock-kiting... actually, all forms of action limitation-based kiting. Juggling in Tekken is different than the original sense of the fighting game term "juggling" in that it's hard to keep an enemy in the air for very long, but there are lots of ways to make an enemy unable to do something that you care about for a little while. So, for example, spinning someone sideways also counts, since they have to spin back and that takes time.<br/><br/>***edit: but yeah, stun-locking is great if you can manage it\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>but with skill challenges, you may find that you've skipped something you wind up needing.</blockquote>\nI honestly don't care that the DM could check everyone's sheet and come up with a set of out-of-combat skill rolls that we're minimally likely to succeed on. Also, making sure Team PC can beat the entire MM with a very small set of tactics and making sure that Team PC has a good coverage of skills aren't mutually exclusive in the least. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>... Complicating this is that most of the "stun" powers are encounter or daily powers, severely limiting just how long you can keep a target "locked".</blockquote>\nYou're doing it wrong. This isn't about making them unable to take an action, but rather unable to take an action that hurts you. Ray of Frost accomplishes the same thing as a stun against a large fraction of the MM and is at-will. <br/><br/>A party of all Elf Rangers beats a large swath of MM encounters, solos and groups, without ever taking damage at all and without using any encounter or daily powers - actual juggles aren't even needed in many cases, just a willingness to hit-and-run endlessly. You start juggling when you can't just vanilla kite.<br/><br/>Note that "solving" the game doesn't mean you always win, my glib initial reference to tekken-juggling aside. Solving checkers has assured that every properly-played match ends in a draw, for example, and optimal blackjack play wins on average but might suffer a loss over any given hour of play.

But if you're telling me with a straight face that I don't have room to talk since some of your friends talk a bigger game than they can walk... whatever. Action denial and hit-and-run are very basic concepts in turn-based games tactical games, and the degree to which they can be executed easily and repetitively is one of the basic measures of the degeneracy of this sort of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149071/#Comment_149071" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T13:26:05+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  1:26PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2008 1:31PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I wiped the floor with a guy who'd proclaimed that Ra was broken and he'd "solved" it. .</blockquote>\nRa is a bidding game corresponding to some sort of auction with randomization of what you're bidding on, yes?

The entire rest of my RPG pie-chart is filled by other games that do what they do well.<br/><br/>4E comes out and abandons that niche. But... it's got nowhere to go. If I wanted to play a gamist, tactics-heavy RPG, I'd play Agon. If I wanted to play a tactical minis game, well, WotC has already sold me that game. If I wanted to play WoW... I don't anymore, that's why I stopped played WoW.<br/><br/>In changing niche, 4E also dropped a bunch of things that were the primary appeal of 3.5 to my wife and I. The change in magic is a big thing: 4E has basically no out-of-combat magic. No, the tiny rituals chapter doesn't cut it. Characters no longer change in such dramatic ways: you don't completely throw out the entire tactical and strategic landscape every 5 levels anymore.<br/><br/>It might be a good game, but I honestly don't care.

Drop Evocation and your choice of something else that isn't Transmutation; ditching Enchantment or Illusion is common, since they accomplish similar things, or Necromancy, since the real Necro rockstar spells are mostly higher-level. I usually drop Necromancy, though using Command Undead to make poke-armies of mindless undead without a save is hilarious.<br/><br/>You're going to be casting the following spells in combat:<br/>Level 1 - Grease, Color Spray, Sleep<br/>Level 2 - Glitterdust, Web <br/><br/>Most of these spells render enemies vulnerable to sneak attacks, so the rogue loves you. They all make it easier to hit the enemy, so everyone who makes attack rolls loves you. They all limit or deny enemies actions, so you're also defending everyone.<br/><br/>Out of combat, special consideration goes to Enlarge Person if someone can meaningfully benefit from it. It lasts a minute per level, so try to pre-cast it from a scroll.<br/><br/>Carry a reach weapon at level 1, regardless of proficiency. The chance to get an AoO against a charging enemy and drop it is worth it, and those 1 HD orcs and goblins and such that you'll invariably face may well fall down despite your lousy strength. Besides, you weren't using that hand for anything else anyway. You'll have a light crossbow, too.

forward to receiving the box from Amazon. It was dirt cheap with the current dollar-krone-rating, so I thought why not. The red D&amp;D-book with the Elmore-drawing on, translated into Norwegian, was one of the first RPGs I bought. A bit of nostalgia. And we're starting up a 4th ed campaign for the summer. D&amp;D is a huge brand name still, that millions of people play on a monthly basis (according to Wizards' own figures, if I'm not mistaken). Belonging to the small Norwegian gaming community, I think that's pretty impressive. Especially in the age of online gaming. When I interviewed Gygax a couple of years ago, he criticized Wizards for having spent too little on marketing. He also criticized the latest years editions for moving too much in the direction of World of Warcraft-type computer games. I don't know. I hope the new edition will suck new kids into the hobby. That it's simple enough that a 13 year old can pick it up and have fun with it. That it'll appeal to a new generation of gamers. I've had lots of fun with "traditional games" like D&amp;D, Gurps, Shadowrun, Aberrant, etc, but I've always had trouble learning the rules. And ended up with freeform type play. Which suited me fine. My game Itras by is due to be launched this summer, and is very much based on impro/freeform ideas. I've been very happy with a lot of the "storygame" type stuff, especially things like Primetime, Baron von Munchausen and Play Unsafe, and a lot of the stuff over at norwegianstyle.wordpress.com. But in parallel with the more "experimental" games, we've had tons of fun with Star Wars d20 (I especially liked the simplifications and updates in the Saga edition). It's all good. Variations. I dig McDonalds, I dig gourmet shit. Which is which is for anyone to decide. <br/><br/>Sorry for the rambling. It's getting late. And H\xe5ken is reading Gorby's future from out of Tomas' collection of poems...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149431/#Comment_149431" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-10T16:25:24+00:00" title="June 10, 2008  4:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>Anyone else feel like that?</blockquote>\nI'm not exactly a model member of the SG community, but yeah. 4e is not lighting my fire. I mean it seems like a nice playable game, just one tuned to sensibilities other than mine.<br/><br/>I regret the narrow focus. I was into D&amp;D for the fantasy elements built up though it's history, elements which I shaped into a setting of my own. That the game was broader was a good thing to me, as it let a group of us with disparate tastes gather at the same table and enjoy each other's company. I could run my setting driven game, the tacticians could take on the tactical challenges, the puzzle solvers deal with the mysteries, and so forth. I don't think the narrower 4e will serve as effectively as a bridge for a 4e group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_149515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149515/#Comment_149515" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-11T00:42:14+00:00" title="June 11, 2008 12:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2008 12:44AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: olepeder</cite>It's all good.

Take a nice farewell to your hope.<br/><br/>I hope you get something out of your campaign. You're all inventive players, so you should be able to pick some ... eh ... glass-beads out of the muck. However: reading the "Ok, so it's not perfect"-thread makes me think you should keep your expectations of the game itself on a low level.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: olepeder</cite>Reading Gorbys future out of Tomas' collection of poems</blockquote> <b><i>What </i></b>are you doing with my games!?
