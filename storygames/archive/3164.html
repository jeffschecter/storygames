TSOY is already ready to help them break some habits and join the fun I enjoy (if they're willing) and vis a vis the Dungeon Crawl set up they feel even more at ease and it provides a backdrop they know intuitively, allowing them to truly focus on the new ideas within.<br/><br/>One problem I've had in developing Jason's idea of a TSOY Dungeon Crawl (see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2855" rel="nofollow">here</a>,  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2275" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1907" rel="nofollow">here</a>) is that in a Dungeon Crawl there are limited if not downright no opportunities for Pool Refreshment, if you want to keep the atmosphere of 'Mercenaries on a Mission' (i.e. Why would your party of adventurers continuously avoid their targets and the danger of them to have a foot race or make love?). <br/><br/>The first thing I do is make it one easy definition for Pool Refreshment: refuel yourself by showing us (via a roleplayed scene) your humanity (even if you're not a human). I also tend to stress not making this scene come to dice. This means an intensely roleplayed scene or just an evolving relationship (serving as a break from an action scene) can serve to fix you up. It makes the Cleric's job really fun, in my opinion. Finally, I ask that the players ask for Refresh scenes on their own - not to have me ask them if they need to Refresh. It's a simple thing, but asking for a scene soon leans toward the ability to frame a scene on your own.<br/><br/>However, I've seen it being glossed over and get handwavey (i.e. we wave our hands and so and so is refreshed). <br/><br/>So, here's my new thing I'd like to try (and ask for opinions on): maybe the best thing to do would be to Frame Flashbacks as your Refresh Scenes. And here's how I would do it:<br/><br/>Since one of the facets of this gameplay involves a slightly stronger GM than I've played with TSOY in the past (but still considerably lighter than a D&amp;D GM), the GM should be the full rights scene framer for flashbacks in the beginning. My belief is that once the players get the idea of how these flashbacks should work they'll be able to frame them themselves (or, at the least, ask the GM to frame the scene with their input). \n<ol>\n<li>Ask the players which characters should be in the scene.</li>\n<li>Determine which motif you want to hit in the scene: the Impact of  Violence for Vigor, the Love for Another for Instinct, and a Quandry of Loyalties for Reason.<br/><br/></li><li>Determine an NPC you want to involve in the scene. For Violence, have the NPC orchestrate the Violence but not be directly involved. For Instinct, try to have the NPC be the object of affection or try to break up the Love, and for Reason, have the actions of the NPC be the cause for the issue of Loyalty.</li>\n<li>Try to foreshadow of postshadow events in the game; give yourself something to reincorporate or reincorporate something that has happened.</li>\n</ol>\nSo, if one is making a TSOY Dungeon Crawl from scratch, look at it like a puzzle. Make your PCs backgrounds and Keys fit together with a tight groove, and form the center of the picture. Have your Flashback Scenes prepared to surround the PCs and form the middle, but leave room for real action and events. Don't roleplay the game before it happens! Have the Dungeon form the border of the puzzle. Then let the pieces fall where they may.<br/><br/>Thoughts? I'm sure I'll need to rewrite what I've got already and try this out to see what I come up with.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72378/#Comment_72378" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T09:49:39+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  9:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 10:07AM by oliof.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/>I love what you're doing with the TSoY Dungeon Crawl stuff.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are nice, but they may be just a bit too\xe2\u20ac\xa6 story-like to be accepted easily. As an option, I like them very much.<br/><br/>Did you consider redoing the refreshment stuff completeley? If there's a difference between the core of TSoY proper (i.e. on Near; where the core is about [re]defining your humanity) and TSoY Dungeon Crawl, shouldn't the theme of refreshment scenes also change from social interaction to \xe2\u20ac\xa6 dungeon-relevant stuff? Camp building scene? Dividing loot? Preparing your wizardly resources? Or is this too much on the Dungeon Crawl side and not enough on the TSoY side? (Going this far might entail the need to re-image pools altogether)<br/><br/>On the other hand, not being able to refresh in the dungeon could add to the scenery \xe2\u20ac\u201c it would make for a mechanical representation of the drive to get back to the outside, where people, games, lovers, songs and all that can be enjoyed again.<br/><br/>[edited for germanisms]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72390/#Comment_72390" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T10:30:56+00:00" title="May 29, 2007 10:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!

That's what I'm going for to help break people out of the mode of Strength is only for this and Will is only for that.

I see what you're saying and agree with you.  I was just throwing the other Pool names out there as kinda Dungeonish.<br/><br/>Well, my first reaction is to remember what this is.  It's a dungeon crawl.  It isn't really free-form hippie-story.  So, I'd tend to make refreshes at certain points in the narrative/dungeon.  Drink from the Fountain of Magical Coolaid for a Vigor refreshment.  Read the Tome of Knowledge Likely to Kill You Dead for a Reason refreshment.  Outwit the Riddling Sphincter of Hell for an Instinct refreshment.  There should be an element of resource managemtent here so I'd probably only allow each of the refreshments once during the adventure.  That makes deciding who should get it and when a bit more a decision.  If you don't want that kind of decision making then either have lots of different spots to refresh or make some reusable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72409/#Comment_72409" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T11:26:01+00:00" title="May 29, 2007 11:26AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/RPG_Lexica:DEF" rel="nofollow">Back to basics ...</a><br/><br/><b>Dungeon Crawl</b><br/>A style of rpg play wherein the main activity of the characters is the exploration of physical sites (designed and described by the GM) in the face of violent opposition. Particular aspects usually include the <i><b>careful mapping of the location</b></i>, the importance and <i><b>attention to details of the environment</b></i> (the effect of which are significant to the success of the exploration) and the <i><b>search for items of value</b></i>. Specifically, "dungeon-crawling" usually refers to classic D&amp;D-style play centered upon the conquest of underground regions, usually labrynthine "dungeons" wherein various hostile monsters make their residence, guarding hoards of treasure, which is in often further guarded by <i><b>diabolical traps</b></i>. Such dungeons are often designed with little regard to ecology, economy, or common sense, though this is as often offered part of their charm as much as a criticism. Generally a very combat-oriented type of gameplay, and thus usually a subset of Hack and Slash. "Dungeon-crawling" can also be used to refer to scenarios other than those from the fantasy genre, if the essential character is still the same. For instance, a party of salvagers exploring a mysterious abandoned starship, or a band of cyberpunks raiding a corporate headquarters.<br/><br/><i><b>emphasis mine</b></i><br/><br/>So, what if we get out of the restriction of roleplaying a scene for Refreshment?

I just wanted to add that while Pool refreshment is trickier in a dungeon, it should be.  But you can perhaps make up for it a bit with some creativity and "shorter" refreshment scenes, like a "throwaway" combat where the PCs are trying to see who can kill more goblins or whatever.  Or even just a breather, where one merc gives another "two for flinching", or has his buddy watch his back while he takes off part of his armor and limbers up a bit.  All Vigor there.  Dungeon puzzles and debates about tactics or monster biology are good for Reason, and any kind of break where the mercs talk about anything other than business could fix Instinct.  "Your mamma" jokes, bawdy limericks, colorful anectdotes and even comiseration might fill that scene.<br/><br/>Just some brief thoughts.  Basically lowering your "standards" for what counts as a refreshment scene, I think.

The pace was intense.<br/><br/>So -- pool refreshment? One character literally <i>never</i> got to refresh his Vigor pool: Every time he got a new Vigor point, he did it by spending XP. Fortunately, everyone was hitting Keys like mad, so the average player-character easily got three to five Advances (i.e. 15-25 XP) per session.<br/><br/>The one problem with TSOY for "dungeon crawl" is that I've found it very, very hard to come up with "monsters" that the protagonists can't drop in one good roll. After a few sessions, even at the slower rates of advance in our current TSOY/Burning Empires game -- typically just 1-2 advances per session -- every player-character has a Master skill and a bunch of pool points, and even opponents with Grand Master level abilities start going down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72603/#Comment_72603" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T04:55:46+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  4:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, true - antagonists aren't exactly the easiest for a Dungeon Crawl.

So they were very comfortable taking control of the story, and I was very comfortable giving it to them.<br/><br/>My whole job as GM boiled down to:<br/>(1) think about what the players have put in their Keys, talked about, and done in past sessions;<br/>(2) prep NPCs and a situation that hit those Keys as hard as possible, in a way that would not only force the players to react but also <i>reward </i>them for reacting, without having any particular expectation of <i>how</i> they would react;<br/>(3) improvise madly in play as my players surprise me by doing something I hadn't thought of<br/>(4) end the session and return to step one.<br/><br/>A typical session involved one location in the "dungeon" (ruined city), built around one major "guest star" NPC, that NPC's agenda,  their minions, and the opportunities &amp; threats for the survival of the player-characters' band of refugees. There was always a choice between fighting the NPC (whether socially or physically) or collaborating with them. There was also almost always conflict between the player-characters and continuing "good guy" NPCs representing rival points of view among the refugees, and very frequently conflict between player-characters as well.<br/><br/>All this typically took up an entire several hour session, and a good thing too, because by the time the players had gone through a particular location-situation-major NPC combo, they had done so many things I hadn't expected that any plans I might have had for follow-on were in tatters and I needed to revise radically. I did have an overall "relationship map" of major NPCs in the ruined city and what they wanted from the player-characters, but I made up <i>all</i> those NPCs <i>after</i> the players generated their characters. In fact, I made up the r-map of major NPCs only after we'd played out the introductory session, about being pursued to the gates of the ruined city: When that first session ended as the player-characters walked through the main gate into the "dungeon," I had <i>no idea</i> what they were going to find on the other side. I custom-built the whole thing to hit the characters and their Keys as hard as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73082/#Comment_73082" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T07:24:21+00:00" title="June  1, 2007  7:24AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, this is good stuff.  Sorry I've been on vacation and didn't see this until now.  A couple of thoughts:<br/><br/>1.  This seems optimized for a one-shot play experience.  I'm not sure it would be a sustainable model.  That's totally OK.<br/>2.  Given 1, Sydney's description of pools as an essentially non-renewable resource rings true.  Pools become sort of like hit points, which are another way to lower the alleged barrier to entry.  I'd scrupulously avoid changing anything or adding anything unless it is absolutely necessary - the game is well tuned and has everything you need.  <br/>3.  In my experience, "monsters" are pretty much impossible to pull of in a satisfying way in a human-scale game like TSOY (and I've tried).  The answer to this is to make the crawl not about monsters so much.  Make them part of the larger fabric of challenge, there to let the players say things about stuff that matters to them.<br/>4.  What you are working on here has diverged dramatically from BPGs plans, so I encourage you to make it your own and let us learn from you!
