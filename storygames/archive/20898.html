In fact (and this is totally not about dissing on Deliverator's take, just discussing the more general topic) the idea of social combat is pretty flawed in general for most games exactly because it's not how people usually function socially, and thus it's an awkward fit.<br/><br/>My own go-to solution for simple D&amp;D situations (like, old school or primitive improvised stuff or whatever) does, however, link with the hit point scheme nowadays: the more I play D&amp;D, the more I think that the HP currency should be involved in most things. The way I do this is by simply deciding that characters can take HP damage from psychological pressures such as worry, stress, fear and whatnot. (Most of the time it's purposeful for these injuries to be minor, just a few points at once; they are somewhat likely to be on-going, though.)<br/><br/>For the sake of the comedy, let's say that psychological damage is like falling damage, which famously comes from the simple formula of [depth of the pit in 10s of feet, +1 if there are spikes]d6. Because psychological damage rarely suffices to drive people into dysfunction (zero HP, I mean), let's say that it's d4s instead. This gives us a hilarious yet appropriate formula:<br/><br/>[depth of the psychological shock in stages of grief, +1 if it's eldritch]d4<br/><br/>That should get one started with psychological damage <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> If psychological damage results in real injury (also known as falling to 0 HP), the consequence is, of course, moral failure, insanity or other immediate, dramatic freak-out that makes the character combat-incapable. If one sticks with a D&amp;D system where 0 kills (instead of merely starts an incapacitation subsystem), maybe they die of fright or stress, then.<br/><br/>Once you have some standards for how psychological damage works, you can get a sort of a "social combat system" by having it that the characters are capable of establishing relationship states with each other, and of using these states to imbue each other with further effects. For example, a character might make a Charisma check (plus spend the time and money and risk various exposure) to establish a friendship between himself and another character, which additional trust then enables them to hurt the other easier with e.g. betrayal - an extra 1d4 psych damage when they turn on their supposed friend later, say. On the other hand, a character doing such undercover skullduggery might need to make periodical saving rolls so as to not have the friendship turn mutual, which might present its own problems.<br/><br/>Here the idea of "friendship" is dealt with as essentially a status tag that we can manipulate with game mechanics, and upon which we can premise further game mechanics. Obviously you can establish other similar tags as necessary, like "infantuation", "love", "loyalty" or whatever.<br/><br/>(A practical example from last week: an anti-heroic PC meets an evil, potentially unreliable elven priestess who, after brief interaction, decides to try to seduce him. The PC tries to seduce her back. After a few dice rolls we establish that both end up mutually "infantuated" for now. Later on the two interacted some more, and I gave the player the choice this time: their character would either fall in "love", or the "infantuation" would go away, depending on how the PC reacted to getting to know the elven priestess better. The player did not know how the priestess's feelings developed, but he could've attempted an appropriate sort of observation check to figure it out. After deciding to fall in love, the PC has the special privileges you might expect me to hook into that status, mechanically speaking: they can get quest XP for helping their lady love, moderate situational bonuses for defending them in combat, whatever.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458732/#Comment_458732" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-16T21:26:55+00:00" title="December 16, 2016  9:26PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>The traditional conception of social combat is that it's about getting somebody to do something for you. There is also a certain technical agenda, a fascination towards making the social play mechanical in the same way combat is - that's likely why social combat mechanics tend to parallel combat mechanics. Although I don't necessarily think that a heavily regimented parallel system is desirable, I'll make a few suggestions anyway for how I might go about it:<br/><b>*</b> When you want something from another character, you need to offer them a balance of motivations that favours them: once all factors have been accounted for, a character will favour the choice that is better for them. For this reason social combat is about developing leverage within the mind of your "opponent", so that what initially seemed like an unfavourable choice becomes favourable after all.<br/><b>*</b> Create a way to roughly linearize and quantify the various social factors that influence decision-making. For instance, give numerical values to social statuses such as I posited before: a "friendship" is worth +4, a "love" is worth +8, whatever. You'll want to quantify stuff like blackmail, bribes, a Charm Person spell (I assume that this is exactly like "friendship", by the way, in terms of social effects), so you can compare the scales for social combat.<br/><b>*</b> After doing the above you can say stuff like "the Baroness is up three points to resist your heart-felt appeal; she is affected by your polite manners, but she favours just court procedure more, and your friend was rude to her, so she sticks to her guns on this." This enables you to discuss social situations in mechanical terms with the other players in a quite concrete way, and it's all actionable: a character can try stuff to change another's mind, they can see whether there's any progress, they can give up, whatever.<br/><b>*</b> To convince someone, you'll need to establish new leverage on them. This may be in the form of reasonable arguments, emotional appeals, whatever. Perhaps you'll hang about for a month and build up a trusting friendship, which suffices to tip the scales. All of this can be mechanized into skill checks, utilizing your favourite type of continuous task math as necessary - maybe establishing a new social status requires a long-term effort instead of just a simple dice roll. (For example, I tend to simulate continuous tasks by setting a DC and counting "successes", of which one needs to accumulate so and so many without failing too badly at any single roll on the way - not too unlike the WW Storytelling system's way, really.)<br/><b>*</b> This approach can be simply expanded into more complex situations: if there are third parties trying to "defend" against your convincing a character of something, then they're there, they're acting on the same time-scale you are, and their actions will change the sum totals on the social scales, just like yours do. If there are multiple concurrent issues, just run multiple sets of scales. Easy-peasy.<br/><b>*</b> Note that social combat can be run on multiple time-scales, but the various types of leverage that characters can use are not all so easy to whip up on a moment's notice, which is why characters sometime need more time to convince each other of something. Generally the resistance against drastic actions is higher than that for frivolous actions, which is why a character can seduce another in near combat-time (in the best case), but getting somebody to betray their country will probably take months of work to establish enough leverage. Specifically, this system refutes the idea that a social solution <i>must</i> be available here and now, in this scene; it's entirely possible that the scene ends with no change to the initial opinions simply because after the calculation and initial maneuvers the players conclude that no sufficient leverage is available today.<br/><b>*</b> Note that the psychological damage conceit I suggested earlier slots in naturally here, depending on the kind of psychological damage. For example, a Fighter intimidating somebody hard enough to cause HP damage might get an immediate +2 per HP lost on the social scales (that psych damage was, after all, indicating that the target is really afraid of the fighter). On the other hand, a lover who says something nasty to you and by this mere act causes you 1d4 damage might get a +6 because they have just demonstrated that they do, in fact, hold your heart in their palm - to crush or console, apparently, considering how easy it is for them to hurt you. (Maybe that +6 is not temporary, in fact; you might just gain the tag "dependent" once the lover has established that you're that much under their spell.)<br/><b>*</b> Player characters also can be targets of social combat, easily enough. Just assume that each character gets an inherent "I act just as my player wants me to" bonus equal to their Wisdom score or other suitable number, and let the player assign that bonus on whatever side of the scales they want. (This bonus basically replaces all sorts of "I would never kill an innocent" types of conviction bonuses that NPCs would have instead, simply because it's a waste of time to define such particulars for PCs formally when you can just have the player make spot decisions.) Then you just calculate like you would for a NPC. This means that in a suitably one-sided situation a PC may form beliefs or even act specifically in a different way than the player would wish them to; decide for yourself if that's part of your D&amp;D system, it's easy enough to make the PCs immune to social combat if you're a wuss.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458733/#Comment_458733" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-16T22:26:11+00:00" title="December 16, 2016 10:26PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>How do you distinguish between a "Minor" compromise, "Major", and etc?

As you'd remember, I believe the true, challengeful, organically wargamey D&amp;D to be about a hierarchical application of Methods -&gt; Rulings -&gt; Rules - this means that the act of play basically generates new rules ideas as you go along, inevitably. There's just been some social warfare in play lately, wherefore my current ideas on how to handle it.<br/><br/>My current strategy emerges from the free-wheeling strategic layer of play, where players often utilize social maneuvers to improve upon the frame of their challenge. The basis for me has always been one-roll conflict resolution (basically an "Ability check" in the Basic D&amp;D sense) with success-counting to quantify and provide a currency for post-roll negotiations. This tides me over that "social combat" aspect most of the time, really, as I have generally not had a personal interest in making it mechanically detailed; it suffices to establish what characters want, how difficult it is to convince the counter-party, roll some dice, get whatever number of successes, and then establish the details by negotiation.<br/><br/>(Although I have to say that now that I wrote down some ideas for a more quantified sort of "social combat", I could maybe see myself using that at some point, too. I suppose it'd depend on whether the players would feel interested in that "scales-balancing" calculation thing; I'd rather do it openly at the table, with everybody pitching in to list reasons for the given NPC to agree or disagree with a PC proposition. I'm sure to save introducing that for a complex and detailed situation, though - doing that for an ordinary haggling or information-pumping situation would be much too much work for the benefit.)<br/><br/>However, this approach does nothing for two elements of play that I expounded upon above - namely, psychological damage and the formal tracking of social capital. I've wanted to add former to my oeuvre for horror thriller purposes, basically (I think it'd be interesting if seeing e.g. a mutilated corpse were a bigger deal for green adventurers, for example), while the latter is necessary for making NPC interactions less arbitrary: when you have established standards for e.g. how difficult it is to establish a trusted working relationship with a fence, it becomes easier and more fun for the players to strategize about it. Sort of emphasizes the social fluency aspects of being a thief-type adventurer.<br/><br/>(I should note that this relationship status thing both is and isn't an old-school method: its forebear is the Basic D&amp;D encounter reaction check, which produces a sort of a "relationship modality" that the GM uses to guide his rp interaction within the context of a single encounter scene. However, historically mainstream D&amp;D never developed free-floating relationship statuses out of this, instead opting for various types of social capital statistics - Fame and Honor being the most prominent, perhaps.)<br/><br/>As for what concretely inspired me on this: we've been playing a fresh leg of our long-running "historical D&amp;D" campaign since early spring here in Upper Savo, with the 31s session occurring next Tuesday. the driving mechanical "theme" for me this time around has been emphasizing personal uniqueness of the characters, which has meant introducing a full-blown skill system (it's actually really clever, too - different from the usual D&amp;D skill whirlygigs) as the main new feature. I think that the importance of social capital has been emphasized as an emergent side effect of the skill system: the game is set in 1360 Sweden, while about half of the characters are English mercenaries (for some weird player inspiration reason, not my idea), which means that those tend to take some continuous skill penalties for stuff like talking to the locals and knowing the area. This in turn inspires me to emphasize the unique social capital, or lack thereof, of each player character, particularly when the Englishmen hire locals to guide them (as in, one of the PCs is a local guy). At the end of that road is the fact that it's a <i>big deal</i> whether your character personally has a trusted relationship to an underground fence or a warsome local nobleman or evil elf priestess, because it's not a given that a character can get that sort of social capital just like that with the skill system being what it is, and those relations are often a necessity for securing supplies, information, adventure hooks and so on. Once we're on the road to these sorts of social resources being a big deal, it becomes a necessity to create clearer guidelines for how they are established and tracked, and what <i>exactly</i> they do in the game - and thus, we've arrived at this social status approach that I described. I don't know if that made any sense, I'm trying to be succinct about explaining a creative development that occurred over the last nine months or so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458747/#Comment_458747" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-18T05:43:08+00:00" title="December 18, 2016  5:43AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over time, I've gone to using a simple resolution mechanic for social conficts (esp.

Specifically, <i>Dust Devils</i> basically has a "social combat" system in its general conflict resolution via mutual injury, and long-term play has shown that players will basically build up emergent constructive systems on top of the inherently destructive mechanical base. It's like, when all you can do socially is to hurt the other people, the fact that you don't gains increased significance, and trust is based on mutual capability to hurt.<br/><br/>I wrote a game draft a while back that explores the implications of this sort of social rules set-up a bit, <a href="https://isabout.wordpress.com/valravnar-for-asagrimmr/" rel="nofollow">Valravnar for \xc1sagrimmr</a>. The basic proposition in that game is that social combat is only possible for characters who actually have some social ties between them (complete strangers have no hold on each other), but the act of social combat itself erodes these ties, so pressuring others into conforming to your will is only affirmative of the relationship when you <i>give up</i>, thus proving that you value the relationship more than whatever it was that was at stake in the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458756/#Comment_458756" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T08:51:48+00:00" title="December 19, 2016  8:51AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's like, when all you can do socially is to hurt the other people, the fact that you don't gains increased significance, and trust is based on mutual capability to hurt.</blockquote>\nWell, not quite. It's also the fact that even if, mechanically, you are "hurting" someone by eroding their SHP, if you do it by means of polite, empathetic persuasion, that's very different than doing it via threats, lies, and intimidation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458757/#Comment_458757" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T08:56:55+00:00" title="December 19, 2016  8:56AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2016 8:59AM by BeePeeGee.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>BeePeeGee,<br/>I like the elegance of a table and a simple d6 roll. <br/>How do you use it at the table, though?

Usually, it is a PvP situation.<br/>- First, before the roll, each party states their position.<br/>- If one party should have the <i>upper-hand</i>, it should be also clarified prior to rolling.<br/>- The die can be rolled either <i>before or during</i> roleplaying.<br/>    o If you roll before roleplaying, you clarify out-of-character what it means, then roleplay it.<br/>    o If you roll during roleplaying, you improvise in-character accordingly. <br/>- If someone is unhappy with things, they can raise the issue out-of-character and ultimately the (current) GM will decide.<br/>Note that I use this mechanic usually in a <i>highly collaborative</i> environment. So, usually players give each other a lot of permission for interpretation.<br/><br/><i>Example:<br/>The village council debates if they should join the duke's army in the current revolt.<br/>A: Tomrin, the village leader wants to join them with full forces.<br/>B: Seykhel, his brother, would like to stay out of the conflict completely.<br/>(Since Tomrin is the village leader, he has the upper-hand in the conflict)<br/>- If either A or B dominates, the village will cheeringly accept their proposition. The other party will give in.<br/>- If they reach a compromise, i.e. maybe they will send out a small delegation to the duke yet officially stay out of the conflict.<br/>- If they disagree, the conflict is not resolved. The village is divided and at each others' throats.<br/>The players start roleplaying the scene. In-character, both Tomrin and Seykhel address the council and present their positions.<br/>**Die is rolled. Result is a '3'. Since Tomrin (A) has the upper-hand, it is adjusted to a '4'. This means disagreement with possibly A slightly on top. **<br/>The villagers disagree and there are some ugly exchanges. Seykhel is furious and rushes out of the room.<br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458760/#Comment_458760" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-19T17:16:01+00:00" title="December 19, 2016  5:16PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the social conflicts I deal with IRL are not "I have leverage, or you have leverage, and we duke it out until someone wins."<br/><br/>They're more like, we both have the ability to harm each other socially, and we both want different things, and we generally want the best thing for the group but we have different beliefs about how to get there. We need to talk through those differences and reach a compromise, the whole time not being accusatory and causing the other's defenses to slam down and to shut down communication.<br/><br/>It's like, you're not fighting. You're delicately doing surgery on each other with social scalpels, and no one wants to flinch or make a sudden move, but you generally realize that it's for the best.<br/><br/>It's like Jenga, not like RISK. <br/><br/>In situations where I seem to have a lot of leverage -- say, when I am leading employees who report to me -- I still work hard to build rapport, earn their trust, lead through example, and convince them that what we're doing is worthwhile and correct. Sometimes I have to say, "Nope. Moving on," because ultimately I have ownership they do not, but shutting them down has a cost, too.<br/><br/>In situations where I seem to have no leverage -- say, when I talk to someone on the board of the company -- I have to realize that I am valuable to them, too, and I am here because I have expertise. My expertise is social capital, so I have leverage.<br/><br/>I don't have any solutions for the game thing.

Well, no, I think you should still give it a try. The only way to learn is to practice, of course, but more importantly: the most important principle is that the entire play group agrees, "yes, this is a Minor/Medium/Major compromise." Different groups may reach different consensus on that question, but that doesn't mean one is doing it right and the other wrong.<br/><br/>Still, I'm happy to get into a bit more detail if I can do so usefully.<br/><br/>So, I like to think of a Minor Compromise as "softening the blow." It doesn't fundamentally alter that the winner won and the loser lost; the loser merely manages to extract some very small concession from the winner: an extra few days to pay the rent, as opposed to having it waived entirely, for example.<br/><br/>A Medium Compromise is "time to pay the piper." It's basically a 7-9 result for the winner. They definitely get what they want, but there is some specific, concrete thing they have to give in return OR it's limited in some specific way. The first thing might look like this: the loser goes into exile from Venice, but is provided a letter of introduction to a prominent family in Florence, for example. Whereas the second thing would have the exile lasting a fixed but lengthy period of time, such as five years.<br/><br/>A Major Compromise turns a win into a Pyrrhic victory (but still a victory). The Baron will give you the funds to build your fortress, but will staff it with his personal troops, who are either of dubious competence and/or loyal primarily to him and not you. Major Compromises can be great for "okay, dealing with the consequences from this will be the next major plot arc in the campaign."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458861/#Comment_458861" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-28T23:30:12+00:00" title="December 28, 2016 11:30PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see!
