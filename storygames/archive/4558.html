These aren't people who are miserable because they're causing their own misery.  Those people are sort of annoying.  The characters I love are morally blameless:  there is nothing more that they could be doing to better their situation.  The son who has done <i>everything</i> right but still can't please a demanding father, the geek at school who is constantly ridiculed by his peers, the captured princess held by an all-powerful wizard, that kind of thing.  People with massive sadness beyond their control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think that what I love about these characters is the suffering <i>per se</i> ... rather, I love to see the ways that they can rise above that suffering to do something important and valuable for others.  The captured princess can't <i>escape</i>, but maybe she can find a wounded knight in the enchanted forest, and keep him hidden until she can nurse him back to health.  <b>HE</b> can escape, even if she is powerless to do so.  The idea that, even though her life is really hard, the princess can have the strength to worry about others ... I find that quite powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, I can't deny that what that <i>leads me to</i> is telling stories about people who have far more suffering in their life than I do.  I've heard people talk (with contempt) about the concept of "misery tourism" ... spoiled, pampered bourgeois who have never really suffered, <i>playing</i> at hardship in order to get a <i>frisson</i> of emotion and catharsis.  That doesn't sound so nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a line there?

All stories have conflict in them, it's part of the definition. Stories exist to make statements about values (even really complex ones like "this sort of person is both horrible and yet somebody who we would otherwise admire.") To the extent that we use misery in such stories to train ourselves on how to act well, it's fine to use the misery in question as a force to move us to learn. In fact, that's why we have stories, and not just training. Who wants to really charge that hill, if they don't have to? But, if you haven't been trained to charge the hill, and trained from a moral/ethical standpoint, you probably won't charge the hill. You learn to charge the hill by watching John Wayne do it, and admiring him, whether or not he survives. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll religion is based in these sorts of stories from our holy texts. If Noah can weather 40 days and 40 nights, and still keep his faith, then we should too. If we feel his misery in reading about that, and then realize how righteous Noah is in his perseverance, and this moves us to have some fraction of Noah's strength of character, then that can't be a bad thing, can it? <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the "misery tourist" isn't really interested in learning, but is really just so bored with their life that they read Noah's story just to feel the misery, and to learn nothing from it. To the extent that a "story" has little or no value statement for the observer to consider (even possibly to reject, if they decide that they don't agree with the author), it may well be misery tourism. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'll be judgmental enough here to say that people who do this really need to examine their life more closely. As Shreyas points out, I don't think that they're hurting anyone else in most cases. But I think that they're hurting themselves. Sadness can have a purpose, but without purpose I think it's just a good road to depression. <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, Tony, your examples are showing clear signs of values - you've gone out of your way to specify this - so I don't think you should worry. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes me think of the show Six Feet Under, which is about the saddest subject of all: Death. In fact it is nothing but episode after episode of dabbling in the misery of those who have lost people in their lives. It is a courageous endeavor, to me, in that this is a subject that is never, ever approached with this much honesty. For myself, I am incredibly lucky enough to have never lost anybody that I've loved. Not one person. But having watched Six Feet Under, though obviously such an experience can never compare to the real event, I hope that when I do lose somebody, that I can experience the event with at least a little more dignity or equanimity than I would have if I had not seen the show. It has made me think about something sad that I would otherwise have shut out, and I am the better for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not you're learning, or just touring, is something that each individual is going to have to decide for themselves. And it's not really conscious much of the time, either (this is what makes it so powerful a learning tool), so discerning whether you're learning is not always easy. But if you make a conscious effort to do some evaluation of the message of the story, that's probably a good way to ensure that you're learning for certain, and not just livening things up in a sad way for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what works for me, anyhow. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. the "and helpless" part is the beginning of horror. There is something slightly horrific about the princess trapped in the tower. Horror stares straight into the eye of misery as hard as possible, and asks the hardest questions (what do you do if you have no good choice?). Horror movies that don't ask these hard questions really feel sick to me. Afficianadoes will say that these are the most "hardcore" of all, and what I think they're saying is that it's a challenge to endure them, given that they are all pain, and no gain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103415/#Comment_103415" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T08:08:11+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  8:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike:  I'm interested in where you draw the line.

"and helpless" is the beginning of pretty much every high school story (romance, comedy, etc., etc.) ever created:  People have sadness that they can't address, because there's a powerlessness to their position that comes with being young, incomplete and at the mercy of your peers.

Not in a middle class suburban kind of way (with predictable safe lives) but empty in a pathological, can't feel unless I'm cutting myself kind of way. When people have this they usually have some pretty nasty depression inside and may have borderline personality. Treatable but not fun. That emptiness is like a pain killer for an ocean of hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way I'd see them as candidates for hopeless helpless tragedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what your going after is exploring the human spirit rather than reveling in pain. The joy is in seeing how people become empowered not just watching them be tortured. To enjoy the torture is to identify with the abuser and that would be sadism. Sadism is certainly a valid position to come from (if not a socially popular one) but that is not where I see you at. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember traveling in Morrocco in 1985. The beggars on the street really were starving. Everyone was confronted with the question "How much do you give and how?" and "Is it wrong to enjoy this lovely country while people are suffering?"

I could speculate that it might have something to do with the way you restated it sounding like I'm saying that Sim players are insane or something. But that would be a minsinterpretation. Basically I have a very, very low tolerance for what constitutes a "Thematic Statement," if we want to go with that term. That is, I think that players who are playing sim are actually usually doing so with a gamism or narrativism bent, but doing so in a way that masks that bent (doing so in order to preserve what they find most important in RPGs, which is the appearance of the "reality" of the created world... perhaps immersion by some definitions). This is my version of the Beeg Horseshoe. <br>\n<br>\nAs such, even the most simmy of players are either: <br>\nA) Involved in sublimated Gamism, in which case they are learning from the misery how tough they are as tactitians. Or<br>\nB) Involved in sublimated Narrativism, in which case they are learning from the misery what each other feels in terms of values. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, I think that the "misery tourist" is probably rare, and, yes, may be at least neurotic (definitely not neccessarily psychotic). The bar is very low, in my mind. I think that most everyone who watches horror movies, or plays RPGs about sad stuff, or whatever, is actually doing it "right." The fact that you can even worry about it, to me, says that you can't possibly be one. The few that I've met would think it was odd even to consider the possibility that it was somehow internally damaging to themselves to be engaged in such activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes me recall one individual I knew who had a different, but possibly related attitude. He loves horror movies, because they make him laugh. The more horrific they are, the more the movie tries to make you feel for the character (especially if it's syrupy), the harder they make him laugh. I think for this individual that it's an overgrown defense mechanism or something. Interestingly, he claims not to know why he laughs at this stuff. But I would guess that he doesn't want to feel the horror, so instead of associating himself with the protagonists, he completely dissociates. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as Mel Brooks once said, "I get a papercut, that's tragedy, you fall down a manhole into a sewer and die, that's comedy." So in this individual's case, I think he doesn't want to learn anything "the hard way" by feeling the protagonist's plight - especially the helplessness - and so he finds these things to be comedic. The Misery Tourist doesn't want to learn anything, either, but they revel in the misery anyway, because they relish the misery itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're looking for a more stringent standard, one that says that even if I'm learning something that it's still exploitative... I dunno. Maybe. There's certainly the question of humility. If the person doing the learning isn't doing it respectfully that's potentially problematic, too. Are they really learning? Like if I think, "Gee, that stupid Princess, why doesn't she just escape herself," and that's my take-away from the example story in question, that might be problematic. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I'm genuinely learning in a humble way from the story, I think I'm pretty much beyond reproach. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example of actual play, I was at Origins last year and playing Conspiracy of Shadows with (amongst other people) Clinton. And he had his character do something so truely awful that I balked when he warned us prior to having his character do it that it was going to be vile and should not be taken to reflect on himself as something he'd condone. He probably didn't have to say that, given that we'd understand it implicitly, but it was so vile that he had to preface the act out of character, just in case. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I took it in, and saw it in the light it was intended, and most certainly "enjoyed" it not as a vicarious thing, but in the spirit of the theme we'd created which was something like "Secrets Can Destroy a Family." <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a good counter-example, consider the cases of PC/PC rape that occur in some play, those that the player of the recipient reports being incredibly bad experiences. I can hypothesize about play that I could accept where my character is raped by another, if it's in the process of making some sort of important statement. There are potentially good reasons to have such an event occur. But one can sense if it's just the other player getting their kicks off of it, and it's beyond bad taste to being what I'd call an actual assault of sorts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat might be beyond misery tourism in this case. To just reveling in causing somebody misery. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103490/#Comment_103490" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T14:00:40+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  2:00PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>No, Tony, I'm not really sure why that's troubling to you.

I'm not sure why you want to think that I'm saying you're in the group of people who I think have a problem, when I'<br/>\nm going out of my way to show just exactly why you're not in the group in question. If you're reading my other words as saying that the line is somewhere above you, then I've communicated very poorly, apparently. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly I don't give a rats ass how my "rhetoric" comes off, and never have. I bandy about weighty subjects regularly without giving a lot of consideration to the fact that I might accidentally hurt somebody's feelings. I just don't have enough time to worry. If people want to feel hurt by what I've said, they should go right ahead. I'm actually like JD in this way (more on that in a minute). <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite phrases is "Absence of Malice." <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does concern me, on the other hand, if I'm not getting my point across. But I'm not sure where the disconnect lies here. I can only say that I feel like you're taking my sentences out of context. At the risk of sounding like I'm equivocating, when I'm talking about learning, what you're talking about as far as your experiences seem to qualify eminently to me. Aesthetics, to me, is in fact all about the meaning of the material synthesizing with you in some way so that you develop positively from the exposure. Or...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I could go on and on with trying to use more of my vocabulary to explain what it is that I think that you are doing that makes the activity in question redeeming. But I think that it should suffice to say that you haven't fallen below the line where you're there just because your life is so devoid of meaning that you need the misery in question to feel something. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan we at least agree on that line? Misery Tourism may be more of a symptom of a problem, than the problem itself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, JD, the phenomenon you're citing is nothing at all like Misery Tourism... you're not comiserating with a protagonist at all, you're jeering villains. Have you read the book "Killing Monsters" by Gerard Jones (http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Monsters-Children-Make-Believe-Violence/dp/0465036961). The behavior you describe is, in fact, the flip-side of the same coin. You learn by comiserating with the protagonists, or by vilifying the villains. Anyone who says that it isn't OK to have violent fantasies isn't considering the context closely enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to add: this can get really complex, of course. Another thing you can do is to watch your protagonist suffer for his mistakes, the statement then being made about the "moral of the story" in terms of what one should or should not do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103720/#Comment_103720" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T12:44:37+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 12:44PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Well I could go on and on with trying to use more of my vocabulary to explain what it is that I think that you are doing that makes the activity in question redeeming.

Rambling like a bull session in college.<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked back up to the top message and the question: Is there a line between liking games with pain to revel in the power of the human spirit to endure and liking games in which people suffer to revel in the joy of suffering? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it kind of answers itself. Sure they are different on an internal level - but no one would see that outwardly (laughing at pain doesn't mean a person is a sadist they might just be nervous or have something else going on internally). The internal piece would get at what people wanted esthetically out of a game. I like lauding human strength and endurance. I like seeing the hero win in horror movies. On the other hand I'm not willing to condemn the person who gets sadistic or masochistic pleasure out of games. If it's between to conscenting adults and it hurts noone...etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said - I don't want to pariticipate in sadistic or masochistically driven games. That's my choice - not a judgement on good or bad. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did talk about some pretty pathological behavior above though. That being people who don't feel anything, who seek out pain in others so they can feel something - anything at all. This isn't psychosis. Erich Fromm in The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness described it as chronic depression. The person is so numb that they feel nothing. When this happens it is an illness (I'm not trying to diagnose anyone BTW). It isn't an esthetic choice like sadism or masochism (how ever unpopular those choices might be) but is a medical condition that should be treated. I think that reveling in the power of the human spirit rules out this kind of numbness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I pose the question back. Does a line saying X is right and Y is wrong change anything in you games? How would it play out in actual play?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103837/#Comment_103837" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T09:31:47+00:00" title="October 19, 2007  9:31AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>So I pose the question back.

I'm quite accustomed to going from (a) having a hazy grey set of comforts and discomforts, and not knowing quite what's going to squick me out or make me unhappy to (b) putting a label to something that matches what I feel, and thereby being able to figure out in advance whether something's going to be okay.  Labels and models can be useful that way.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree that there's a sharp dividing line like you portray between loving someone's strength as they endure, and loving their suffering.  I sort of just love the <i>character</i> as a whole, and their suffering and their strength are just two sides of the same coin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103851/#Comment_103851" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-19T10:12:28+00:00" title="October 19, 2007 10:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lables can be useful. I've spent a lot of time figuring out which body sensations correspond with which emotional lables. For instance the queesy feeling in my gut corresponds to fear. The sinking falling feeling in my chest corresponds to sadness. The hot flare to anger. And going beyond identifying it - to be able to act on those feelings immediately or soon after I feel them. I use a model of emotions that posits that emotions are all useful. They tell us something about the world we are in and that they are often innaccurate so they have to be moderated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm certain I'm reading in my own make up when I say there is a difference between reveling in the human spirit and enjoying the pain. If I were to revel in pain I know I would get depressed. while enduring suffering with a greater cause in mind makes me hopeful. Since they yield such different outcomes I see them as being different things. I few meaning as being about "What do I do when...?" It is very behavioral.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the actual play question - I pose it to myself - How would a difference or no difference between human spirit and pain affect my actual play? It would affect the kind of game I chose to play. I would opt to pass on the "Saw" movie RPG. I'd probably pick something less emotional. If I was put in a game that pushed feeling the characters pain I think I would emotionally distance myself from that. It would be like optional pain to me, I have plenty of real life pain so that's not what I want out of games. My emotional model predicts that thinking and doing certain things leads to feeling them as well. Just as thinking and feeling can lead to doing (moderated, of course, by reason). So my model and the lables I've attached to experiences do affect what and how I play.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think about the usefulness of the terms sadism and masochism to describe what a person wants out of a game?

To make it unimportant. For that to happen, someone has to feel a subject is important.<br/><br/>Rape of a young bride in your historic fiction game might be appropriate for your group, particularly if there are no women or rape victims in it and the consequences of the wedding night rape are not central to what happens in the story. It might be entirely inappropriate in a game with women and/or rape victims in it. You'd have to ask.<br/><br/>There are no rules for what is and is not trivialization.<br/><br/>Another example: You write a game wherein the characters are ghosts of Holocaust victims. In this game, you gain power and influence in the game by consuming weaker ghosts -- the more they suffered in life, the more they're worth as ghost-food. The game is not "about" the Holocaust and there is no effort to focus on the subject of genocide -- it's about eating weaker ghosts and fighting evil ghost Nazis in fluttering black cloaks and monocles that shoot ghost-rays in the world of the living. The Holocaust choice is based on a) aesthetics (because evil ghost Nazis with magical monocles are rad!) and b) the convenience of having lots of character options packed into one place. Any deeper themes than this will have to come from the players themselves, because the author has made no effort to introduce them or model them in the game physics.<br/><br/>There are, in our world, victims of genocide. There are descendents of survivors, and survivors themselves, of the Holocaust. Genocide, racism, mass murder, all if it actually happens in our world.<br/><br/>How would you feel about playing this game with a Jew? (Answer: it depends!) How would you feel about playing this game in your Jewish grandmother's house, with photos and memorabilia from that period? (Answer: it depends!) How do you think it would sell in Israel? (Maybe great among kids who want to kick Nazi ass; maybe a total PR disaster if the ghost-eating thing sees the light of day.)<br/><br/>Among some players this sort of thing would be horrific. Getting in-game bonuses for reveling in the suffering of your fellow ghosts? Suffering at the hands of Nazis?

Doesn't matter if they have the real world experience ... it's not about their authority, or any of that jazz.  The mere fact that they are offended means that the material was (ipso facto) offensive.  This makes <i>being offended</i> into a massively powerful trump card in any social situation.<br/><br/>That's a perverse incentive.  I'm not particularly fond of perverse incentives.  It's also a positive feedback loop: as more things become considered more offensive, it becomes easier and easier to view <i>yet more</i> things as offensive, because taking offense has been so wholly legitimized.  I'm not particularly fond of positive feedback loops.  I'm really, really not fond of combining the two.<br/><br/>This isn't even vaguely hypothetical.  I've seen this sort of pattern destroy real communities, both real-world and online, with alarming regularity.<br/><br/>Can there be any <i>practical</i> application of the "don't offend anyone" way of drawing the line?  I'm honestly skeptical.  I think that the mathematics of the system mean that its use, no matter how well-intentioned, tends toward a death-spiral of intolerance and censorship.<br/><br/>I want to respect people, I don't want to trivialize their experiences, but I think everyone's gotta draw that line based on their own judgment of the material and the history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104376/#Comment_104376" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T13:29:22+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  1:29PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's because "being offended" is fundamentally a <i>social</i> issue.
