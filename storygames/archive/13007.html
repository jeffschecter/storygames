With Warm and Fuzzy, you can create stories similar to those you might find in kids' books aimed at toddlers or beginning readers.<br/><br/>The mechanics are very simple.  Players pick and roll Story Blocks -customized dice with story elements on them-  and narrate short sentences including those rolled elements.  It's just about that easy.<br/><br/>The most complicated part of the game, right now, is the bit of DIY needed to create the Story Blocks - the custom dice used during play.  Though I do provide two different methods for creating them.<br/><br/>Now here's where the DIY can become worth while.  I took some inspiration from Fiasco when I designed the Story Blocks concept for Warm and Fuzzy.  The Story Blocks sets are themed and modular.  This means that you can create vastly different stories simply by using a different set of Story Blocks.  You can even create your own Story Blocks theme sets.<br/><br/>The game is still unplaytested, but I hope to remedy that personally soon; and you can help out by playing the game and posting your stories and comments about the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293241/#Comment_293241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T14:44:29+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  2:44PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those dice sound a bit like Rory's Story Cubes...<br/><a href="http://www.thecreativityhub.com/storycubes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thecreativityhub.com/storycubes/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
