I think I'm near the end of design, but there's one 'philosophical/theological' question that you guys might be able to help with.<br/><br/>In <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/category/two-games-one-name/" rel="nofollow">Hell for Leather</a>, every character gets a 'Forte', choosing from:\n<ul>\n<li>Bully</li>\n<li>Coward</li>\n<li>Liar</li>\n</ul>\nIn tangent to this, each character also gets a 'Foible'.  A player's adversary may spend points to force him to roll against this Foible.  Now here's the problem.  What are the choices?  I'm thinking of 'weaknesses' of the human condition.  Like:\n<ul>\n<li>Mercy</li>\n<li>Compassion</li>\n<li>Forgiveness</li>\n</ul>\nThese would be imposed upon the player as complications, but I'm not sure which kinds of situations would be applicable to each.  Could you help me to determine the parameters that could be applied to each of theses Foibles?  As in, when would a circumstance call for Mercy instead of Compassion?  Or even Forgiveness?  Do you have any ideas that could replace Compassion or Mercy?<br/><br/>Here's an example of the issue I'm having to get the ball rolling...(Is this actually Compassion or is it Mercy?)<br/><br/>Player: So, I'm running into the garage to steal the car.  I don't want anyone to see me, so I'm sneaking.   That uses Coward, right?<br/>Adversary: Actually... what's your Foible?<br/>Player: Compassion.<br/>Adversary:  Right (spends the points), as you're starting the car, you see a shape <b>obscuring</b> the only exit to the street.  There is a small boy holding the hand of his elder sister.  You hear shouting coming from the corridors behind you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239586/#Comment_239586" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T06:14:42+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  6:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this. It reminds me of a mechanic in The Dying Earth RPG, in which you can be tempted by things. In The Dying Earth, they are things like gluttony and debauchery, but you're tempting the character with human situations.<br/><br/>I can't see many situations where forgiveness will be an issue. That suggests a backstory, in which one of your pursuers has harmed you and...you...forgive him? I can't see it.<br/><br/>Compassion is <i>great</i>. That situation you've outlined sounds like a perfect compassion scene.<br/><br/>I think Mercy should be, very specifically, the inability to go in for the kill. For example:<br/><br/><i>Player: So, I hit him over the head.<br/>Adversary: Actually... what's your Foible?<br/>Player: Mercy:<br/>Adversary: Right (spends the points), so he's on the floor and he looks up at you. You're going to have to kill him, otherwise he'll tell someone where you went. But you're not sure you can bring yourself to do it.</i><br/><br/>Something like that?<br/><br/>I'm looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_virtues" rel="nofollow">Seven deadly virtues</a> and vices for inspiration for other Foibles. I wonder about Justice (you see your pursuers doing something despicable, and you know you should intervene, but it would get you caught), Sloth (you want to run but you desperately want to rest) and Pride (you can't bring yourself to crawl through the sewer).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239598/#Comment_239598" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-29T07:20:00+00:00" title="October 29, 2009  7:20AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Compassion and that narrow definition of Mercy are both good.

Great-great-great.  That's the sort of help I was looking for.<br/><br/>The more thinking I've been thinking, and the more talking that I've been talking, the more I've realised that 'mercy' is kind of the 'act of compassion', so I reckon I'll need to take one of this pair out of the equation.  I may end up only using two Foibles.  Or maybe I'll take out the Foible as a <i>character concept</i> and put it into the rules as a <i>game concept</i> - and call it a 'dilemma' or something.  At any time the Adversary could force a moral dilemma into a conflict by spending some points, which then forces the player to roll with a significantly higher risk of failure.<br/><br/>To counter the dilemma, the player can commit a 'Felony' to increase his chance of success, but these Felonies add up like a guilt track, and will doom him later in the game.<br/><br/>Blabidy-blah-blah.<br/><br/>Any more ideas how Hope or Mercy/Compassion could be interpreted as complications?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
