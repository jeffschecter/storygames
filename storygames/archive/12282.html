The rules are pretty light, but the majority of the book is taken up with advice for getting the most out of them for different types of horror and monsters.<br/><br/>The print and PDF versions are both available <a href="http://steampowerpublishing.com/shop-2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, although at the moment the print version is only available in \xa3.

I had been looking for a long time for a good, quick horror game. Call of Cthulhu had been one of my favorites, but it was tough to make one-shots, and there were always certain expectations for how the adventures would run. When Arkham Horror was released, it whetted my desire for a simpler horror game, and I ended up throwing away easily $200 or so on crap that promised to make horror easier and just as thrilling ("Slasher Flick" and "Director's Cut," I'm looking at you with daggers in the eyes...)<br/>I finished reading the rest of Dead of Night last night, and it is the best I've seen. The mechanics of the system are simple and flexible, the character creation is quick and easy. I love it. I want to play it.

But, as with first edition, the rules section is only a fraction of the book. The big changes are the addition of a whole chapter on Genre, with advice and guidance for running the game in all manner of types of horror (from splatter to psychological) and a huge new Monster chapter, with guidelines for building your own monsters. There's a new GM section too, and 4 new scenarios (including one by Scott Dorward, and another by James Mullen).<br/><br/>The size issue was the one thing that caused me the most angst. I liked it cos it was cute before, and that garnered a lot of attention, but it wasn't the most practical book to use and had a tendency to vanish on retailers' (and gamers') bookshelves. On a purely practical level, if I'd made the new edition pocket sized, it'd be almost a cube and be even less practical to use! I'm sure some people will hate the fact it's now digest, but I think it's a strong enough game to stand apart from the gimmick of its size.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snikle" title="snikle"><img alt="snikle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snikle">snikle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276361/#Comment_276361" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T10:16:12+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 10:16AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks very interesting.

The person claiming initiative or the person rolling the dice?

The Laurie example on p.32 threw me, cause it seems like the vampire has claimed initiative but (because the GM rolled previously), Laurie's player rolls even though initiative still rest with the vampire. <br/><br/>I think I get it now: in any other circumstance, the vampire would claim first initiative automatically, since he's a monster. However, because the GM rolled previously, this rule is overturned and Laurie gets to claim the initiative, choose an action, and roll the dice.

Players normally have initiative because the GM doesn't have anybody who'd roll the dice - because only monsters and PCs roll dice, generally speaking. Therefore the rule that the PC generally has initiative is not so much a rule on its own as an observation: it will usually be a player initiating an action, and therefore the player will take the dice and roll. This is only overturned when a monster comes in, as monsters tend to be proactive in ways similar to PCs. So in practice there's not much point to worrying about that rule, as it rarely comes up.<br/><br/>I also understand the initiative-swapping to only apply within the scene. Once a new situation starts we don't try to remember who rolled last in the past, but rather start anew from an empty table.<br/><br/>What this boils down to when I play is a sort of reaction-based initiative system: whoever has an idea and declares action gets to pick up the dice and roll them. Initiative is literally initiative, which I like for how jumpy it makes the players as they hasten to act before hostile forces do; this probably originated in the idea that the only way for the player to take the initiative against a monster would be to act before the monster "appears", which ultimately boils down to the same idea that whoever makes up their mind and speaks up first gets to go. The swapping rule is still in effect, though - if you were the last to act, you can't grab the dice again before somebody else does.<br/><br/>Also, the most basic difference in who has the initiative: if the monster has the initiative, your next roll will likely be to find out whether it rips your arm off or not. If you have the initiative, your next roll is likely to be about whether you can escape from the situation or not.

I've not read through it yet I've been re-aquainting myself with the 1st edition for a game night coming up, been over a year since I ran a game (due to moving and loosing my old copy of 1st ed) but it is one of those RPG's that when you go through it you soon pick it up again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got the 2nd ed. (I've been looking forward to this since Andrew first mentioned it) in the post and opened the parcel you can just see sheer quality oozing from this book.  For some reason I had got it into my head it was going to be A4 size but although it's not pocket size like the 1st ed., it's still I think a nice handy size.  The art is fantastic, the actual layout and how everything is set out makes a bit more sense than in the 1st ed, and therefore easier to find certain information.  I know I said I've not read it yet but it's sitting next to my computer so every time I should be getting work finished I keep picking it up and flicking through.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso some excellent little extras in the parcel including some lovely card characters sheets with the book cover printed on the other side (Andrew - I hope we will be able to order some of these if we wanted more?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I've had a proper read and gone through and got an evening or two gaming done I shall get a proper review together, I'm just so excited, and just wish I didn't have so much time taken up at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277229/#Comment_277229" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T04:56:47+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  4:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero has it pretty much right Adrian - unless the players are quick, the GM is going to leap in and have the monster eat them.

So prep-time was short. Two players expressed strong wish not to use lonely-cabin setting. Which was my initial idea. So instead I went for a grand old hospital as playground.<br/><br/>I used the hospital scenario as inspiration. The premise was that the hospital was expanding its basement. And accidentally dug into a Aztec prison-pit holding a hungry soul eating demon. The constructors become the first victims and are left as dried out empty husks. Then there is a city wide power outage as the urban power grid mysteriously fails. The hospital is running on backup generators. Leaving a lot of its many wings left in dark. The players would play random people in the hospital with various inclinations to investigate the murders as the first bodies in the O.R. were discovered.<br/><br/>We used Monster Movie'ish setup, with a Hunter styled stalking soul eater. Hiding its movement by shorting out electric units and blacking out rooms and corridors. I set the monsters tokens to 6, can't recall its monstrous specializations (hardly got to use them), set initial Tension to 5, and limited Tension spends to assault and escape checks.<br/><br/>I put 20 tokens in the SP-bag. 5 of them green. The rest red. All players started with 4 red tokens. When players earned SPs the would draw from the bag. Any players with only green tokens at any point would be subject to a control attack, to reflect the curse of the demon. Any players ending the game with green in the pool would have to narrate a prologue-shot expressing how the curse affected this particular person after the incident.<br/><br/>The cast included:<br/>- A lawyer, there as a patient from a car crash, whose buddy is one of the first victims.<br/>- An ex-cop working as security in the hospital with occasional outbursts of violence.<br/>- A doctor. McDreamy'ish. Slept with a host of nurses. Despised and loved equally.<br/>- A homeless addict hallucinating crazy (and sometimes true) premonitions.<br/><br/>After a bit of fumbling on my part with the opening scene, the game progressed rather smoothly. Tension increased as players spent their tokens and so on. I made the mistake of reducing starting tokens to 4 instead of 5. Which slowed the tension build-up a bit and made the players a bit more restrictive in their spendings. Otherwise we had several really good horror-scenes.<br/><br/>The game came to a climax in the E.R. which is flooded with victims caused by the city wide power outage. The monster face McDreamy, the only player left with tokens. The player spends them wisely and manages to ram a shotgun up its chin, muttering something along the lines of "Why don't you crawl back to the fucking pit you came from" before pulling the trigger and ending the movie.<br/><br/>Set to Wolfmothers tune Pyramid we collectively narrated a montage of scenes displaying the characters post-climax. The two players with greens in the pools added nice colour by adding scenes were their characters attains characteristics of the monster. Ending the story with the ex-cop, with demonesque eyes, calling the hospital announcing his return to active duty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285092/#Comment_285092" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T04:11:45+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  4:11AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a great game!

The players immediately sensed that they were alien bodies in the red pool of goodness. Some players were afraid to use them. And others were afraid not to use them. Created great extra tension around the table. But I suppose the effect will be gone if used too often. The fear of the unknown will only last so long.<br/><br/>The problem I had with Tension was just always considering it when setting the scene, and tracking it actively. I often forgot to add player spends to the pool. It meant I would sometimes think "whops.. that was a 10+ scene, and I played it as a 5+ instead". I suppose as I warm to the system it'll run smoother. Just a matter of getting used to it. <br/><br/>On establishing the gravity of the situation. I often forgot to tell players that the test they were attempting were Risk Tests. We made an on-the-fly ritual of me always announcing the type of test before setting it up. That worked fine for the situation at hand. But I'd like to come up with a more elegant handle on this.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the players loved the char-gen. Fast. Easy. Evocative. And the system was easy to learn. We spent perhaps half a day browsing the book before setting up the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward" title="Scott Dorward"><img alt="Scott Dorward" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott%20Dorward">Scott Dorward</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285224/#Comment_285224" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:14:13+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like fantastic session all round.
