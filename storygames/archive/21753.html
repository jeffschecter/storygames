                    I was wondering about what kind of rules you all have in mind when handling NPCs and monsters. I mean, there's the simple stuff like keeping in mind the character's goal and modify the character's actions accordingly. But what if the character is more or less competent?<br/><br/>The first time I ran the Lost Mines of Phandelver, I felt the first encounter goblins were so fragile that I tried to adapt their strategy instead of changing their stats, in fear of breaking something. It turned out giving them a bit of strategy actually broke things a bit.<br/><br/>Goblins can use their bonus action to try to hide after making an attack, so I added a few bushes on the map to give them places to hide. PCs could still attack through the bushes as they gave no actual cover, they could even pass through them as difficult terrain. It made sense, it wasn't like the goblins trapped the whole place nor anything.<br/><br/>The goblins rolled a 20 for their stealth at the beggining of the encounter and for the next two rounds they fired arrows at the party without losing their stealth. They even flanked them and made the players think for another turn that there were less enemies than there actually was.<br/><br/>At the end of that encounter, two level 1 PCs from a party of 5 were inconscious and one goblin almost had escaped. The players got a bit more scared of goblins so when they found out the goblin den they ended up running away when the flood pushed them out of the cave.<br/><br/>Later I went over at what had happened and I still think that despite some bad player's luck those slight changes at the enemy A.I. were important, as they should obey to actually how smart or experienced the opponents are. For example:<br/><br/>-Don't underestimate their enemy<br/>-Are aware of their own weak points and prepare accordingly<br/>-Target the major threat first<br/>-Surprise their opponents whenever they can<br/>-Distract their opponents before making a move<br/>-Surround their oponents before attacking<br/>-Look out for the enemy's weak points<br/>-Investigate the enemy capabilities before the actual combat<br/>-Retreat before they get too many loses<br/>-Look out for favorable terrain / Prepare it before the battle<br/>-Target the enemy supplies and run<br/>-Get their hands on something to negotiate before the encounter<br/><br/>All these end up making this or the next encounter more difficult. Opposite behaviors end up making the current or next encounter more difficult. I'm wondering if a better list could be made to use matching the enemy A.I. or say, INT level. What do you think?                </div>

                            I think that it could be an important factor in a combat heavy game. You are right about INT having a huge factor, but also leadership and experience of fighting in formations could count. Do you think it worths to create a complex system for that?                        </div>

                            Just spitballing here, but possibly a "combat style" table might be a nice way of managing strategies?  For example, along the top, you have "Bloodthirsty", "Cunning", "Cowardly", et cetera, and then you get various interpretations of what those traits mean, from which you select using INT.  For example:
<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Bloodthirsty</th><th>Cowardly</th></tr>
<tr><th>Low INT</th><td>Charges at random</td><td>Hides whenever possible</td></tr>
<tr><th>Medium INT</th><td>Basic flanking</td><td>Steals supplies and runs</td></tr>
<tr><th>High INT</th><td>Nasty traps</td><td>Prepares cover beforehand</td></tr></table>
Just a thought.  (Interesting to see that I naturally associate "high INT" with "being prepared".  I was a Scout when I was younger...)                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">@hamnacb</a> well, it doesn't have to be a complex system if it mostly provides answers directly instead of trying to simulate how an opponent would think. <a href="/forums/profile/13Clocks">@13Clocks</a> has it right. Most of the times the GM just needs to know how would X monster use the attacks ah their dispossal. It's been somewhat discussed already on the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21722/who-does-the-monsters-attack#latest" rel="nofollow">'Who does the monsters attack'</a> thread but the focus there is different and the discussion there is done, so I thought of starting another thread instead.<br/><br/>An intelligent monster shouldn't reverse engineer the system math and realize the best strategy is to focus on a single PC until it's dead and then go to the next. It should react in a more natural way instead and have an array of different strategies at their dispossal. There can be some degree of instinct-based reactions mixed with those and everything could be influenced by the current state of the creature resources and maybe emotional state.<br/><br/>The approach I tried so far was to check the monster stats and features first. These were my notes when I was running a 5e campaign:<br/><br/><b>IS IT STRONG/BIG?</b><br/>-Prefers melee attacks, makes more damage using heavy weapons or throwing them<br/>-Uses heavy armour<br/>-Can move or destroy obstacles and cover<br/>-May charge/trample over opponents<br/>-Grapples, hard to escape from it<br/>-May jump, climb and swim quite well<br/>-May carry additional equipment or another creature<br/>-May Rage and get even stronger <br/><br/>Usually uses an aggresive direct approach to problem solving, may target anything but would probably try to measure their strength against an equal or settle down to having fun with weaker creatures.<br/><br/><b>IS IT DEXTEROUS/FAST?</b><br/>-Will try to go first as much as possible<br/>-Prefers hit and run tactics, probably using ranged and/or precise attacks<br/>-Stealthy, ambusher, will use cover and try to obscure <br/>-May try to approach their target from unexpected directions.<br/>-Flees whenever it can using any special movement at their dispossal<br/>-Will often carry a ligth load and even ditch armor<br/><br/>Tends to favour patience until it can strike and then do it first, faster and as precisely as it can, to bring down opponents quickly. Will either try to do the most damage or slow down their opponents by targeting their movement options.<br/><br/><b>IS IT RESISTANT?</b><br/>-Either by being inmune to certain attacks or able to soak tons of damage it will often straight engage oponents without caring for cover and intimidating them with their resistance if possible.<br/><br/><b>IS IT INTELLIGENT?</b><br/>-Relies in numbers<br/>-Will be more cautious<br/>-Will retreat/flee if it loses half their resources or sees no gain. (except for mindless or fanatic opponents)<br/>-Will use tools, choose a favorable terrain (cover, obstacles, visibility, something to slow down, gather or divide their enemies according to their tactics, resources and other abilities)<br/>-Will prepare tools and terrain beforehand, may use traps.<br/>-Uses allies to provide whatever it lacks, supports them using their own abilities<br/>-May trick their opponents to think they are stronger and lead them to a trap.<br/>-May trick their opponents to think they are weaker and make them run or stay wherever they are.<br/>-Curious: May try to gather information about their opponents and prep against their strengths, gain advantage from their weakness or plain try to understand their motivations/nature.<br/><br/>Tends to favour patience, chose their battles and take risks only when there's something to gain. Will target whatever considers the biggest threat but will change priorities as needed instead of focusing on it. May want to measure their intelect against an equal by targeting their resources instead. (except for mindless or fanatic opponents)<br/><br/><b>IS IT PERCEPTIVE?</b><br/>-Will use ranged attacks if possible<br/>-Will track and try to find their opponents before it's found, and attack first.<br/>-Will be alert against ambushed/stealthy opponents and flee if battle is unfavourable at the  moment.<br/><br/>May target leaders first, opponents that use range or look fast enough to catch them.<br/><br/><b>IS IT CHARISMATIC?</b><br/>-Will rely on allies<br/>-Will often try an indirect approach, talk down and trick their opponents<br/>-May try to turn opponents against each other<br/><br/>Will target the opponent most suceptible to manipulation<br/> </div>

                            I like using the typical army behavior from the solo DBA war game community. <br/><br/><a href="https://solowargamer.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/typical-army-behaviours/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://solowargamer.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/typical-army-behaviours/</a><br/><br/>It's stuff like this (swiped from the blog)<br/><br/>Dwarves: Typical Army Behaviour<br/><br/>Blades will form up wherever possible in single line as the main battle formation, with the General towards the centre (either in the front rank or to the rear). A single Blade unit may be detached to protect the Stronghold, where relevant.<br/><br/>Blades may fight in bad going but will avoid doing so against Warbands (who quick-kill Blades in HoTT).<br/><br/>Shooters will generally be placed on the flanks, often to cover or advance through bad going. If facing an enemy with significant mounted units, the Shooters may instead mingle with the Blades.<br/><br/>The Behemoth will be placed either in the centre of the Blade line near the General, or towards a flank – where its own flank can be covered by a Shooter unit.<br/><br/>Dwarves favour a steady, coordinated advance. They will tend to focus on maintaining the cohesion of their main battle line until they have succeeded in breaking the enemy formation by sheer muscle and persistence. If their line is fractured they will hold position and regroup rather than plow on regardless.<br/><br/>Dwarven Generals may be cautious or steady, but will very rarely be impetuous. They will favour open battlefields with a minimum of bad going, unless facing a primarily mounted opponent. They may choose to place impassable terrain to maximise the effectiveness of their heavy troops and minimise the risk of being outflanked.                        </div>

                            Nice work everyone! Of course, there can't be a single way of doing this, as each one appeals to a different playstyle and atmosphere, but it should be a key part of any ruleset. <br/><br/>Power fantasy may have monsters tank more and give them a few special attacks to spice up the combat, gritty OSR would be perhaps the opposite. But otherwise in both cases and other styles, the GM needs to make use of the whole combat system: make the monsters move, change targets, put obstacles and make terrain difficult, work with the visibility and have the enemies make use of all this, while giving the players the chance to do the same. <br/><br/>Certainly a guide to do this properly without falling into unfairness should be a must for any system. Not that GMs can't learn to do this by their own or understand how just by looking at the combat system rules and monster specs, but at least hinting that there's a method to this may save lots of GMs from running boring combats until they see them at the table and dare ask on the internet what are they doing wrong, or plain reinvent the wheel.                        </div>
