K. Chesterton's <i>Napoleon of Notting Hill</i> and players who insist that, "everything that could be done in wargaming has been done already," I've decided to try designing a wargame that emphasizes story play. Like the book, the game is set in a city in which the various neighbourhoods have gone to war.<br/><br/>Thus far:<br/>- I'm planning on using fantasy armies because they've got a lot of special pieces (leaders, heroes, monsters, etc.).<br/>- I've built a set of fantasy wargame rules that run very smoothly and quickly without feeling like sudden death<br/>- a campaign involves playing 3-4 battles, roughly an hour apeice, each battle taking place at a different "territory" (scenario) within each player's neighbourhood, and an over-arching plot emerging over several games<br/>- the scale of the game will usually involve 10-25 pieces per side<br/>- the emphasis during play is more on controlling initiative and morale than on causing large numbers of casualties.<br/>- every army will have one piece chosen to be the hero around which the story revolves.<br/>- the goal of each game is not to demolish the opponent's forces, but to complete a "story" that will earn the hero a reputation<br/><br/>Where I'm struggling a bit is with building the story elements into the mechanics. Initially I thought of doing it with cards of special actions, but now I'm thinking a roleplaying/story game mechanic might be more in line with what I really need. Certainly special actions should be accompanied by description from the players. The mechanic could be very open, and should be able to override the wargame mechanics, at least when it comes to keeping the heroes alive, though not necessarily granting the heroes the ability to defeat everything else.<br/><br/>Heroes likely have some sort of motivations or other characteristic. Some motivations might be individual, others would be the "civic pride" of the neighbourhood or represent the archetype of the hero's race.<br/><br/>Does anyone have suggestions as to story games I might look to for inspiration?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191514/#Comment_191514" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T19:25:02+00:00" title="February  7, 2009  7:25PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calling Komradebob...calling Komradebob...your thread is here...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191515/#Comment_191515" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T19:49:51+00:00" title="February  7, 2009  7:49PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2009 8:39PM by ccreitz.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cautionary tale: Battletech / Mechwarrior.

I could totally see a "story wargame" where the scenario takes the form of a list of one-time keys like that, and you slide along the list, achieving victory by (weighted?) progress along your faction's list.  Each time you check off one of your objectives \u2014 which are cleverly engineered to bring about story crises, say \u2014 some mechanical advantage accrues to your side.<br/><br/>Problems - maintaining player authorship?  Maybe instead of a list, there's a pool.  You take a card which has a thing you want to do.  Maybe an effect of achieving a card allows you to add a new card or card at a low value, or increase the value of an existing one.  Maybe you get to shop for the advantage from a menu?  So many points to cause a one-unit faction dispute (presumably against your opponent), so many to allow you bring in your "My destiny is to bring honor to my common family's name" trait over in square H14, so many to excise a "Fearless, even when faced with ghosts" trait from another character?<br/><br/>For those of us playing along at home, would it be OK to predicate some ideas on having a GM?  It isn't traditional in war games, as far as I can tell, but in story games it's widespread and allows for the use of certain battle-tested techniques for conflict generation.<br/><br/>This does seem like a cool and interesting problem.  I didn't mean to sound so pessimistic \u2014 I am hardened by my own disappointment, but I can see why this looks like a mountain you might want to climb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191522/#Comment_191522" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-07T22:11:20+00:00" title="February  7, 2009 10:11PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just saying it before someone else does: Have you considered just doing the melodrama freeform?

The particular form it ended up taking had a bunch to do with the fact that my test subject was my daughter who was about 8 or 9 at that point, wasn't particularly more interested in the combat-y parts more than other things, and who was pretty content with a practical system I could describe as:<br/><br/>A period of free-play build-up to a tension point<br/>Negotiate to two outcomes of that tension point<br/>Flip coin to pick one outcome<br/>Enter result as true in on-going story events<br/>Return to a period of free play,as above.<br/><br/>Play until Dad was creatively exhausted ( she never became creatively exhausted!).<br/>_____<br/><br/>In general terms, this kind of play has been explored before, but isn't much known, even in wargaming circles. Names you'll want to look for are Chris Engles ( Matrix Games), Howard Whitehouse ( a variety of small, independant miniatures games), and Paddy Griffith ( Mugger Games). Wargames Development Handbook, mentioned by Tom R is a good starting point.<br/><br/>One key difference that I'd note about all of those games ( and variants of them) is that each has a GM-type position that covers two primary things: A Situation Starter and a Probability Detereminer.<br/><br/>Because you are discussing the use of minis in play, you may not be able to get around the Situation Starter position being necessary. This tends to be for the very simple reason that genereally, the most excited participant, the general initiator, also likely owns the bulk of the collection of minis and terrain that will be used. This doesn't have to absolutely be the case, and I have some old rough drafts of essays I wrote over at Levi's old site about collecting minis as a group as a form of general "content" or "flags" to draw from.<br/><br/>The probablity determiner part Chris Engle actually has covered in his own writings, and I've played one No-Gm minis game with Elliot W ( also a site memeber here) using the Mythic GM Emulator that I was pretty pleased with, even despite the fact that I was tending to make my decisions of probablity based on genre-convention, while Elliot tends to be more of a fan of small-S simulation based decision making.<br/>____<br/><br/>Also, FWIW, my long post in Jason Hyperkeys thread ( the on that ccreitz links above) was based off stuff I've puttered around with for pretty much the same kind of thing you're talking about doing in this thread.<br/>____<br/><br/>The biggest problem I think you'll face in building something like this is just how split in the hobby between folks that prefer no physical representations and a less obvious Win/EndGame style of play and the folks that are very much the competitive grognard minis wargamer end of the hobby. This sort of game basically plays hell with some cherished traditions of play of either school of thinking, so the result tends to be either strong "push-back" or demoralising indifference (Paddy Griffith's games got their "Mugger Game" name from disappointed wargamers at conventions, for example).<br/><br/>From what I can tell, playing something like this successfully is less about talented mechanical construction, and vastly more about the social talent of finding and recruiting like-minded players willing to play this general style while understanding that you'll only later formalize and codify processes that work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191543/#Comment_191543" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T09:13:09+00:00" title="February  8, 2009  9:13AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some general thoughts:<br/>1) Grab lots of index cards and just plain brainstorm everything you can about the situation/setting/characters/events ( large and small or tactical).<br/><br/>Do it until your brain collapses, go get some tea and a nap, then do some more.

What you do with those cards is up to you, but they're a clear set ofmarkers for the content you're interested in. You could very easily deal out stuff like this to players before the game. It should be vastly easier than making them read a rule book.<br/><br/>2) Don't be afraid to run some demo stuff and explain exactly how the system works, even if the "system" is essentially the GM determinign  probability ( in which case, you should explain how you arrived at that probability).<br/><br/>3) Comedy is an important tool for reaching drama<br/>IME, folks, when dealing with a style of play with an ability for players to enter a bunch of content, really benefit from having a chance to roll out a bunch of crazy comedic stuff on the first outting. I think Ralph Mazza has mentioned that this is common with new Universalis players. So run with it. Let them. Encourage it. Set them up for it- Give them a Harry Flashman or a C3PO, or some other sort of bumbling oaf or rascal to play up. People seem generally more willing to experiment with those than the more "serious" events, like combat resolution in a minis game.<br/><br/>4) Experiment with simply changing the win conditions<br/><br/>This is one that I haven't been able to enact myself, but I've seen it in both presentation minis games at conventions and in a LARP I played in: Basically,the winner or MVP is determined by group vote/acclaim after the game is over. In both cases I'm thinking of that I experienced, this was an unannounced post-game event. You might consider how this could be used as an announced part of play at the beginning.<br/><br/>One thing I'd hope it might change is that it would allow players to think more about their actions in context of group-play,as opposed to their own faction. A lot of this will be driven by group feeling after play. A group that appreciates tactical play and small-s simulation may well pick a winner who aided that, regardless of whether they "won" on the battlefield at all. Other groups may well choose for their own peculiar reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191544/#Comment_191544" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T09:30:10+00:00" title="February  8, 2009  9:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played Games Workshop's  Necromunda?

They describe exceedingly cool battles and passionate characters, but when you play the wargame, you roll 2 dice versus target number 4 and...there's the disappointment expressed by the term "heartbreaker" in the gaming hobby. I want to close that gap a bit, to give the players more of what these sorts of games offer in their writeups but fail to deliver in play. I think story games may have the key to doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191551/#Comment_191551" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T10:46:22+00:00" title="February  8, 2009 10:46AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh- sorry about the overwhelming wall of text, madunkieg!<br/><br/>The trick is to get people to the point where they can apply S-G style outcome creation and content creation to a minis game, and get them to recognize that different kinds of stuff can work on a similar resolution system.<br/><br/>One jump that seems to be tricky is "scaling of events", and I guess I'd relate that to the Bringing Down the Pain concept from Shadows of Yesterday. Minis games tend to have a consistent scale of events, and usually a fairly involved one. This isn't actually all that necessary for an S-G-ified minis wargame.<br/><br/>For example, some things that tend to be pretty involved in a standard sort of minis game can be resolved relatively easily when S-G-ified. A broad, sweeping manuever by a section of force? Say Yes or roll some dice if there's a diferent ( probably interfering) idea by another player that would change or modify that maneuver. ONe or two rolls and the thing is done.<br/><br/>OTOH, to get the drama, we start to add equal weight in resolution to the dramatic stuff.<br/><br/>Mjr Hawthorn's square is being menaced by Martian rebels, but now enemy cavalry has broken off and headed for the Consulate building where his lady-love is barricaded in? Okay, now we want to go a bit slower, and have some more rolls, probably, to up the tension. we also likely want to give equa weight in some way to Mjr Hawthorn's efforts based on the more character related dramatic stuff than just how accurate a shot he is or how fast he is on his feet.<br/><br/>The other thing that comes up is the actual physical scale of the table-top set up. Again, we can go with drama as opposed to physical accuracy of scale. Range is as simple as They couldn't hit the broadside of a barn from there/getting closer/OMG! I can see the whites of their eyes!/ All up in your face. Similarly, movement can work this way.<br/><br/>And what those things will mean is entirely dependant upon the interests of the actual players at a given moment. That flexible scale works as easily on a 2' x 2' card table as a full on 40K table at the flgs. And, honestly, you can be flexible as the game is being played, provided that players are made aware of <i>relative</i> distance/scale.<br/><br/>(And you can physically manipulate the pieces easily. A cantina where an important shoot-out is going to take place may have a physical footprint similar IRL tabletop terms to a valley that a column has to push through while being menaced from the heights by skirmishers).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191610/#Comment_191610" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T23:34:30+00:00" title="February  8, 2009 11:34PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any constructive ideas to add, other than that I loved The Napoleon of Notting Hill, and that any game that takes inspiration from it has me hooked in big-time.
