That's really what it's about. <br/><br/>There will always be some level of illusionism, because in giving the players freedom they'll go where you don't expect, so you have to just make shit up (NPCs, locations, etc.). You try to do this as "neutrally" as possible by thinking to yourself, "Okay, in this game world, what <i>would</i> happen? What <i>would</i> be here?" Not what would be "fun", not what would be a challenge, not what would kill your players, not what would make a good story... but what <i>would</i> happen.<br/><br/>Random generators help a lot to keep you honest.

If he generates adventure hooks for them, is he really neutral or is he doing illusionism?</blockquote>\nJean's explanation accords with my own experiences. The GM neutrality is maintained by personal hygiene of thought: you need to feel the neutrality. It's easy to recognize whether you're being neutral yourself when you are; it's sort of like the part of your brain that commits planning is shut down. This is why I might seem even a bit obsessive about dicing procedure while playing, I'm intentionally ignoring my capability for merely deciding things. Is the moon out tonight? How many bandits there are? Does the chief bandit speak French? Will they fall for bluster? All things are determined either effortlessly by querying the fiction (that is, what I see in my mind) or by the dice, with external concerns about play experience never intruding. I decide nothing, and in this zen-like state of non-decision it is really easy for me to recognize any spark of decision-making that would break my calm, and I can thus move to correct. This would be much more difficult if I had to make partially illusionistic decisions, as then I'd have to both recognize the stillness of mind and break it at the same time.<br/><br/>That was clear as mud, I'm sure, but I think it describes the feeling of neutrality well. It's a state of mind you achieve by letting go of responsibility. This is why I don't think that "GM is responsible for fun" and "GM is a neutral arbiter" are truly compatible atttitudes: you can have one of those, but trying for both at the same time is impossible because you lose the calm ability to query the fiction without prejudice if you feel responsibility for the outcomes.<br/><br/>Of course, the responsibility for <i>content</i> is the big, fat challenge here. This responsibility is the responsibility of constructive imagination: it is not sufficient for you to imagine the game world, but you need to also imagine it as a content-ful place, all without also imagining meanings and outcomes. Striving for content without constructing meaning in advance is a challenge, and probably why I'm endlessly fascinated by random encounter tables, ready-made encounters and everything else that ensures that when the time comes to provide content, my content will be neutral. (Interestingly the content is neutral in this psychological hygiene sense as long as you introduce it randomly or without intent or because it logically follows; somebody might have pre-designed the material you run with intent, but you'll be able to work it intent-less yourself if you commit to the content in a neutral time and place.)<br/><br/>Most of play time is spent after content is committed to, though, so most of the time it is easy to be neutral and calm. I could only imagine that this would be difficult if a GM had discordant thoughts about his responsibilities: believe in your non-responsibility, and the inner calm will follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371265/#Comment_371265" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T16:24:11+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  4:24PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2012 4:25PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite><b>Eero</b>, what do you think about sandbox gaming?

It's not necessary to preplan everything, you just need to introduce enough random error that your mind breaks free from structure. For example, if it occurs to me that a e.g. dragon might well live among the peaks of this specific mountain hex, because I remember some rumour to that effect from earlier, I do not immediately conclude that this must be so. Instead, I roll 50/50 for permission to myself to introduce the dragon. (Otherwise I would conclude that the rumour was false, simply enough.) I train myself to take content commitments through these types of hurdles so that whatever I ultimately end up introducing is effectively randomly selected, even if the selection is out of a set of self-invented ideas.<br/><br/>The sandbox is, of course, not true simulation of the world. Specifically, the GM will and should allow real-world pacing to influence himself. The game is simply more enjoyable if you e.g. decide to skip the random encounters at the end of a session so you'll still have 15 minutes to divide the treasure and do maintenance before the session ends. This type of real-world pacing means that you introduce and commit to content at the beginning of sessions, and close issues and ignore opportunities to introduce content towards the end. It's a natural cycle of play, and a clear example of how the sandbox is not "perfect" even if it does exist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371266/#Comment_371266" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T16:31:33+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  4:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2012 4:35PM by ivan.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eero, I always enjoy reading your posts.<br/><br/>I believe this is the first time I see the GM internal state of equanimity being explicitly reified to a compass for correct gaming procedures. This is very interesting.<br/><br/>In terms of content.. you can't of course know everything in advance. If a random encounter generates a band of adventurers, how do you know their intent and attitude towards the characters? Do you make up plausible outcomes and roll?

That's the big one.<br/><br/>As for why it's not "old school", that probably depends on what you think that term means. As I said in the other thread, I don't use that term because I don't quite understand it. If I had to use it, I'd use it to reference the '70s rpg scene in general. In this sense Apocalypse World is not old school because it was published thirty years too late.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371374/#Comment_371374" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T07:16:36+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  7:16AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2012 7:22AM by J_Walton.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>What in Apocalypse World makes it not part of the OSR?</blockquote>\nOh man, that's a whole 'nother conversation.<br/><br/>Short version: in my mind, AW and its kin are heavily inspired by "Second Wave" sandbox games like Shadowrun, Vampire, Ars Magicka, etc. They have exception-based designs where the characters start out as minor badasses and all have unique and different powers. The group does "play to find out what happens" but the GM is explicitly supposed to be a fan of the characters and make moves that allows them to show off who they are. Relationship maps are super important, as the character are closely connected with other factions and NPC personalities.<br/><br/>In comparison, the OSR is heavily inspired by pre-1985 RPG texts that are much more closely descended from the wargaming roots of RPGs. The PCs do not start out as important or potent at all. Indeed, they die like flies until you find some that manage to survive. The rules are not exception-based, but treat everyone more or less the same, varying based on your stats and gear more than individual class-based powers. Wizards are a bit different I guess, but even then spells are more like things they have than things that they are. The GM is supposed to govern the game impartially, not being a fan of anyone (PCs, NPCs, or monsters). Relationships between characters and NPCs are purely fluff, for the most part, and are not at all the main driver of play. The "play to find out what happens" isn't to find out what type of people the characters are and what choices they make or where the story will go, but much more literally "when we go down this corridor, what happens?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371383/#Comment_371383" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T08:02:29+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  8:02AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

My sense is also that AD&amp;D2 and 3E/Pathfinder and Warhammer Fantasy 2nd are closer to "Second Wave" in their approach to sandbox play (hard to imagine mapping and calling there, though you could do it in DW/AD&amp;D/Palladium, probably), while 4E is this crazy thing where you're badasses but confined to a flowchart or railroad of pre-planned and perfectly balanced encounters (without either the merciless neutrality of the OSR or the open-ended, character-based play of Second Wave stuff). It would be really interesting to talk about how 4E is situated in relation to OSR-style play and the Second Wave, actually, but that's probably another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371410/#Comment_371410" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T09:53:34+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  9:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apropos of nothing: I wonder how it is that "mechanic" snuck into the gamer lexicon where "mechanism" is actually the correct word?<br/><br/>/crotchety                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371412/#Comment_371412" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T09:56:36+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  9:56AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2012 9:57AM by J_Walton.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

I hadn't even though about GM neutrality as essential to old-school play.<br/><br/>In my own return to old-school over the last three years I've found one element to be most essential to what I aim at in an old-school experience, and it has surprised me a great deal. When I DM I rely heavily on old, color-laden texts that may or may not have a direct connection to the rule set we're currently using. This arose naturally out of using our first set of Apocalypse World-style basic moves in conjunction with AD&amp;D texts. At the time we used the old rules for absolutely everything not covered by the "when you" clauses of the basic moves. What I found was that there was an incredibly rich vein of productive detail packed into the monster descriptions, spell descriptions, and mechanical sub-systems of the old games (random tables are part of this, but they are only a sub-set). I think that for me this fulfills a role very similar to the state of mind that Eero mentions above. The old rules are a rich, layered source of bits and pieces that came from different places and were put in for different reasons, many of which may not be relevant anymore. This sounds like a weakness, but I find it\u2019s really a strength for a couple of reasons:<br/>-\tIt\u2019s a source of ideas, content, and fiction that would not otherwise have been incorporated<br/>-\tIt frees me up from concerns of game balance, my expectations of the fiction, and mechanical homogenization which I\u2019m otherwise prone to<br/>-\tIt gives me free reign to experiment with old game texts and see what nuggets of awesome I can unearth<br/><br/>So when I run an old-school game, I run a bricollage of old-school texts supported by whatever mechanics are easiest. For example, for dungeon crawl I use Dungeon World basic moves and playbooks supplemented with the AD&amp;D Monster Manual and DMG, Michael Curtis\u2019 Dungeon Alphabet, and material Zak Smith's and Jeff Reients' blogs. I use and old megadungeon by Jeff Poag (Mines of Khunmar) that has maps and notes but isn\u2019t fully detailed. Lately I've been running Metamorphosis Alpha. I use a super stripped down Apocalypse World hack with just one core move (because it provides a familiar framework for the players) and then the old MA rules for everything they don't cover.<br/><br/>So I guess what I think is essential to the OSR is a heavily layered set of texts that encompass a broad swath of gamer culture organized according to multiple principles and priorities with no single unitary point of view dominating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski" title="James Maliszewski"><img alt="James Maliszewski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Maliszewski">James Maliszewski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371468/#Comment_371468" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T13:41:26+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  1:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: James Maliszewski</cite>I will say, though, that I think the trend toward<i>emulating</i>other media rather than merely taking inspiration from them is at least a baby-step away from what I consider the hallmarks of old school play.</blockquote>\nI think I understand this, but would you provide an example?<br/><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> took a lot of inspiration from (among other things) Howard's Conan yarns, but the rules of <i>D&amp;D</i> don't include rules specifically designed to replicate, say, Conan's fighting moves. The inspiration isn't "hardcoded" into the rules so that every combat feels like something ripped from the pages of <i>Weird Tales</i>. By contrast, <i>Champions</i>, with its segments and phases, is explicitly trying to mimic the way slugfests play out in comics (whether it succeeds or fails is irrelevant). Now, I'm not saying that <i>Champions</i> or any other game that tries to emulate its inspiration via rules is necessarily off the old school reservation, but it's a step in that direction, at least to my mind. As RPGs become more tightly focused thematically and then create rules structures to support that focus, we see a shift away from "old school" design.<br/><br/>Did that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371471/#Comment_371471" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T14:15:46+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  2:15PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Maliszewski</cite>Did that make any sense?</blockquote>\nSounds right to me, and a good insight too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371472/#Comment_371472" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T14:28:09+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  2:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Maliszewski</cite>Did that make any sense?</blockquote>\nI think so.<br/><br/>Even the D&amp;D rules are trying to mimic something, though, aren't they?

But we know that Dave Arneson was the one who created the proto-cleric class as a monster hunter patterned on Van Helsing, so to counter the power of a vampire PC in his Blackmoor campaign named Sir Fang.

What bugs me about the OSR is the tendency to take this lacuna as a feature, and simply say, "For some sufficiently high value of 'good,' a good GM can solve this problem."  That ain't very helpful; the fact that this problem persists across 35 years of play suggests that, perhaps, the "good" GM is significantly less common than one might wish.<br/><br/>But what form would this advice take, if you're not turning it into procedure?  Other than something like, <br/><br/>"Major NPC's should have their own agendas.  Figure out what this NPC wants in a very local, immediate sense, and what resources he or she can bear on that problem.  Resources might include physical force, magic, social influence, or any kind of reward; it might include anything else you can imagine.  If your players are furthering the NPC's goals, he or she is likely to help; if the players are hindering those goals, the NPC is likely to oppose them.  Remember that in the real world, wise people tend to avoid risks or confrontations unless necessary or they have an overwhelming advantage."<br/><br/>"Keep your NPC's motivations super-simple!  Your players need to be able to understand the NPC's motivations, and that's hard if each NPC is Dmitri Karamazov.  Also, convoluted NPC motivations will increasingly cause the game to center around the NPC's rather than the players."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/untimately" title="untimately"><img alt="untimately" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/085/n2DMX2JRS72SF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/untimately">untimately</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371863/#Comment_371863" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T21:13:35+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  9:13PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>Interesting that nobody's yet mentioned alignment.

If you don't play with alignments, there are quite a few areas of the rules that you need to adjust in order for the game to make sense.<br/><br/>Really, I think alignment is a contested notion. The modern (that is, AD&amp;D 1E and later) idea of alignment is more about behavior and morals, whereas the earlier conception is more about cosmic forces. You are not "chaotic" if you murder someone, but you might further the cause of chaos if you help goblins destroy a village.<br/><br/>I wrote more about this here:<br/><br/><a href="http://untimately.blogspot.com/2012/02/alignment-musings.html" rel="nofollow">http://untimately.blogspot.com/2012/02/alignment-musings.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/untimately" title="untimately"><img alt="untimately" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/085/n2DMX2JRS72SF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/untimately">untimately</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371864/#Comment_371864" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T21:19:19+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  9:19PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 9:19PM by untimately.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger GS</cite>I want to add that just because something's not in the rules of an Old School game, doesn't mean it can't emerge from play.</blockquote>To add to that in the other direction, just because something is in the rules (or even dominates the rules) does not necessarily mean it is what the game is about.<br/><br/>See here:<br/><br/><a href="http://revolution21days.blogspot.com/2012/01/why-d-has-lots-of-rules-for-combat.html" rel="nofollow">http://revolution21days.blogspot.com/2012/01/why-d-has-lots-of-rules-for-combat.html</a><br/><br/>In Odyssey's words:\n<blockquote>D&amp;D, in all editions, has a lot of rules for combat. That's generally what the majority of the game's rules are for, even when it's got fairly detailed rules for non-combatty type things. That doesn't mean that D&amp;D is "about" combat, though, at least in all editions. Sometimes, in fact, it means that it's very much not about combat.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The main function of the combat rules, instead, is to make combat deadly, in a way that's fairly adjudication agnostic. If the DM is doing her job right, she's going to kill your character sometimes, and you're going to know that you deserved it. It needs fairly detailed combat rules because it's relatively difficult to adjudicate combat compared to most of what you do in D&amp;D, and relatively important compared to most of what you do in D&amp;D that it be adjudicated "correctly," or at least in a fairly neutral way.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371960/#Comment_371960" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T13:58:52+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  1:58PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still think alignment is easier from a wargames/team shirt perspective.

The relationship between morality/ethics and alignment is implied rather than outright stated and is thus open to some interpretation. Consider, too, that alignment is present in both Moorcock and Anderson (from whom Moorcock got the idea) and, in both cases, it's more of an "us vs. them" kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
