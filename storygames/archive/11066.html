It's about gangs that square off in the badlands, like Necromunda or Mordheim or Malifaux.<br/>Ideally, I'd like the game to use setting-neutral terms, so that you could play port it to Necromunda or Mordheim or Malifaux.<br/><br/>You have a character! That character has some Tags, which are like tendencies or stuff they are good at or whatever.<br/>Some examples include: Command, Grit, Precise, Weird...<br/><br/>During character creation, you buy Powers and Items for your character.<br/>The Powers and Items have Tags as well.<br/>If you have none of the Tags of the Power/Item, it costs more. If you have all of them, it costs less.<br/><br/>I'm trying to figure out the Tags that relate to weapon skills and fighting skills.<br/>I thought about dividing the Tags into things like: Precision Weapons, Heavy Weapons...<br/>Then I realized it'd be way better to divide the Tags into the combat functions, like blowin' up terrain, killin' a single dude, crowd control, etc.<br/><br/>So, what are those combat functions? and what are some good single word Tags to describe 'em?<br/>The game is a story games hippy-ified tactical minis game. Sort of.<br/>It's about gangs (of 2-12), who fight in ruins and terrain-heavy places.<br/><br/>So far I've identified:<br/><br/>1.) Blowin' up terrain, using explosives (Tag might be: DEMOLITIONS)<br/><br/>2.) Crowd control, using big indiscriminating weapons to hit lots of enemies (no idea for Tags)<br/><br/>3.) Shooting as a diversion, for cover fire, to bring dudes out of cover, in general - not for the purpose of actually killing (no idea for Tags)<br/><br/>4.) Snipering, assassination, target strikes (Tag might be: TARGETED)<br/><br/>5.) Charging into close combat, assault (Tag might be: ASSAULT)<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245455/#Comment_245455" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T01:04:36+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  1:04AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean like actual definition names?

It might be a correct modern military term for all I know, I'm more interested in historic battles than modern ones, it's just not speaking to me. Historically, I suppose it would be called 'Skirmishing'. In more modern times 'Sniping' is probably more accepted. Also, suppressive fire is generally for keeping people IN cover where they can't get at you, not driving them out of it. For that, your artillery is a better bet.<br/><br/>For charging into close combat, I think assault is probably best but you might consider extending it to Close Assault just to differentiate it from general fighting.<br/><br/>Have you considered the roles of sappers and battlefield engineers at all? Demolitions using careful planning and timed explosives (as opposed to just blasting it with a tank) would most likely be in their arena. This brings to mind another way of looking at it: by the character's role in the army, rather than as a single task. Thus you might have<br/><br/>1. Sapper<br/>2. Artilleryman (or possibly Grenadier)<br/>3. Foot Soldier<br/>4. Sniper<br/>5.

But I also think your tags for it are completely valid.<br/><br/>So, yeah. You're reading them right. Thanks!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sebastian K.

Because the knife is "up close" and "quiet". Why carry a pistol instead of an assault rifle? Because the pistol is "concealable" and "light".<br/><br/>In other words, players are going to looking at these tags in order to make choices about situation and fighting style. Create the tags so that those choices actually matter.</blockquote>\nGood point, Wordman!<br/><br/>The examples you give are too finnicky for my taste, and imply some stuff about gameplay that doesn't jive with me (the importance of concealability in a Necromuna-esque fight game?), but in general I'm totally on board with what you're saying, and want to make it happen.<br/><br/>I've added "Stealth" as a tag, to reflect the up close and quiet kind of kill.<br/><br/>In general, my lean towards type of attack (Assault, Barrage, Direct Fire, Sharpshooting) and style of attack (Dangerous, Tactical, etc) is an attempt to create just what you're talking about... tags that reflect situation and fighting style, making them matter.<br/><br/>The trick is that the tags themselves carry no mechanical weight, in play, per se...<br/>They modify the cost of a Power or Item during chargen - if you have the tags that the Power or Item has, then it's cheaper for you.<br/>Also, they <i>imply</i> a cluster of effects. <i>Generally</i>, most things with the Dangerous tag will impose a Health risk for failed actions and give you a higher bonus...<br/>Finally, some Powers reference "the number of powers you have with the X tag" or some-such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245706/#Comment_245706" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T07:33:39+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  7:33AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2009 7:36AM by Sebastian.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Direct" is way too vague to convey much of anything, IMO.<br/>Ranged and Ballistic are both okay, but too broad - sharpshooting &amp; barrage are both styles of ranged attack too.<br/>Direct Fire is too textbook-y.<br/>This is the one where I still feel like I'm grasping for a word that hasn't surfaced yet.</blockquote>Would you consider getting rid of Direct Fire completely? It might be more interesting if there were no 'standard' kind of weapon attack. Like, you pick a pistol and it's Quickdraw, or a shotgun and it's Blitz, or a bow &amp; arrow and it's Stealth, etc. If we know that every ranged weapon can attack, then it might not be necessary to label the standard attack. Instead, if you want to show that the weapon is ranged, offering a good selection of ranged attributes (four or five) would cover that base?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip" title="King Turnip"><img alt="King Turnip" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/King%20Turnip">King Turnip</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245813/#Comment_245813" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T14:32:36+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  2:32PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2009 2:34PM by King Turnip.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obligatory grumbling:<br/>Assault describes an attack (offensive operation,) and much of dedicated assault gear (offensive hand grenades, as one example) are built with the assumption that the user will not always have the benefit of hard cover or stable/stationary position.
