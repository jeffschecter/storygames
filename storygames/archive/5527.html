Here's me looking at this from the specific angle of play as training. <br/><br/>1. Play as training: Teens, fighting and nurturing<br/><br/>One thing that got me thinking about this was Tynan Sylvester's <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3495/compulsion_engineers.php?page=3" rel="nofollow">article</a> in Gamasutra, where he talks about a few patterns of play that might be related to learning by practice: Fighting and nurturing. A lot of games are about fighting creatures; some games are about nurturing creatures. Both of these seem to fulfil some playing need in many participants, especially young teens.<br/><br/>However, when teens fight stuff in games, they usually don't fight anything they're likely to meet in the real world - bears and wolves, or soldiers from real-world enemy countries. They fight orcs and dragons and stormtroopers. They don't nurture babies either, usually; they look after Tamagotchi or magical familiars. <br/><br/>I think perhaps some of the fantasy element is there to stop players from actually connecting too much to the <i>object</i> of the fantasy, instead focusing on the <i>relational training</i>. In play, we - as a society of humans - don't want the player to actually care for the Tamagotchi like he/she would for a real baby. We want the player to train empathy and caring and paying attention to others' needs. We don't want the player to care about the orcs in any real way, either. We want him/her to think about tactics, and weaponry, and the joy of battle.<br/><br/>2. An open question<br/><br/>Why do we as <i>adults</i> incorporate fantasy in our games? What's its function? I assume there is one, since there are so very many games that use these elements. However, I'm curious what it is. <br/><br/>- Are we using fantasy for play as training? If so, for what? <br/>- Are we using fantasy as metaphor? If so, why not use the real thing? <br/>- Are we using fantasy to distance ourselves from the subject matter? If so, why?<br/><br/>Think about your favorite games. Do they have strong fantasy elements? What would happen if you removed those elements?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124060/#Comment_124060" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T04:10:29+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  4:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think it helps to show a thing thru contrast.<br/>\nby that i mean, you can often times show a truth better thru a lie, than just simply stating a truth.<br/>\ni'm really fascinated by the role fantasy plays.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lars" title="Lars"><img alt="Lars" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lars">Lars</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124067/#Comment_124067" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T05:34:09+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  5:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One answer could be that fantasy simply makes things easier, as in it provides the means for a lot of situations, tactical and narrative-wise that could'nt happen in a real-world setting without breaking the in-game causality, so to speak.<br/>\nExample: you want the highest possible stakes for a conflict? Make the villain an evil god, who threatens the entire universe! (vulgar, yes I know, but you get the point). Or you want an interesting tactical battle, out of the ordinary? Dragons, mages and flying castles will do that for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there's the thing about metaphors. I agree with Nate that metaphors definitely expresses some truths better than simply stating those truths outright would; isn't that what the whole poem-thing is about, anyways? Using metaphores, because they say something, that couldn't easily be said without metaphors?<br/>\nThe reason metaphors rock, artistically, is because they require interpretation. Which means the exact truth expressed by the metaphors, varies from person to person and indeed sometimes even from time to time. This means that the reader, him-/herself is actually contributing to the work, simply by reading it! This of course commits the reader to the text, more than plain text would, since the reader is investing his/her own ressources in it. It is this commitment that makes the text extra fulfilling.<br/>\nFor more about this, read Wolfgang Iser, especially his work on reader-response theory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It makes it into something you can deal with; it's so absurd to have action figures and silly putty solving your problems that, sure, if they can talk, why can't they patch up my family? There was a game a few years back at Gen Con where the players decided to eliminate the fantasy, and it was heart-wrenching. But the subject matter was pretty common for UtB. It's just that, without the fantasy, what the players saw was the <em>complexity</em> of the situation. They couldn't get their heads around the human tragedy in place. If there had been magically talking toys, they would have known the way things would go.</p>\n<p>In Shock: you take stuff you care about that you read about in the newspaper, stuff that you have an emotional reaction to, and then you say, "OK, so, Ba'athists are being reintroduced into government in Iraq, and that makes me think what might it be like if, like, we were all living on a generation ship, and there was this cruel dictator of the ship who was overthrown, and we've purged all the administrators, but now we need administrators?"</p>\n<p>Fantasy \u2014 and metaphor in general \u2014\xa0allows you to simplify serious problems so you can address them instead of wallow in confusion. You can take the same problem, run it through several metaphorical filters, and look at the problem from each of those perspectives, eventually building a more complex understanding of the issue.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124114/#Comment_124114" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T09:14:04+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  9:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love fantasy, and I always have.

More importantly, you can make a character who is immediately relevant to that (personified) concept. <br/><br/>A tsunami, and the impact it has on real people, is really too big for my brain, and it's not something I can have a big impact on.

As noted, roleplaying continues to facilitate the exploration of mature roles and activities in a safe space, even in adulthood.  You can try stuff and fail without, say, destroying your marriage or savings account.<br/><br/>One reason you didn't mention is that fantasy elements serve as a lingua franca for escapism - everybody knows what to expect when you introduce Tolkein-esque elves and dwarves.  If you are in general agreement that escapism is what you want, you can go with those tropes without any cognitive dissonance.  <br/><br/>There's an element of fantasy in even the most hard-nosed games, because of the abstraction.  We're not there, it isn't real, we're recreating an event and having a new experience.  What's interesting to me is the blurring of player and character you see in, say, some jeepform - where a player might monologue on a topic, or inform character experience based on their own.  This seems like a gateway to less "fantasy" play without losing the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124116/#Comment_124116" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T09:25:50+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  9:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Special effects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124137/#Comment_124137" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T10:33:04+00:00" title="February  3, 2008 10:33AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about because it's just fun to play in a fantasy setting.

Bizarre.<br/><br/>I think one answer to the original poster's question stems out of sci-fi and fantasy's birth out of futurism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  If the situation is variable, from the mundane to the fantastic, but the themes remain the same, that speaks about something constant about the human condition.  Having a fantastic or wondrous situation only serves to highlight the things that stay the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124176/#Comment_124176" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T14:34:50+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  2:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Julia says this in another thread about Steal Away Jordan:<br/><br/>"when magic isn't real, the brutality has no filter".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124248/#Comment_124248" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T02:07:42+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  2:07AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree with that, for me the fantasy is about introducing distance from the subject matter, both in games with deep topics and those without.<br/><br/>In games with deep topics the fantasy is a necessary distancing, because otherwise the subject matter is too difficult to talk about, it allows us to engage with something without being overpowered by it. For example which is easier to game about, child abuse in the 20th century, or child burning evil magicians in the 14th century? I think for most it is the later, introducing distance in terms of time, space and reality level, allows us to deal with topics that otherwise would be too much. We can make use of really big and powerful triggers and motivations for our characters without it overwhelming us as players.<br/><br/>The same thing happens in games with less serious subject matters too. If we want to go out and have a good old fight filled romp it helps us avoid the issues raised by killing people, slaying someone's father, or child or husband or wife, if we turn them all into monsters which the book tells us have no redeeming qualities. It's why computer games where you shoot aliens are so much less controversial than ones where you shoot people going to work <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Of course that second use has its flaws, especially in making us, as gamers, too blase about doing things which are actually horrible if you take that veil away. That is what John Wick was getting at with Orks I think, making us look at the 'monsters' as people and then saying "so how come you thought it was right to call them monsters?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124276/#Comment_124276" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T07:15:24+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  7:15AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Metaphor and escapism are what I see as motivations.

Can you answer Matthijs' questions from that point of view?  I'm thinking particularly of "What would happen if you removed those elements?"<br/><br/>Does it stop being fun?</blockquote>\nOK, I don't think the fantasy element is required for fun.  I enjoy exploring historical and modern real world settings.  It's not a matter of fun or not, just different types of fun.  For many people this is not the case.  They find the real world to be too boring to enjoy roleplaying in.  The fantasy element is vital.  They won't enjoy a game without it.<br/><br/>My primary reason for wanting to include fantasy in roleplaying is I enjoy fantasy fiction.  I want to explore or emulate those worlds through roleplaying.  Obviously, you can't do this without including fantasy elements.<br/><br/>I personally don't see fantasy as having any value as a safety valve.  The fact we are creating fiction is distance enough for me.  If I'm not willing to do something to a fictional person, I wouldn't be willing to do it to a fictional orc.<br/><br/>edit:  I had another thought.  I think fantasy can help with suspending disbelief.  It can aleviate pressure to "get things right."  After all, in a world were wizards throw lightning bolts out of their hands does it really matter that socioeconomic system depicted does not resemble medieval life even remotely?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124286/#Comment_124286" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-04T08:17:02+00:00" title="February  4, 2008  8:17AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WillH</cite>I think fantasy can help with suspending disbelief.

Elements of fantasy can be used to sort of zoom in on and distill certain types of human drama or issues or themes or whatever you want to call them. So, maybe it's not really about whether the fantasy distances us from the drama, or whether it magnifies it--maybe it's just looking at it through a certain lens?<br/><br/>What do I mean? It's like those science fiction stories where two lovers, instead of just being separated, or separated _for eternity_, or where one travels near the speed of light and finds the other 20 years older than when they had last seen them.<br/><br/>You're sort of maginifying the context and distancing yourself from it at the same time. I don't know if I'm describing it very well.<br/><br/>--The drama is weak, or hard to relate to, so we ramp it up through fantastic elements. Now, the evil schoolteacher is _threatening the whole world_!!!<br/>--At the same time, the unreal nature of the thing helps us deal with it more easily.<br/><br/>2. Re-Creating the Myth<br/><br/>There's a book called "The Seven Basic Plots", which argues for certain elements the author considers fundamental to all storytelling. I think the author's ideas are fishy at best, but a lot of the stuff he says really, certainly _does_ apply to a lot of mythology, legends, and fairy tales.<br/><br/>In his analysis, those stories typically contain a number of elements, like the "magic weapons" (or tools) conferred upon the warrior/hero figure, or the necessity of traveling to a distant and alien place in order to turn the corner from childhood to adulthood.<br/><br/>He suggests that, as science and discovery has taken away our belief in "magic weapons" and distant unexplored lands, science fiction/fantasy allows us to reintroduce them into our stories. Then they can resonate with whatever part of us resonates with myths and fairy tales. <br/><br/>But, really, I have no idea. I'm looking forward to seeing this thread develop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124590/#Comment_124590" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T12:03:36+00:00" title="February  5, 2008 12:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do not consider Fantasy so much an escape, but more of a Free Place.<br/><br/>Allow me to elaborate. I am a very creative person. Since I was a little kid, I liked dreaming and imagining stuff. The stories I was told, the songs I listened, even the cartoons I watched. I recreated and elaborated on those stories. I remember my first "pseudo role playing" being playing with some friends to being the Thundercats (remember that show?). I did't just re-enacted the cartoons. I created and imagined my own stories.<br/><br/>The point is I like fantasy because it allows me to keep dreaming, imagining, creating new and amazing worlds (and characters).<br/><br/>Of course, that is why I became a writter and a GM in the first place, but still I like reinterpreting the worlds and characters and stuff in other people's settings. From Tolkien to Greenwood, from Star Wars to Matrix, from my own setting to those of other people... I just love the possibility of elaborating on those "magical" and full of possibilities worlds.<br/><br/>So fantasy becomes that Free Place for me, where I can play, dream and create.<br/><br/>People could argue that fiction is fiction, and that I could still do that in a non-fantasy setting... Yet it lacks that epic and infinite feel only fantasy can provide. At least for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124695/#Comment_124695" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T21:45:06+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  9:45PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To enable furries.

In play, we - as a society of humans - don't want the player to actually care for the Tamagotchi like he/she would for a real baby. We want the player to train empathy and caring and paying attention to others' needs. We don't want the player to care about the orcs in any real way, either. We want him/her to think about tactics, and weaponry, and the joy of battle.<br/></blockquote>\n\u201cWe \u2013 as a society of humans want/don\u2019t want\u201d. I thing that, in an evolutionary sense, playing \u2014 and hence gaming \u2014 has a function, and that it is learning. But I also believe that, at the individual level, we do not play for education nor training (as for most of us most of the time, we do not make sex to have children). We play because it gives us fun. (But what is fun?) Education or training may result. <br/><br/>And henceforth, most games are created to please. (Who? How?)<br/><br/>Some games are designed to educate/train. They rarely are as pleasing.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Why do we as<i>adults</i>incorporate fantasy in our games? What's its function? I assume there is one, since there are so very many games that use these elements. However, I'm curious what it is.<br/></blockquote>\nBecause it is fun, and because it is easy. (More on this later on.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite> - Are we using fantasy for play as training? If so, for what? </blockquote>\nI am sure I do not game for training and I know of nobody who does. However, rp-gaming experience <i>is</i> useful in real-life situation, so training happens. I do not think this has anything to do with fantasy, but just with RPG and games in general.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>- Are we using fantasy as metaphor?</blockquote>\n(As I see it used here, I think <i>allegory</i> would be a better matching word for what I believe we/you meant.)<br/><br/>I do not think setting-crafters \u2014 they may be game-designers, GM, creative players, \u2026 \u2014 often consciously build a metaphor/allegory. I believe metaphors might be projected in settings, either <i>unconsciously</i> build into the setting at creation, or <i>seen</i> as metaphor when interpreted by someone with the \u201cright\u201d sensibilities.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>- Are we using fantasy as metaphor? If so, why not use the real thing? </blockquote>\nFor the same reason we use metaphor in other media. (ie: I don\u2019t really know. Human nature, culture, and all that stuff, I guess.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>- Are we using fantasy to distance ourselves from the subject matter? If so, why?</blockquote>\nI believe distance is important in the fun factor of RPG, for certain widespread kinds of fun (escapism, power-fantasy \u2026). Fantasy isn\u2019t the only distancing mean available, but it is a good one: simple, effective, pleasing.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>Fantasy is, in certain ways, the MS Windows of RPG. It is the standard. It is not better than other settings, but it is there (in RPG and other medias), nearly everyone knows it. Doing something different means more to explain, more to understand and integrate. It is easier, intrinsically, but also because it is so widespread. (Kind of a vicious circle here: it stays widespread because it is widespread.)<br/><br/>Now fantasy has other distinguishing characteristics.<br/><br/>It echoes of a mythical golden age, of legends, of myths and children stories. Here we can find rich inspiring material, and common ground for communication. And these echoes give fantasy a special flavour/colour.<br/><br/>It is very well adapted to power-fantasies.<br/><br/>It is a very free and forgiving theme, for setting-crafting and for playing. You can introduce nearly everything in fantasy settings. You do not have to work hard to figure the why and the how. In (most)  fantasy worlds, your characters can get away with many things (killing, stealing, betrayal, \u2026) that would have harder and more intricate consequences in other settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126698/#Comment_126698" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T17:28:03+00:00" title="February 14, 2008  5:28PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>On a sidenote, am I the only one who thinks "furries" only refers to the anime-style cutesy ones, like Ironclaw et al?

The plot is consistent with some plausible protection of a scientific truth, and it can be explained in a credible say. Take any work from Asimov or Bradbury, for example. It can focus on a specific aspect of the future (Fahrenheit 451) or in the overall impact of scientific advancement in the world (or even known space) in a larger scale (Foundation).<br/><br/>Soft Sci-Fi is when there is no Hard Science behind the narration. The aesthetics are those of an advanced future (robots, spaceships, alien races), but the plausible scientific truth is second to the mythological and epical feel (although controversial, I'd place Star Trek and Star Wars in here).<br/><br/><br/>I believe a similar classification could be used for Fantasy. There is Hard Fantasy (where the setting itself is based on the amalgamation of fantastic elements and its internally consistent Rules, such as Magic and the Supernatural, such as LOTR), and Soft Fantasy (where magic isn't explained, and the fantasy elements are there more for looks and feels than because they are an integral part of the world, such as the Harry Potter books).<br/><br/>And there are some works that could possibly work for both genres.

Here is a quote from the Wikipedia article on 'On Fairy-Stories':<br/><br/>'Tolkien suggests that fairy stories allow the reader to review his or her own world from the "perspective" of a different world. This concept, which shares much in common with phenomenology, Tolkien calls "recovery," in the sense that one's unquestioned assumptions might be recovered and changed by an outside perspective. Second, he defends fairy stories as offering escapist pleasure to the reader. And third, Tolkien suggests that fairy stories (can) provide moral or emotional consolation, through their happy ending, which he terms a "eucatastrophe."'<br/><br/>All three of these are possible within gaming, but escapism is one of the most likely. People move away from their everyday world of paychecks and bosses. The more distance we have from the 'now' the stronger this is. Tolkien thought pre-industrial settings were key to this as escapism was tied, for him, to escaping industrial society. This might explain the plethora of pre-industrial settings.<br/><br/>Linked to this is the notion of a happy ending, which we might term the chance to be a hero. Tolkien did not think fantasy and tragedy mixed. I'm not sure if he is right, but the broader genre does focus on being heroic.  Certainly games such as D&amp;D implicitly focus on the heroes as prime-movers.<br/><br/>The idea of recovery is perhaps what storytelling games reach for, the idea that we can learn something, by experiencing reality through a distorted mirror.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm beginning to sound like a broken record by raising Tolkien's poetics here again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127470/#Comment_127470" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T04:09:31+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  4:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 5:02AM by Ajax_Aldwyne.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite>Ajax's comments have me wondering something:  Are we talking about Fantasy as in the limited sense of "D&amp;D fantasy", a melange of pseudo-historical settings and fantastic monsters and overt magic, or are we talking about fantasy in the literary sense? .</blockquote>\nOuch, it seems we do not have the same expectations about fantasy.<br/><br/>While I have no strict definition of fantasy, I can recognize it when I see it. (Starwars, anybody? Oh, many thanks to Tristan <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I was thinking about a large section of what-I-call-fantasy, from Tolkien to Planescape, from Conan to Diskworld, from Robin Hobb to Forgotten Realms, from Ars Magica to Runequest. Not Stephen King, nor Ann Rice nor Cthulhu, nor Mage: The ascension. Is this clearer?<br/><br/>So, I\u2019d say, rougly: a setting inspired from our world\u2019s history, spanning from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages (at most early Renaissance), with real magic/god(s) in variable proportions.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite>Are we talking about Fantasy as in th bookstore section, or fantasy in this sense:<br/><cite>Posted By: Wikipedia</cite>The identifying traits of fantasy are the inclusion of fantastic elements in a self-coherent (internally consistent) setting.

The genre is usually associated with the overall look, feel and themes of the European Early Middle Ages (including architecture, dress and technology), while the actual setting is often a fictional plane or planet where magic and magical beings are commonplace. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction). In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite>Ajax's comments certainly don't apply to the literary definition of fantasy. .</blockquote>\nWhich is? Would \u201cAny setting with elements of magic or supernatural\u201d do?<br/>If so, I believe the first part of my post (before the horizontal rule) certainly still apply, as sometimes do the last two paragraphs.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite>A game like<i>Lacuna Part 1</i>is pure fantasy, occurring entirely in a fantasy world setting, but its very "different" and doesn't make immediate sense to many gamers (I tried explaining it to a few people at ConQuest NW today, so the looks of confusion are vivid in my memory).</blockquote>\nSorry, I do not know <i>Lacuna Part 1</i>. Could you give me a link to a place where I could learn more?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MKAdams</cite>I think the primary function of fantasy in role-playing games is too distract one from the incredibly difficulty that is capturing reality in rules mechanics.  While story games seem to work within a context of the real world, where conflicts are resolved in scenes rather than in tasks, traditional games rely on the elements of the fantastic to suspend player belief and get them to accept the unreality of the game rules.</blockquote>\nIf it is, it is not, in my experience, working too well. On one hand, fantasy elements do not hide non-fantasy (\u201crealistic\u201d?) rules (combat, health &amp;co), they are just additions. On the other hand, simulationists (and rule-lawyers, but this is another tale) argue as well over the fantasy elements as over the \u201crealistic\u201d ones. (And when some elements are part from real-world inspiration and part fantasy\u2026 ugh! Don\u2019t talk to me about \u201cinfravision\u201d.)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>I think in the context of the OP, we're talking about the more general definition of fantasy, though many people have answered in ways that seem as though they're assuming D&amp;D/Tolkienesque fantasy.</blockquote>\nI had to re-read the OP multiple times (and do some research) after Wolfe attracted our attention before getting this. Problem is the \u201cbroader fantasy\u201d clues are rather discreet and I do not have the culture necessary to understand.<br/><br/>I see \u201cD&amp;D, were-rats, a setting so distant in time and location that it might as well be fantasy\u201d. I see \u201corcs and dragons and stormtroopers\u201d, \u201ctamagotchi or magical familiars\u201d.

It's fairly straightforward.  Fantasy is literature that contains elements of the fantastic in a internally consistent setting.  This can be best understood looking at what fantasy is not: it is not realism, for there are fantastic elements.  It is not absurdism, because the fantastic elements are explicable and consistent.<br/><br/>I don't really see what's so abstract about it.  It's only really confusing if you try to hold on to both a literary definition and a bookstore (or genre) definition at the same time.  The literary definition of fantasy includes the bookstore definition, but also much more.  It includes sci-fi, horror, and many other genres.\n<blockquote>From thesame Wikipedia article, I find the following description of fantasy to be much more to my taste and much more readable:\n<blockquote><cite>From:Fantasy \u2013 Wikipedia</cite>Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting. The genre is usually associated with the overall look, feel and themes of the European Early Middle Ages (including architecture, dress and technology), while the actual setting is often a fictional plane or planet where magic and magical beings are commonplace. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of technological and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three (collectively known as speculative fiction). In its broadest sense, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.</blockquote></blockquote>\nThat would be the "bookstore" definition.  Both definitions are useful.  The bookstore definition is great for pigeon-holing materials, which might sound bad but is great if you want to go find something (always easier to find thinsg that have been and can be cataloged).  The biggest problem with the bookstore definition is that it can cause ideas that aren't easily pigeon-holed to get suppressed.\n<blockquote><b>Ajax's comments certainly don't apply to the literary definition of fantasy.</b><br/>Which is? Would \u201cAny setting with elements of magic or supernatural\u201d do?</blockquote>\nThe literary definition of fantasy is literature that contains elements of the fantastic in a internally consistent setting.  References to magic and the supernatural won't do, because many forms of fantasy (science fiction, and alt. history to name two).  A story set in an alternate version of history where the Nazis won World War 2 and now control America would be fantasy, but would not contain elements of magic or the supernatural.\n<blockquote>If so, I believe the first part of my post (before the horizontal rule) certainly still apply, as sometimes do the last two paragraphs.</blockquote>\nI was only referring to the comment I quoted, not the rest of your post.\n<blockquote>Sorry, I do not know<i>Lacuna Part 1</i>. Could you give me a link to a place where I could learn more?</blockquote>\nJust google it.  Basically it's about agents of an organization (called Mystery) that project themselves into the collective unconscious of mankind, where they hunt down and eradicate the elements of people's personalities that lead to antisocial behavior, which manifest as monsters.  And the longer they saty in that world, the more tense it gets.  Then eventually spidermen in soviet uniforms show up and force everyone to "eject" and return to the normal world.  It's very, very <i>different</i>.  But it's fantasy, in the literary sense.  It's not fantasy in the bookstore sense.  It might be science fiction, or it could be horror, or it could be "speculative fiction." (which is a dumb term, since all fiction is speculative).\n<blockquote>If it is, it is not, in my experience, working too well. On one hand, fantasy elements do not hide non-fantasy (\u201crealistic\u201d?) rules (combat, health &amp;co), they are just additions. On the other hand, simulationists (and rule-lawyers, but this is another tale) argue as well over the fantasy elements as over the \u201crealistic\u201d ones. (And when some elements are part from real-world inspiration and part fantasy\u2026 ugh! Don\u2019t talk to me about \u201cinfravision\u201d.)</blockquote>\nHah!  Yes, in some games the fantastic elements are so poorly designed and poorly thought out (and early version of infravision are GREAT example of this) that they cause more problems than they solve.<br/><br/>But what I was getting at is more along these lines:  In pulp fantasy and action flicks and the like, heroes get shot, stabbed, beaten and thrown against walls, and keep on fighting.  In this sense, even a movie like Die Hard is pure fantasy.  No real person could survive that much abuse and keep fighting.  An abstract combat system like the one in D&amp;D, where you're either fully functional or dead/unconscious, is great for doing this sort of heroic action.  If you place that combat system in a real world setting, with cops and robbers, or soldiers in war, then it becomes really goofy -- especially to those of us who know something about violence in the real world (I'm a criminal justice major!).  Place the same combat system in a fantasy setting with dragons and princesses, and the lack of reality in such a system becomes not only tolerable, but "genre appropriate."<br/><br/>That's why I think fantasy (literary sense) is such a huge component of RPGs.  The fantastic elements make it easier to accept the fantasy of unrealistic combat systems, wonky handling of physics, psychologically flat characters, and many other elements of RPGs that are so common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127792/#Comment_127792" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T15:32:46+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  3:32PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 3:33PM by Tristan.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The literary definition of fantasy is literature that contains elements of the fantastic in a internally consistent setting.

And I don't mean that in a patronizing or condescending way, though I'm sure it sounds that way.  Fiction is about things that did not happen.  From there, you have essentially two forms of fiction: realistic and fantastic.  <br/><br/>Alternative History is a subgenre of fantasy, because it relies on the <i>fantastic</i>, on things that can only be <i>imagined</i> -- and I realize that all fiction relies on things that are only imagined, but here I am talking about the fantastic as that which must <i>necessarily</i> rely on the imagination to exist.  A realistic narrative is (hopefully) indistinguishable from a true story (and of course, even true stories frequently rely on elements of fiction to fill in many holes), but a fantastic story immediately calls out that it is a false story, a fabrication, because it denies what we know/presume to know to be true.<br/><br/>In reality, the Nazis lost and America was never attacked, let alone conquered, so to tell a story about people in this setting is to indulge a fantasy.  The premise of the story contradicts reality, and no reader would ever wonder "Is this based on a real event?"  Phillip K. Dick's <i>The Man In The Castle</i> is fantasy story, and not simply because the protagonist realizes he's starring in a book that exists only to ask "What if the Nazis won?" late in the third act.  It's a fantasy because it introduces a wide range of facts about the world that aren't true.  There aren't really Happyland brand marijuana cigarettes, people don't speak in hushed whispers of the "African tragedy," and there isn't a huge demand in Japan for rare pre-War Americana with the old American flag on it.  These things are every bit as unreal and fantastic as goblins and unicorns, and they are entirely consistent with and within the imagined world Dick created.<br/><br/>I think this really important to a conversation about the question "What's the element of fantasy for? re: Games &amp; Gaming," especially if we want to talk about more than fantasy in D&amp;D&amp;D(erivatives).   If we go with a broad, literary definition of fantasy then we can talk in the same breath about fantasy and science fiction and "speculative fiction" (a ridiculous redundancy, <i>all</i> fiction is speculative fiction, realistic or fantastic)  When we understand the "element of fantasy" means "fantastic elements" we can stop talking about games trapped in genre ghettos, and talk about all games.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm making the best argument here.  I just think the question "Why include fantastic elements in games?" is a more interesting question than "Why include elements of the Fantasy genre in games?"  As a neophyte game designer working on his first game-for-publication (I've been writing game material for 15+ years, and playtested my first self-designed system when I was 14 in 1990), I find that first question much more engaging than the latter, since the game I'm designing is "modern supernatural horror."  And while that's a different <i>genre</i>, my answer to "Why include elements of the Modern Supernatural Horror genre in games?" would be the same as "Why include elements of the Fantasy genre in games?"  So why not just ask the real question that underlies all the (kind of pointless and trivial) discussion of genre, which is "Why include fantastic elements in games?"<br/><br/>The genre form questions ultimately just boil down to personal preference.  As long as I'm avoiding the question "Why include fantastic elements in games?" my answer is always going to boil down to "Because that's what interests me/I think other genres suck."  Why is <i>murder of crows</i> supernatural modern horror? Because that's what interests me.<br/><br/>But when I ask "Why include fantastic elements in games?" I have to admit, it's to avoid doing research.  Making a combat system that really <i>really</i> accurately modeled gun fights in alleyways, and the full depth of the psychologies of people involved in gunfights, would be an impossible task.  I don't have the time, resources, or inclination to do the amount of research it would take to come close to realizing that.  But I can make a system that's <i>more</i> realistic than most systems, and I can add supernatural elements that are clearly fantastic that provide high contrast to the realism of the combat system, and make it look more realistic by implicit comparison.  Sort of like how an average/pretty girl becomes better looking if you put her next to a heinous cow.<br/><br/>When you read through <i>murder of crows</i> you start with a background setting full of the fantastic (elder spawn, warlocks, the Illuminati) and then you hit the combat section and there's no fisticuffs, just dudes struggling and grappling and fighting with knees and elbows (because anyone who has ever been in a real fight knows this bullshit of "I hit you then you hit me then I hit you" is total nonsense), and then you realize getting shot can lead to months of intensive care in a hospital and that <i>seems</i> very realistic, and then there's more about monsters, so maybe you don't notice that linkage of skill to accuracy to damage fails to capture some of the remote possibilities of a real gunfights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127895/#Comment_127895" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T02:46:07+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  2:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MKAdams, <br/><br/>If even the invention of a non-real brand pitches a work into fantasy, everything is fantasy.<br/><br/>As there is no agreement on what is real or realistic, everything is fantasy.<br/><br/>I am not interested to go to that level of sterile hairsplitting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127951/#Comment_127951" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T07:46:21+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  7:46AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the phrase "Because that's what interests me" sums it up pretty well.

And that way we'll make stories and games and systems that can be interesting to someone else, who <b>also likes</b> the same sort of things we do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128090/#Comment_128090" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T13:14:18+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:14PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>MKAdams,<br/><br/>If even the invention of a non-real brand pitches a work into fantasy, everything is fantasy.<br/><br/>As there is no agreement on what is real or realistic, everything is fantasy.<br/><br/>I am not interested to go to that level of sterile hairsplitting.</blockquote>\nWell, no, you're wrong - or at least no one is saying that.

However, the meticulous dissection of what your definition of fantasy is, and your stance on the importance of proper categorization do not interest me. I also find those to be very wrong, but as I recognize this as a mostly subjective matter, I prefer to let it lie.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you will find that I am interested in the rest of this thread, including, of course, the other parts of your messages, and will keep participating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128491/#Comment_128491" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T08:47:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damian, while "it's what interests us" is true, I think that there is, perhaps, some use to digging deeper into why it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nMiles, while your definition may be true locally for some purposes, I think that there's definitely more to what we think of as fantasy than that there are fantastical elements. And I think it's useful to look at that more limited definition, to get at the crux of what the thread is looking for. For if fantasy is just fiction with fantastic elements, then there's not much more to say. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo digging deeper into "fantasy that includes magic" or some other smaller definition, I think there is something that most posters are missing. First, while I agree that fantasy can be useful in creating distance, or in enabling escapism, I don't think these are very specific to fantasy. I think you can get quitte a lot of escapism out of very realistic fiction, in fact. Consider light romance novels. They can include nothing at all fantastic, yet be very escapist. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd distance from the thematic matter can be done simply with subtle writing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, fantasy perhaps makes these things easier in some ways, sure, but that's not the same as saying that's the most important reason we use fantasy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Tolkien's biggest fan, prolly. But I think with good reason. He was pretty brilliant. I am also, perhaps relatedly, a believer in Joseph Campbell's exposition on the nature of these subjects. Paul hits very close to it, IMO, above: myth is how we explicate our beliefs about the nature of meaning in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nScience Fiction, especially if you accept Assimov's clarifications about the genre, is a very different animal (and Shock is the only real "Speculative Fiction" game out there). As "speculative fiction," fantastical elements and play can fall into this subset. But they don't always. Just as it was (correctly) pointed out above that Star Wars is fantasy, and not Science Fiction, its true that the point of fantasy is to look at myths like the Hero's Journey. This is what Campbell was always saying about Star Wars. While the point of Speculative Fiction is to examine "What if?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn actual play of fantasy RPGs, I think you get a bit of each. At the risk of getting all theoryish here, I think that Sim play is often about exploring the "what if magic were real" stuff of fantasy, or the like. But at the level of theme (narrativism), what play in fantasy is about is in using the "primeval world of possibility" to create whatever theme we need to create. That is, if you want to have a worldwide flood, to examine themes like those of the biblical account of Noah, you can do so in a fantasy environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you happen to be playing more escapist, you might not touch on value themes all that heavily. But the aforementioned observation that fantasy makes it easy to embody things like good and evil simply means that you have an easy facility to deal with these things on precisely as deep a level as you prefer to deal with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, Sci-Fi is (no surprise) more of a scientific approach to play... experimental observation. Fantasy is more of a spiritual approach to play... what do I believe that cannot be proven by observation? What is good/evil? <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it's true that either form of play can occur in the other genre. One can explore spirituality with sci-fi trappings (Star Wars). One can explore "what if" with fantasy trappings. I think that each of these is just slightly more of an uphill battle. Or, rather, Fantasy is the easiest way to discuss theme. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider Ron's statement in Sorcerer that it's important that there be no rational explanation for where demons come from. That's because the game is not supposed to be "what if there were demons?" but instead "what would a person who summoned a demon do with that power?" <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128958/#Comment_128958" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T03:05:35+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  3:05AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the role of play : <a href="url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17play.html?ex=1360904400&amp;en=770521dea96d5610&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">Taking Play Seriously, NY Times</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
