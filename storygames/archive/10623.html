I cheated also one time on the special feature table and one time on the new group table. But I dint cheat on important dice rolls, like when the adventurer delved into the dungeon or in monsters group encounters. <br/><br/>Once you cheat, do you start cheating more often? Me, I think I still try to keep my cheating minimal once I have done it once (if I care about the game).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235487/#Comment_235487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T07:59:28+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  7:59AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cheat.<br/><br/>Not a lot, but I do.

In the past, however, I would sometimes cheat if the opposite meant having to do a lot of stuff over again.  Say that the roll says my character dies 3/4 of the way through a solo adventure, and I'd have to do the whole thing again?

My theory is that you only need to cheat when the game's rules are not in line with what you're trying to get out of the game as a player. I don't cheat in computer games, though, so apparently there's a convenience factor as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235503/#Comment_235503" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-04T09:38:27+00:00" title="October  4, 2009  9:38AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2009 9:39AM by nemomeme.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never cheated in those little paragraph T&amp;T solo games.  There wasn't enough replay value to justify cheating in something like "Goblin Lake."  $2.95 represented a huge chunk of my allowance in 1979.<br/><br/>I used to cheat in Barbarian Prince, but I would have to give myself permission to do so.  Like, if I told myself, "No cheating this game," then no cheating.  But I wanted to see more possible outcomes and increase my chances of getting further sometimes I would say, "Okay, one cheat this game," or "Two cheats this game" for allowed re-rolls.<br/><br/>Hmmm...  Fate/Hero Points were invented by me in 1981, and were originally called "Cheats."  ;-p                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235988/#Comment_235988" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T17:02:47+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  5:02PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2009 5:03PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I avoid cheating. I've cheated once in the past 7 years, and it felt like a knife. I did it because one player kept blowing rolls on dailies in 4E, and this was like the 5th blown roll in a row and it missed the defense by one. So I said it was a hit when it wasn't. This is clearly I sign I need to institute a house rule to allow players rerolls or roll bonuses, perhaps with Aspects, so I will be doing that so I won't feel the compulsion again.<br/><br/>I never cheat in solo games though. Absolutely no reason to. I can fine tune everything to fit the single player. It's much easier. I also pick systems (Nobilis, HeroQuest, and WoD being favorites) that don't have high whiff factors or require character optimization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
