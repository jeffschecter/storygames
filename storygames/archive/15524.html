It's that time of the year again, and I'm taking over for Kat and Michael as the Indie Games Explosion organizer for Dreamation! Dreamation 2012 will be held at the Morristown Hyatt in Morristown, NJ from Thursday, February 23 to Sunday, February 26, 2012. Will you be there? Do you dare to have that much fun?<br/><br/>There will be an Indie Games Explosion at Dreamation. The Explosion always features dozens of the very best indie games and dozens of the best indie game GMs and designers running them.<br/><br/>The Explosion needs your help! We need you to come to the con and play games. We need you to come to the con and RUN games! Here\u2019s how:<br/><br/><b>Come and play</b><br/>If you just want to come to Morristown and have a blast, here\u2019s how you can help make the Explosion great:<br/><br/>1) Go to the <a href="http://www.dexposure.com/d2012i.html" rel="nofollow">registration page</a> and pre-register for the con.<br/>2) Watch this thread for announcements of what events people are planning to run.<br/>3) When the official schedule is up, around February 14-16, register for the games you want to play.<br/>4) Come to Morristown and bring your A-game!<br/><br/><b>Come and run</b><br/>The nitroglycerin at the heart of every Indie Games Explosion are all the great folks who come out with a game in hand, ready to rock the house. If you\u2019ve got a game session in your soul, burning to get out, here\u2019s how you can help:<br/><br/>1) Post your event description here, or on your blog, or wherever the kids are chattering these days. Get people excited about your game.<br/>2) Send an e-mail to my gmail account: brennanrtaylor. At that point, I will send you a Google document that contains all the information we need from you in order to officially register the event. Fill it out and return it BEFORE January 25, 2012.<br/>3) If you run at least three events, you will receive a GM badge to the convention. At some point in January, we will send you a code you can use on the registration page.<br/>4) When the official schedule is up, around February 13-14, register for the games you want to play.<br/>5) Come to Morristown and revel!<br/><br/><b>A Note on Small Events</b><br/>Games sessions for 4 players are a bit of a sticky situation. On the one hand, they take up an entire table for an entire gaming slot while only entertaining a few people. On the other hand, some of the best indie games are only built for 4 and create less fun for everybody if expanded.<br/><br/>Like last year, I\u2019m going to ask you to consider running sessions for 5 or 6 players. By \u201cconsider,\u201d I don\u2019t mean \u201cyou must\u201d or \u201cyou should\u201d or \u201cyou will be shunned unless.\u201d I simply mean \u201cthink about it.\u201d Step away from the Internet for a moment, look at your game shelf, and ask yourself if you have a 5 or 6 player game you\u2019ve been wanting to run. Can you stretch your abilities in that direction? Do you want to? Can you run Game A for 6 players in addition to running Game B for 4 players?<br/><br/>I can\u2019t answer those questions. I\u2019d just like you to answer them for yourself and your own situation. If the answer is \u201cI want to run a bunch of 4 player games,\u201d then that\u2019s fine and we want you on-board for the Explosion.<br/><br/><b>Playtests</b><br/>Dreamation is a great place for games-in-development to get put through their paces. Not only is it easy to get people you don\u2019t know to sign up for the game you\u2019re working on, but some of the sharpest game designers will be there looking for new games to test.<br/><br/>If your game isn\u2019t done, but you think it is at a point where it can probably entertain people for 3 to 4 hours, then register it as a regular event. Just please include the word \u201cPlaytest\u201d in your event description.<br/><br/>If your game isn\u2019t done, and you don\u2019t know whether it works at all, it\u2019s probably not ready to run as a regular event. However, don\u2019t lose hope! Post about it here and see if people are interested. It\u2019s easy to arrange an informal playtest session at Dreamation, where a bunch of people meet in the lobby or a hotel room and give your game a workout, or make sure to put Metatopia on your calendar for 2012. Metatopia is run in November and is specifically designed for games in playtest or games before they are even ready for playtest.<br/><br/><b>Assorted Other Stuff</b><br/>I\u2019m posting this on Story Games, but there\u2019s probably other places on the Internet that might want to get involved. If you know of such a place, please invite them to participate. The more, the merrier.<br/><br/>None of the above is set in stone. If you\u2019ve got suggestions, I want to hear them. I'll be doing my best to monitor these threads for questions and the like. However, if I haven\u2019t responded in timely fashion, please e-mail me at brennanrtaylor on gmail with a link to the question. Thanks for your help.<br/><br/>See you in February!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352011/#Comment_352011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T06:12:36+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  6:12AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should be there.

They play great in a convention environment, but they don't seem to be popular enough to avoid me spending a few blocks sitting at an empty table.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Some other games from off the indie beaten path, like Vajra enterprises Tibet. I'm less certain about how that'll play out at a convention or if it'll be popular enough, but at least I'm getting some other folk's games (hopefully) played.<br/><br/>C) I could run or facilitate some current or past indie darlings. Like running Inspectres or facilitating Fiasco. <br/><br/>I'll figure out what option(s) I take soon enough, but I'd welcome suggestions or advice.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352064/#Comment_352064" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-20T16:11:46+00:00" title="December 20, 2011  4:11PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaaaaah!

You are part of the crew of the USS Bairoko during secret H-bomb tests in the South Pacific near Bikini Atoll. In the aftermath of the first detonation, inexplicable anomalies disrupt shipboard operations, and it is up to you to unravel the eldritch mystery at their core.<br/><br/>Title: Annals of Allohistory<br/>Game: The New World<br/>No. Players: 2-4<br/>Description: Adventure in a New World that never was! In this game, you collaboratively create a mashed-up quasi-historical setting prompted by the oracular meanings assigned to a deck of cards. Your character must then face the perils and possibilities of that setting, with consequences for the ultimate fate of the New World as well as for your character\u2019s own individual destiny. Will you find fame or obscurity? Happiness or regret? And what will you bequeath to those who come after you? Freedom and prosperity? Or oppression and poverty? Your choices will leave a legacy for generations to come. Playtest.<br/><br/>Title:  The Justice Trade<br/>Game: Ashen Stars<br/>No. Players: 3-5<br/>Description: These days, what's left of the pan-species interstellar government called the Combine pays people like you to enforce the law among the scattered frontier planets out in the Bleed, while the bureaucrats back on the central worlds try to rebuild a semblance of the utopia they lost when the Mohilar attacked. Now the war's over, even if no one is quite sure how or why, and you and your crew of freelance effectuators patrol the edge of civilized space, trying to pay the bills while you keep the peace. But the competition in this line is fierce, and sometimes you have to cut corners--which makes you wonder if justice bought and paid for is any justice at all.<br/><br/>Title: Mustering Out Blues<br/>Game: Traveller [GDW]<br/>No. Players: 2-6<br/>Description: You've just mustered out of Imperial service, and you're back in Mandala sub-sector, a few jumps away from the backwater planet you joined the Imperium to get away from. You've got enough cash on your chip to last you a while, but eventually the money's going to run out. So if you don't want to wind up spending your last credit for a low passage back to the homeworld you never wanted to see again, you're going to have to hustle to find the sort of work your years among the stars have equipped you to do. Like the song says: You've got the mustering out blues, my friend, and you've got them bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353073/#Comment_353073" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-03T18:04:40+00:00" title="January  3, 2012  6:04PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perversely, I plan to run *two* games, just so that I have to pay to get in.  <br/><br/>One will ("will" in a "pending acceptance" sense) be a session of Misspent Youth - since Rob is going to run two sessions with pre-fab elements, I'll probably run it old skool and have the players make up the situation and Authority from scratch.

You do not know who built it, but it is in disrepair. There are books, in the wreck of the library, several kilometers beyond the darkened hallway, that you have read, though they reek of urine from those who do not value such things, that show pictures that look like your home and name them as places of punishment. But if that is what it is, you do not know your crime, or that of your parents, or your parents' parents, that brought you here. There are tribes, and wars in the darkness, and pits of human and inhuman filth, and strange pristine white corridors. There are places where frightened slaves tend moldy hydroponic tanks and places of silence and bright light where food simply appears when no one is looking. Somehow, you have made a life here, such as it is. You hate your enemies, and love your friends, and question your allies, just as the books say it has always been.<br/><br/>But now there are rumors of pilgrims coming to your corner of The Cage. Maimed refugees from far beyond where you have explored say they have a leader named Merciful, and that he promises redemption. He sweeps away those who resist and promises the truth to those who will follow him to The Spike. They say that you will be forgiven if you submit, for all that you have done to be here. The hordes are coming. They will be here soon. You can hear their voices ringing in the walls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353856/#Comment_353856" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T02:39:52+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  2:39AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, everyone, thanks for all the interest in the Indie Games Explosion!

I had some great playtests at Metatopia, so I'm looking forward to testing out my revisions. Here's a quick blurb about the game:<br/>\n<br/>\n"You are a group of ordinary people who are in an extraordinary circumstance. You are stranded on a remote location with no way of contacting the outside world. Your resources are limited and it\u2019s clear that time is against you. How will you survive? You can pool resources to try to stave off the inevitable. Or you can fend for yourself, hoping that you\u2019ll be able to outlast everyone else. It\u2019s likely only one of you will make it out. Who will it be?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been working on polishing gameplay...getting things up running faster. I may pre-select scenarios for the Con...though I think it's kind of fun to let the table decide what predicament the characters are in. At Metatopia, characters were members of the mafia, stranded in Siberia as they tried to steal a train full of gold. It was fun, but lots of casualties. I'm itching to pull in a Cthulhu setting, but I'm not sure how it might work. In any case...I'm excited to run it again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355282/#Comment_355282" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T16:49:07+00:00" title="January 21, 2012  4:49PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is my list of games for Dreamation:<br/><br/>Title:  Mean Times in Mankara<br/>Game:  Burning Wheel Gold<br/>Players: 3-5<br/>Description:  A holiday masquerade ball is marred by a murder that threatens to destroy Mankara, the Great City.

If you haven\u2019t played before, remember that a good session starts out desperate and insane and proceeds there in an endless cycle of accusation, jealousy, and desperation until everyone is either seriously messed up or dead. If you come out of this mess free and clear, you\u2019re one of the lucky few. So join us!

Even as their rulers feud and struggle amongst themselves in Iberia, the Portuguese invader dominates the South American region we now know as Brazil, strangling the native American tribes and working their cruel plantations with kidnapped and enslaved West and Central Africans. The only beacon of freedom in a hell that masquerades as civilization comes from the quilombos: hidden fortresses in the Amazon rainforest's depths where free Africans and Amerindians study the martial arts, stockpile weapons, and stage daring raids and guerrilla campaigns against the European oppressor.<br/><br/>Now, in the wake of the great African King Ganga Zumba's demise, Armageddon is close at hand. The Portuguese have summoned their generals and massed their artillery for a final crusade to exterminate the quilombos' resistance once and for all. Can you halt the European advance and change the course of history forever, saving the nascent Brazil from herself?

You realize you now have a chance to fix things - to prepare the world to expel its doom before it awakens again.<br/><br/>MHZ is an over the top game of anachronous technology, occult monsters and their Nazi counterparts, and the action heroes of the past saving the world from dooms they don't realize await them. You play characters from the present or future who are powerful enough and crazy enough to take on Things That Man Wasn't Meant To Know. Will you survive with you minds intact?<br/><br/>Game: <b>Sombra Console</b><br/>Title: <i>The Price of TNChina</i><br/>Description: Sombra Console is a game/setting in the style of Lady Blackbird. It has a fun system that rips out the best of cyberpunk games like Shadowrun and Technoir and provides an easy framework for creating top grade operators along with a megalopolis setting with the complexity of Ghost in the Shell fused with Snow Crash.<br/><br/>The operators owe their patron a big favor and grudingly agree to be \u2018loaned out\u2019 to an up and coming FOQNE: TNChina (Taiwan/Nepal/China) to help them collect critical information on their competitors. The job will be tough, and the enemies you make may outweigh what you think you owe your patron. Keep an eye out for the real players and you might be able to find a way through this mission alive and happy.<br/><br/>This is a futuristic world of governments who act like corporations, man and machines blurring the lines of individualism and the soul, where nothing matches the propaganda/marketing and where the best answer is usually to go on just one more mission.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356699/#Comment_356699" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T06:28:49+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  6:28AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This really is shaping up to be the best Dreamation ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356718/#Comment_356718" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T08:40:49+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  8:40AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, man.

I've got one session of...<br/><br/><b>Game: Project Ninja Panda Taco!</b><br/>Title: Minions, Masterminds and a Three Step Plan<br/><br/>Description: "Project Ninja Panda Taco is a collaborative story telling game where each player attempts to take over the world with their mastermind, prevent their nemesis from succeeding and try to help others with their minion. This game is outlandish, zany and megalomaniacal.<br/><br/>Any mastermind can try to take over the world but only the smartest, devious, and craziest masterminds succeed. Each mastermind creates and tries to accomplish his three step plan before his nemesis gets in the way. Not every mastermind will succeed as there can only be one who will conquer the world."<br/><br/>This is my friend Jennisodes Jenn's game and it's amazing. This thing is still in development but very well polished. It's like Fiasco for evil masterminds, and absolutely perfect for any imaginative kids that might be at the show. I'm not the only one running it, so if you can't get into my session there will definitely be other times to pick up a quick game.<br/><br/>And I'll be running two sessions of...<br/><br/><b>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying</b><br/>Title: Breakout<br/>Description: "The Avengers: disbanded in the wake of a terrible tragedy. The Raft: A maximum-security superprison run by SHIELD and loaded with the most powerful and vile villains the Marvel Universe has ever faced. The Dilemma: Electro is just moments away from destroying the security system and unleashing all of those supercriminals on an unsuspecting New York City. The Solution: You. <br/><br/>Hear the call. Become a hero. Be one of the first to play the Marvel Heroic Roleplaying from Margaret Weis Productions, in this variation of the launch party event! Take on the role of Captain America, Iron Man, Wolverine, or one of the other heroes who answers the call. Hero data files will be provided, as will dice and all other components."<br/><br/>My excitement for this game is easily Class 1000. I got in touch with Cam Banks to see if there was any way I could run this at Dreamation. Cam, being the gracious person he is (or perhaps in an attempt to get the strange man to leave him alone) gave me the go-ahead. This will be the first part of the Breakout adventure set, the same thing that'll be run at FLGSs across the nation as part of the Marvel Heroic launch event. <br/><br/>I cannot wait for this convention.
