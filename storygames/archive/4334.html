Joel is notorious for not prepping and just winging it based on a skeleton of an idea.  He's an accomplished GM and this always results in a fun, if chaotic, time.  Last night was more skeletal than usual - he told us he only had the most elementary ideas and would be relying on us to help him out.  We were game for that!  <br/><br/>So Joel set a scene in medias res and told us to create scenes explaining how it came to be, and what the repercussions would be, as well as resolve the immediate conflict.  Point of attack - we superhero types were with Harrow's brigade, holding the Union line against Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.  The catch, which is what absolutely electrified the session, was that Pickett's suicidal act of bravado was (in our freaky universe) a grand act of Freemason death magic to prepare for the unholy coronation of the King of the West.  So not only did we have to stop the charge, we had to do so without killing a mess of southern boys!  Unalloyed awesome.  <br/><br/>So we started framing flashbacks, and jumping in to play NPCs.  Joel was basically delegating.  In one scene, our spirit-talking death ninja guy snuck into the Confederate HQ and had a conversation with Robert Lee.  I played Lee, and added a bunch of back story, and when a social conflict arose I statted him and rolled for him - I basically assumed GM duties.  In another scene, a PC met with Colonel Lewis Washington, who was a long-term villain in our game, and Steve jumped up to play him, and ran the game for a bit.  We created the story collectively through what amounted to a series of little key scenes, moving forward and backward in time.  <br/><br/>When we flashed forward, we had a little brainstorming session and realized we were sketching out the conclusion of our entire campaign.  Everyone added details - the coronation of the King of the West, a grand conclave of the occult underground, the resurrection of Columbia, Spirit of America, to be the King's bride, the King himself being a descendant of a signer of the Declaration of Independence (and pinpointing a supervillain ex-slave child of Thomas Jefferson who will be perfect for that role).  We agreed that we'd run that next week, and we also agreed - it seemed perfectly natural - that we'd all GM it.  It was a cool moment.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97726/#Comment_97726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T05:21:53+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is some <i>freaky </i>shit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97740/#Comment_97740" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T05:55:35+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:55AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very excellent.

Really, the GM was just the world adding complication and strife and making decisions about penalty dice. With the right set-up at the beginning, I could easily see this working. Basically the way I see it, any player without a PC in the scene just gets to add the complication and strife that a GM used to do. The way I'd handle it is that they'd use a Friend Die when adding a Penalty Die and just give it to the player receiving the Penalty. It makes the Friend Dice an economy <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  And if every PC is in a scene, you don't need any more complication or strife than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97760/#Comment_97760" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T07:08:25+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  7:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris, the way we were playing it would be awkward, unless it was a pure PVP type of scene.  Last night we did have some great conflicts between PCs, but they didn't involve the whole group.  And Joel's character didn't make an appearance (Hamish "The One-Man Army" Bean was sorely missed at Gettysburg).  Next week we'll play it by ear, but with GM duties swirling around freely.  I think in a complex situation involving all the PCs, another player will just step up to provide adversity as needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97763/#Comment_97763" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T07:12:06+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  7:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, there's a crypto-historical fantasy novel somewhere in that story!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97780/#Comment_97780" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T08:01:10+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  8:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's totally hot, Jason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97784/#Comment_97784" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T08:11:43+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  8:11AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which causes me to wonder: Do you think this kind of stuff can be bottled?

We all agreed to come up with a couple for next week, with the expectation that not all of them would be brought into play.  I really like the normal distribution of authority in TSOY and find that it works great, particularly when you rotate that authority every few weeks.

It was a fun thing to experiment with, but as Jason said, it'll probably be an isolated event.  I think the strength of having a regular GM, or even a rotation of GMs that run for several sessions at a stretch, is that it gives the game a more consistent rhythm.  This is especially true in a long-run game.  Changing GMs with each new scene is frenetic and exciting, but I think it would wear thin over multiple sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
