The process starts when your franchise hits zero dice. You can't really "lose" any more dice than you started with, but the minute you hit zero you need to stop and resolve the issue. <br/><br/>First, you can no longer use your cards. All you have is the bank. You willingly go into debt (take out a loan) by placing up to 10 dice of "debt" into the bank. These are like negative franchise dice and you should track them (e.g. the franchise is at "- 6"). You continue a mission and try to earn new dice, with only your bank dice as a resource. (Be careful! One bad roll can blow all that borrowed money without reducing your debt!) At the end of the mission you have to "pay off" those negative dice first. If you end up with some leftover dice after paying off your loan, congrats. Your franchise is back in the black. If not, then you are still in debt. You can take out another loan, but eventually (group decision I think) your creditors close your doors.<br/><br/>Go back and read page 58 again. While it may not be explicit, the general concept is pretty well spelled out in the second to fourth paragraphs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271991/#Comment_271991" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T08:22:38+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  8:22AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: docholaday</cite>The process starts when your franchise hits zero dice.</blockquote>\nGreat.

If you can't imagine how all the dice could get used up, I'm guessing this is the case. My answer to this is that players aren't undergoing enough stress in the game. They need to be pushed to spend more dice.<br/><br/>I GM this game fairly often and, as the GM, your job is to encourage players to engage with the system (especially confessionals), to help them "own" the fiction by throwing the "what happens" back in their laps, to track all the logistics (mission dice and stuff), and to manage the economy of the game by causing stress!<br/><br/>Stress is really the only way the GM gets involved in the fiction. And its the primary means by which he or she can control the economy of the game (the pacing too, to some extent). The fiction is less interesting and achievements are hollow if there is no struggle. Sometimes you let players get high on the dice, especially when they are being awesome and you don't want to interfere. Other times you grind their resources down to make things interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272016/#Comment_272016" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T10:39:08+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 10:39AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Troy has the right of it.  If you're not having this issue in your game, you're not dealing out enough Stress.<br/><br/>Here's how it works.  When the players get a lot of Stress their Stats go down.  When their Stats go down they have depend on their Franchise dice to succeed mid-mission.  Basically, with enough Stress the players aren't relying on the Franchise dice because they want a higher *chance* of success, they're depending on their Franchise dice so that they have *any* chance of success.  And on top of that, they need to spend what Franchise dice they earn to recover their Stats and with enough Stress they won't have enough dice to BOTH recover their Stats in full AND re-invest in the company.<br/><br/>To see that happen you really need to be about as cold and unforgiving with Stress as you can manage.  My rule of thumb is this: If, as the GM, I have to introduce something new into the fiction, it causes Stress.  That generally happens under two cases:<br/><br/>1) There's a lull in the action and I have to "spike" things to keep things going.  <br/>2) The player's fail a roll.<br/><br/>Basically, if I'm talking, there's Stress.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272099/#Comment_272099" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T15:25:08+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  3:25PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK. Thanks for the comments, everyone, but I guess I'm not making myself clear.  My question is a technical rules one, not a GMing-best-practice one.  <br/><br/>At the start of play, the franchise has some dice in cards and in the bank.  During play, the PCs acquire franchise dice through skill rolls, use card/bank dice for augments, and have skills lowered through stress.  At the end of the mission (whether successful or not), the franchise has some franchise dice to spend.  They can spend it replenishing the cards/bank, buying Cool dice, or paying for vacations (to recover stress penalties).  The implication is that all franchise dice earned are spent in this way and the players have free choice in how they spend their earnings.  <br/><br/>Given this cycle, how can a franchise become bankrupt?  Is it purely when the all the cards and the bank have zero dice after the earned franchise dice are spent?  If that's the case, what's the reason for doing so, rather than one person foregoing one recovered die on vacation, keeping one die on a card, and repeatedly doing two-dice missions followed by one-point vacations?<br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272102/#Comment_272102" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T15:32:01+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  3:32PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it happens when a player wants (needs) to use a franchise die <i>during</i> the mission, but they're all gone.

It even makes sense.  One question, though.  Page 58 says that, as a result of going bankrupt (i.e. losing all your franchise dice), the group loses access to all its cards.  That implies that bankruptcy can occur while the cards are still available for use, i.e. have dice on them.  If, as you say, bankruptcy only occurs when there's nothing on the cards, there's no need to say you don't have access to them.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to think that the trigger condition for bankruptcy is a holdover from an earlier iteration of the mechanics.<br/><br/>Neil.</blockquote>\n<br/>I'm beginning to think you guys went full retard. Never go full retard.<br/><br/>It just means you can't go into debt and then refill your cards with dice.

At the end of a mission, I can't allocate more franchise dice than I've earned into bank/cards/vacation.  I'm never forced to use dice from bank/cards.  So I can see no occasion where 'debt' (i.e. negative dice) would ever occur.<br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

The Bank floods with debt dice that can not be transferred to any of the other cards (that's why they are "locked").
