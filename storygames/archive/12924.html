Then I worked on the system a little more in accordence with the feedback I received from you and resubmitted it on reddit.com/rpg and received even more feedback. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter these, I decided to share it with more people and registered a domain for the system and built a tiny, one-page website. You can visit it over http://www.pierpg.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, before I go "version 1.0" I need some volunteers that are interested in playing with PIE system with their homebrewed and/or paid-for campaign settings. What I ask of you is to give PIE a try with your party, -a one-shot game maybe- and send me an email including feedback in general or divided into "Storyteller" and "player" sections. Even 5 or 6 parties offering feedback is enough but as you know the more the merrier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this stage I cannot offer you much but I can include your name in the rulebook as beta tester/contributor (whichever you like) and maybe a hard copy of the setting I'm working on for the PIE system, which I'm going to release over pierpg.com for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested, please contact me over dullbarbarian@gmail.com <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
