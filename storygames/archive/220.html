<p>(I'm posting here rather than on Vincent's forum because there's lots of non-Dog-specific content I want to unwrap.)</p>
<p>So here's the scene last night: we got together and wrapped up a town which we really had mostly done last session anyhow (except for the the hope of something of a climax). The only conflict, which was supposed to be the <em>boss</em>, was with against a 15-year-old kid with an axe who refused to actually swing the axe against the Dogs. There was lots of scenes of talking and dialoguing, sometimes without a clear focus to it. Once we finished this town, I tried running some "vignette" scenes of a travel montage, but I couldn't come up with anything. Our seemingly climactic player-vs-player conflict more or less fizzled, with the stakes changing half-way through. At least half the dice were building dice pyramids at any given time. And I was really exhausted.</p>
<p>The best decision I made all night was that I just ended the session early, deciding to have more prep down for next time, but I did feel bad about that. I mean, none of the <em>other</em> GMs have had to do that, right? So I'm trying to look at what happened.</p>
<p>Mitigating factors: I'm still a relatively neophyte GM. This is only my second long-term campaign I've ever run (despite having done lots of one-shots). I was also somewhat tired at the time, so I didn't have the creative juice to overcome the problems that were already at the table.</p>
<p>I also screwed myself big time by not doing enough prep, and in fact doing scarcely any. Hence, I only could come up with one conflict to finish out the town in question, and I couldn't come up with enough hooks to ad lib more. I still have a hard time of understanding when I have "enough" prep on paper - any good suggestions to help keep me on the ball here? (Maybe "prep" is just another skill that needs developing.)</p>
<p>Another problem: I didn't figure myself enough escalation room into the game. Escalating a situation is one of the key tools in a Dogs-GM's toolkit, but I didn't have any good avenues here for making that happen credibly in the fiction. I thus didn't push too hard, and let the players more or less walk through the events of the town. If I would do it over, I would have added more and more opportunities for valid escalation.</p>
<p>But this is a recurring problem I have as well: I simply haven't been comfortable yet making the conflicts as bloody-minded as they should have been, and I've had a bad habit of creating "softball" towns so far, which is of no help to anyone. I don't know why, but I didn't feel like it made enough sense for this child antagonist, in this case, to get up and murderous to the point of standing a real challenge against a real Watchdog. To some extent, I wasn't 100% sure I wanted to see that happen. I'm not sure what's going on there. (I should add that this town in question was one I pulled of the internets, rather than building from scratch.)</p>
<p>Another pattern that happen with my group that concerns me: tendency towards very lengthy character dialogues that can't be translated into the conflict system. I'm by no means trying to bound discussion or dialogue only within the conflict system, but there are times where this has simply slowed the rhythm down a great deal. I had this long stretch where one of the Dogs more or less monologued to the opposing sides about why they were bad and wrong, and I couldn't think of a way to translate this into a meaningful conflict. There was no real stakes happening (simply a character getting some spotlight time) and I couldn't peg any down. The only escalation I could see was the opposing sides maybe jumping up at each others throats or something, but that felt far too contrived.</p>
<p>One Dogs-specific problem I'm having: It's clear that these protagonists have some clear authority over most people they meet, including the Stewards of each town. As a result, I find that many of my NPCs end up buckling to whatever the Dogs say, after they've gotten a stern talking to. But that's ridiculous! I feel that I must have worked myself into some logical loop. What's wrong with my logic here? Am I simply making my antagonists "too good"?</p>
<p>Any further advice or analysis into what happened? I'm already trying to prep some better ideas for the next session, but I'm also a bit bummed at things having turned out so weakly this time.</p>

                            Dev, I think you might have done <em>too much</em> prep.  You're talking about NPCs who "would never" do things, about not leaving yourself space for escalation, about talking without conflicts.  This says to me that you're creating a lot more details in your head and then trying to make them come out in play.<br/><br/>The only thing you need to prep for Dogs is the Town Creation sheet with the Proto-NPCs.<br/><br/>As to your NPCs and their willingness to get all bloody-minded, refer back to what they want out of the Dogs.  That is their <em>only motivation in the world</em>.  If Sister Prudence wants to not be married to her husband and the Dogs don't annul her marriage for her, she will try to kill her husband.  She doesn't want to stay within standards of appropriate behavior, she doesn't want to seem like a good person to her neighbors, she doesn't want to provide a good life for her children.  Those are other motivations.  The only motivation she has is to get the hell out of her husband's household.<br/><br/>Are you introducing NPCs that don't appear on the Sin Hierarchy?  They're nothing; they're chaff.  Skip 'em.  They have nothing to say and nothing to do.  They're furniture.  Don't name them, don't stat them.  (The Steward might be an exception, here.)<br/><br/>You seem to imply that you needed to figure out what conflicts you were going to run in the town.  Stop.  Do not try and figure out what the characters are going to do before you sit down at the table.  Your job is to create a fucked-up situation and then present it to the players.  That's it.  What the players do is up to them, and you do <em>not</em> need to "prep" for any of it.  If they're interacting with someone who relates to the Sin Hierarchy, assign a name to a Proto-NPC.  If they're not, say Yes, Give, move on.<br/><br/>If a player is doing something for more than thirty seconds (yes, thirty seconds) ask them what they're trying to accomplish.  That's their stakes for the conflict.  You either say Yes and move on or start rolling dice.  Harraunging the Faithful is only entertaining when you're trying to convince them that you're right and they're mouthing off.                        </div>

                            Joshua's advice sounds good. One of the hardest thing for new GMs to learn is what you don't actually need to do, and this varies a lot by game, group, and situation. He's particularly on when it comes to leaving room for escalation. If you set up a character who <i>cannot</i> do something, for whatever reason, then you have to be preapred for a situation to arise where the character needs to, cannot, and must therefore break. (I'm riddling the vampiric hierarchy of my World of Darkness Seattle with characters who have such compulsions precisley because I do want it to explode in a way whose details will surprise me as well as the players.) <br/><br/>One more thing: be honest with your players, and they will generally be kind in return. If you say, "sorry, I kinda froze, but I got some good feedback and I want to finish this in grand style", players worth bothering with will be there for you.                        </div>

                            Also don't fret the part where players are monologuing and role-playing amongst themselves and with you and the NPCs. They obviously have some stuff they want to do. If it is boring to you or other players, though, that's a problem. If you're all having fun? That's awesome. The players will find conflict sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
In the scene with the "15-year-old kid with an axe," what Stakes did you define?<br/>
<br/>
If you felt conflict wasn't coming to the game naturally, it's possible your Town wasn't "grabby" enough. The last scene with the "boss" (presumably the cause of all the trouble in town, or the leader of a false priesthood or something, maybe even a sorcerer) should be pretty exciting. In my mind, you're asking the players if they'll kill a teenager for the things he's done. Why wasn't he swinging the axe? There's one way to escalate. You're saying, "You won't hurt the boy if he's just talking and waving an axe? What if he starts swinging it at your head like a crazed lunatic? What if he tries to kill an innocent baby? Huh? How about now?" Why did you limit escalation unnecessarily by making him not swing the axe?<br/>
<br/>
And let's say the Dogs apprehend him without bloodshed. By this time, they should have a pretty complete mental checklist of Pride, Injustice, Sin, Demonic Attacks, False Doctrine, Corrupt Worship, False Priesthood, Sorcerery, Hate, and Murder -- or however far your town goes (and I recommend all the way for a new GM). The players have this huge list of things people did wrong and now it's time to clean up town. How do the Dogs punish people, if at all? Doesn't have to be a conflict and dice rolling here; the discussion and role-playing and judgment is fun -- and, presumably, what the game is all about.                        </div>

</div></blockquote>
<p>I didn't try statting up unnecessary characters at this stage, at least. I was still keeping the characters loosely defined up until play, where I tried to drive them with their issues and see where that took them. But once I've established something of who they are (in the fiction of the world, in terms of what the players have actually seen) this sometimes leaves me with less room to plausibly escalate. For example, perhaps I've roleplayed the Steward for a bit, and while he's conflicted with the Dogs already he I've portrayed him as specifically normal soul. His disagreements with the Dogs aren't worth losing his station or attacking the Dogs themselves. I suddenly feel like I need to escalate this conflict, but I can't figure out how to do it plausibly. I'm trying to avoid a case like "Steward McHappy decides that he should eat meat on a Monday - and he draws his Demon Guns!"</p>
<p>I'm starting to see some of the trouble above, though. What's the Steward's role in the Pride/Sin progression? I've made a mistake in some of my Town Creation with conflating a mere disagreement with actual problems of Pride/Sin. Bruce's suggestion (that a person who cannot do what he "needs" to will break down) is helpful in this regard: the issues involving the NPCs need to be central enough that they will change everything else about themselves in order to get what they need. (That's what makes it a real problem, rather than just a disagreement.) If the Steward above is so gung-ho about a heathen diet that he's willing to ignore all his other duties, the problem is starting to sound a lot more Dogs-relevant.</p>
<p>This also reminded me of another problem:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>And let's say the Dogs apprehend him without bloodshed. ... The players have this huge list of things people did wrong and now it's time to clean up town. How do the Dogs punish people, if at all?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I've spent no time at all dealing with much of the <em>aftermath</em> of a conflict situation, including the punishment and the animosity afterwards. In fact, all of my sessions so far have been in more-or-less "real time", with the action taking place over a single day. I'm starting to see places where, if I just let a few days pass, there would be room for normally "reasonable" people to start obsessing with their Sin and to escalate matters. Perhaps this was the problem I was having? I can't credibly get this Steward violent within two hours of having met him, but I can give him a day to stew on his disappointment and more believably escalate his Pride/Sin. (Am I on the right rack?)</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>In the scene with the "15-year-old kid with an axe," what Stakes did you define?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The kid has left another man trapped in a contraption; the Stakes were "Do you free the captive?" and the kid was firmly opposed. Leading up to these stakes was some normal dialogue where I imply came off as meek (this may have been my fatigue in play?) such that he answered requests to free the captive with "I don't know" rather than "Get the hell away". The conflict began, and the 3 Dogs quickly pushed him aside, took away his axe, and caught his attacks when he started throwing a punch. It was sort of sad, really.</p>
<p>The Stakes were enough to get the kid involved (are the Dogs willing to maim him in order to get past him?) but I could muster up the idea to push the kid into attempted murder just now. If I would do it over, I would have had the kid come back a few days later with a chip on his shoulder, this time with his Stakes being "Humiliate the Dogs".</p>

                            You might have set the wrong stakes there. "Do you free the captive?" only works if there's significant conflict keeping the Dogs from just walking up and letting him go. A talking kid isn't gonna stop them. What's left?<br/><br/>Without changing the stakes, you could have had the kid standing there, laughing smugly as the Dogs tried to <i>figure out</i> the complex contraption. Maybe the machine is booby-trapped and can harm the Dogs, or better, the captive inside it. "I wouldn't do that if I were you," the kid says with a sneer, "or you'll liable to get poor Jake all mangled up inside. Don't say I didn't warn you." That allows you to do a talking (Non-physical) bit and also go Physical if you want, without even involving a fight with the kid.<br/><br/>This makes the stakes, "Do you free the captive without mangling him?" Juicy!<br/><br/>Otherwise, if you can just walk up and open the door to the contraption without any conflict, Just Say Yes. It's not an interesting conflict, so don't bother rolling dice.                        </div>

<p>Thanks for the advice, all. If it works out, I'll post here (and try to summarize the specifics that I found helpful).</p>
<p>I'm mulling over ideas for the next session, but I definitely think having the kid with the axe return with some issues on his mind, having given him some weeks to dig up his (demon-powered) axe and to obsess over his indignities. I feel that returning to some of those un-escalated issues in the town will help me get over the bumps in the last session. There's clear Pride and Sin involved - he's ready to abandon his faith and actually use Real Violence to get over his own grudge. Since one of the girls of this town is actually travelling with the Dogs now, she will be bringing her own issues back into the fray, making this more or less a two-person town.</p>
