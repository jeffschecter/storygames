Three of the six players were new to the game, the others had played only once or twice. We were continuing along with the first Scales of War module, Rescue at Rivenroar. The PCs had a map to the castle ruins and were following it, but didnt realize the map took them through a Kruthik nest (basically bug-like, bladed lizards who can burrow and who cut you if you stand too close).<br/><br/>So I draw out the map, they set up their pieces, the battle starts. About halfway through, maybe a little further, one of the players gets up and leaves. Walks out. The other players are still going, so one of them just takes over the character actions. The combat lasts a while, but everyone seems engaged and we keep playing.<br/><br/>The one player comes back right as the last Kruthik is being taken down. He is grumbling about the fight, so I wrap things up quickly, put the game stuff away, and we all start to talk. The conversation turns heated on an unrelated topic, and I can tell the guy is pissed, but I dont want to start something in front of everyone else. Eventually we all just leave (it was his house).<br/><br/>Later I call him and proceed to have one of the worst fights ever with him on the phone. Though there apparently were other issues, he told me that the game sucked and it was my fault, that I put them up against to tough of opponents, made no attempt to have any role-playing and that I was a terrible DM.<br/><br/>I told him he didn't even attempt to roleplay and that he walked out without telling me what the issue was.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it was a very bad end to what I thought was an otherwise ok game. Now I have no desire to run anything for this guy, who also said other people who stayed afterwards agreed with him and were pissed at me for not making the game fun for them.<br/><br/>So I am kinda left scratching my head over what to do next, what I did wrong and how this could have turned out differently. I have never had a game where we played through a whole session without issue and then was berated for the game not being what the players thought it should be.<br/><br/>Not really a question here. Just looking for discussion and to vent a bit.<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228893/#Comment_228893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T08:29:31+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  8:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Now I have no desire to run anything for this guy, who also said other people who stayed afterwards agreed with him and were pissed at me for not making the game fun for them.</i><br/><br/>I think it might be worthwhile to seek independent verification of how the other players actually felt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228895/#Comment_228895" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T08:43:32+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  8:43AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 8:46AM by Andy.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>The one player comes back right as the last Kruthik is being taken down.

I've played with these kind of folks before. You're best to cut your losses and move on. <br/><br/>Without knowing in-depth what the session was like, who stayed around after to agree with Angry Dude's assessment, etc. I've had people (ok, two people in pretty much the entirety of my gaming) get really upset with some *thing* that happens that sets them off; Usually a rules argument or something. But then that person stews on it without discussing it, storms off, stays angry and brings that anger into other things (after-game conversation, etc). Pretty much just like you describe. <br/><br/>I had another player who pretty much sabotaged every game he was a part of as soon as something didn't happen "perfectly" as he imagined: That is, everything was fine until the first rules problem/discussion, first character mis-assumption, first time that the GM (me or another) would describe the room wrong ("What do you mean there's candlesticks? You didn't say there were candlesticks before! If I knew that, I would have kicked one of them into the enemy soldiers. SHIT! That fucking ruined EVERYTHING" etc), and it was All Fucking Done; he'd huff and try to stop the game, or if the game would try to go on regardless he'd basically try to ruin it "in character", etc.<br/><br/>In one case, I never invited the player to play again. In the other case, I left the gaming group. In both cases, I quickly was able to re-arrange things to continue gaming with people or with others in a way that left me without a game for *maybe* two weeks.<br/><br/>I deal with high-maintenance people in my high-paying high-stress long-hour zero-flaw-tolerance technical career; when they enter my gaming zone, they're fucking <i>through</i>. I feel you.<br/><br/>There were three people new to gaming, you said? Maybe there's your new group.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><b><br/>EDIT</b>: And what Roger said. In my angry guy <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> scenario (from college), it turned out that "everyone else who was angry at me" were simply humoring the dude leveling the accusations, and were too uncomfortable with him to disagree to his face. The rest of us continued to play on, and had an awesome Grunge Dragonlance campaign.<br/><br/>EDIT 2: And if it turns out that the others did have a problem with your game or your gaming style, awesome. Learn from them, keep an open mind and heart, take their criticism and determine how you can use it to make you better. Still, I'd write off Uncommunicative Angry Guy Who Suppresses His Emotions Until He Explodes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228898/#Comment_228898" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T08:49:31+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  8:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, I agree with Andy.

I think what really bothered me was his idea that I didn't "bring the fun" to the table. I kinda snapped back that it wasn't my job to entertain him, but it did get me thinking of what I could have done differently when I realized he was getting annoyed.<br/><br/>Most of his complaints early on, before he left the table, was bad die rolls, not being able to hit the monsters. But when we talked later his main complaints came down to:<br/><br/>- I wasn't prepared as the game DM because there was no "story" and at the end of the session I said we'd figure up XP and treasure later (I was trying to end the game by that point, which he said was a lame excuse for not being prepared).<br/><br/>- The monsters were too tough, had too many hitpoints, and fighting them was a grind. The module stated (I believe, it isnt in front of me) the threat was a level or two above the heroes. I mentioned this when he said in the game something about the critters taking too many hits. He took this to mean I had thrown too high of a threat at them, and he said as much later.<br/><br/>- The game "sucked" because I as the DM did nothing to make it fun.<br/><br/>I am not trying to dogpile him. Truth be told, he and I likely won't be talking again anytime soon due to other things that were said afterwards, but game wise I just felt blindsided. <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228910/#Comment_228910" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T09:20:06+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  9:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quoting John Wick: "<a href="http://wickedthought.livejournal.com/768971.html" rel="nofollow">Why are you playing with bad [players]?</a>"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228914/#Comment_228914" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T09:33:01+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  9:33AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A similar situation happened to me a few years back.<br/><br/>We were playing with our normal small group of college buds, and during a tomb raid the players ran into a cache of cursed items. The formula was simple: pick a good thing, then a bad thing is rolled in secret.<br/><br/>The results were pretty crippling, but funny nonetheless. One of the players lucked out, in that the Ring of Blinking he found turned him into a woman, but left all his combat stats alone, skills, 10 fingers and 10 toes. It'd make him unrecognizable in town, too; which would definitely be a plus for a rogue.<br/><br/>As I was explaining how cool it was in play that this ring actually wiped away his sinister reputation, he interrupted with "I fall on my sword." I kinda stood for a moment, dumbfounded. We weren't immersed in roleplaying; we were playing the game for the game's sake, having fun with some old school D&amp;D. I'd known the guy for a while, and would never have guessed that something so innocuous would kill his fun.<br/><br/>"I'm not playing <i>as a bitch</i> in my fucking D&amp;D game."<br/><br/>I'm still flabbergasted to this day. I've known the guy the better part of a decade, and in no other aspect of his life does this show up. He's a great husband, a sensitive caring guy, and as open-minded and accepting as you could expect from an educated liberal child of educated liberal parents.<br/><br/>But woe betide the Cursed Ring of Genderbending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228921/#Comment_228921" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T09:44:40+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  9:44AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 9:46AM by Valvorik.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poor behaviour on his part.  The best spin would be "he left table as alternative to exploding", but if he's that close to exploding over this sort of stuff not good anyway.<br/><br/>About that encounter - well the kruthik ambush is pretty much pointless story wise in that adventure - after a series of encounters that are about the plot/story, this is essentially a "random monster".  Even the fact that they usually build their nests near magical energy sources isn't exploited to let PC's find something neat buried nearby if they use their monster knowledge check to realize this fact.  There's no problem with the encounter level wise, it's a level 2 encounter - unless party was run ragged for power uses and healing surges, totally in-scope for even level 1 PCs.<br/><br/>He doesn't have right to complain about "not making it fun" if he didn't try to bring something to table creatively.  If he can't see the fun in roleplaying a run of bad luck he shouldn't be playing a game where luck is involved.  That it's a roleplaying game is the saving grace for bad luck - which in a non-roleplaying game is just pure sucky.  I had my first 4e TPK l;ast week for group of 4th level PC's (well, TP unconscious and captured courtesy of the dying saving rules, they were fighting an evil slavery cult so it was a no brainer their next scene is coming around shackled etc), mostly due to an epic run of bad player luck paired with monster good luck (woo hoo, the minion achers score 4 out 4 hits this round) and nobody is grousing in the least so far (now this is a table where we have discussed that no Players don't want DM fudging dice and that PC death must be an option even though we like these PC's and their stories).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228956/#Comment_228956" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T10:42:21+00:00" title="August 31, 2009 10:42AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>- The monsters were too tough, had too many hitpoints, and fighting them was a grind.

We're all pretty much thinking we're revisiting the awesome fun we used to have with our HERO system set-pieces, with a smaller amount of complexity, shorter prep-time (MUCH shorter prep-time), and a bit more in the way of fun tactical choices.<br/><br/>The other group I play regularly with is formed mostly of long-time 2e and 3e players. They were <i>not</i> jazzed by playing 4e for a few sessions. Their complaints sounded a bit familiar to the "fights are too long! fights are too complicated! there's not enough left to the imagination!" type of observation, but was also accompanied by the observation that this just didn't feel like the game they had fun with, and they weren't fond of the "everyone has powerz!" vibe that's fairly fundamental to 4e. So, we moved back 3e (and will be moving to PFRPG).<br/><br/>That's cool -- some games are not for everyone; but in my 3e group's situation, we tried it, we talked about it, we decided it wasn't for us, and we moved back. Nobody got upset or angry or anything.

The outcome of a fight may be accurately predicted in the first few rounds, but not resolved until much later. In one session of 4E, I declared around round 5 that it was going to take another 5-6 rounds for us to win (and, by implication, that we had essentially no chance of losing). JayWalt skeptically looked at me and asked, 'you think so?' We won on turn 11.<br/><br/>So, yeah, 4E is grindy. Taking turns faster doesn't fix the fact that you know the outcome many turns before the fight is over. <br/><br/>Question for merb101:<br/><br/>You say that, "About halfway through, maybe a little further, one of the players gets up and leaves." What kind time duration are we talking? 30 minutes of play? An hour? The middle of a 4E fight is not an environment that supports hitting pause, so something that happens in the first 5 minutes will tend to fester until the fight ends. That could be a long time, indeed, especially with new players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229063/#Comment_229063" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T15:56:41+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  3:56PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2009 3:57PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>...but was also accompanied by the observation that this just didn't feel like the game they had fun with, and they weren't fond of the "everyone has powerz!" vibe that's fairly fundamental to 4e.

All my Monday Night players complained that it didn't "feel" like a game they'd like, that it was too much "superheroey" and "anime-ish" stuff going on with all the flashy power bits. They were not tremendously precise in their descriptions, or were they really able to put their finger on <i>why</i> they had a sour taste on their mouth: I wasn't dismayed too much by this because being able to enjoy something, and then be able to have a critical vocabulary around it, aren't necessarily the same thing.<br/><br/>I also think they were a little frustrated by the tactical choices they had available: this is a bit of an illusion, I think -- as you point out, 3.x characters tend to have a bit more in the way of knobs and wheels than 4e characters.<br/><br/>In the end, I think the players were turned off by the almost boardgamey, extended string of tactical encounters type feel of 4e and I was more interested in keeping the players happy than painting the entire world with 4e paint, so we switched back.<br/><br/>I was OK with them all saying, essentially, "we're not really keen on this, but we're also not really sure <i>why</i> we're not keen on this".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229377/#Comment_229377" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:05:55+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm really not trying to bash my player, more venting over my frustration. To be honest, my big mistake was not realizing he was getting frustrated, stopping the game and figuring out why. I think he whiffed several rolls early on, and when characters did hit the monsters, it didnt feel like much payoff. Midway through the game he was just phoning it in, and then that wasnt even worth it.<br/><br/>And this was a multi-hour combat, as players figured out how to move, asked questions about powers and sorted out the game. So I can understand it feeling like a grind.<br/><br/>I tried to throw in some story elements, talking about how the monsters moved, making noises to illustrate them, etc, but all of the players, including the frustrated one, talked purely in game terms: Roll to hit, move x squares, combat advantage, at-will, healing surges. There was no "role-playing," and everyone seemed fine with that except him.<br/><br/>My buddy already has made it clear he has no intention to play, and conversations outside of gaming led me to believe there is no real friendship there anymore. Again, the game was the match that lit the fuse, but not the cause of the explosion.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if, for the next time I play, I should immediately reduce monster hit points to half,,, basically reset where they are full strength and bloodied, unless it is a "name" villain?<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229382/#Comment_229382" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:19:41+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:19PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I'm wondering if, for the next time I play, I should immediately reduce monster hit points to half,,, basically reset where they are full strength and bloodied, unless it is a "name" villain?</blockquote>\nI'd also reduce defenses so PCs hit more.

I'm always surprised to hear that a combat continues on to the bitter end after the victor has pretty much been determined.  That's pretty much the dullest part of any fight and you should foreshorten it most of the time.  That provides a similar effect to the house rule you're considering, but without the hit point math.<br/><br/>With the PHB2, WotC added Expertise feats to the game, providing a +1/tier to-hit bonus at the cost of a feat.  They did this to make the game less "whiffy," a trend which increases at the Paragon tier and then again at Epic.  Without Expertise, PCs hit less often as they level towards 30.<br/><br/>I determined to disallow Expertise feats in my game; they are dull and they are so good that every PC wants them, representing a "feat tax" and so every PC effectively has one less feat to differentiate their vision of their character.  But I then levied a -2/-3/-4 to all opponent defenses (by tier), to achieve the same effect and then some.  PCs hit more often as a result and the combat proceeds more quickly.  I also improved opponent damage by +2/+3/+4 for each attack (by tier) to make opposition more scary without adding "swingy" critical house-rules.  The extra damage means I might typically have one or two fewer baddies on the field which makes the combat faster and has a similar effect as reducing hitpoints.  I'm pretty happy with these changes and they are among my few house rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229396/#Comment_229396" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:44:37+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:44PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>All my Monday Night players complained that it didn't "feel" like a game they'd like, that it was too much "superheroey" and "anime-ish" stuff going on with all the flashy power bits.</blockquote>\nNope!

Ask the player to state what his character does<br/>(roll the dice)<br/>2. Ask the player to describe the outcome of his action, including vivid description (or do it yourself, if you narrate)<br/><br/><b>Nevernevernever</b> allow a player to narrate the action before the dice roll, like "I flip around on the balls of my feet, twist my dagger holding his blade, and shove the other up towards his lower intestine". The player spends a lot of creative energy describing awesome actions, <i>with a positive outcome clearly in mind</i>, and then the dice fail to support their narration and the energy drains away. A few of these whiffs and anyone's session will start sucking. However, it's actually fun to describe a failure sometimes, but never fun to expect a success on a cool Encounter or Daily power and end up having to narrate a crappy "miss" result.<br/><br/>Also, all the modules I've seen are made of suck and fail (someone, please, prove me wrong!). I've successfully harvested individual elements from them on occasion, but I've never read a module I that seemed gripping or interesting from a story perspective in any way. Make the players tell you what motivates their characters by announcing Quests, writing magic item shopping lists, or just plain telling you - then craft or steal meaningful encounters to put in their way.<br/><br/>Now, whether you used the above techniques or not, you shouldn't have to put up with passive-aggressive BS like what you're describing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229645/#Comment_229645" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T12:15:24+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:15PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 12:16PM by Jack Aidley.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>Slight point: while everyone gets 'special effects' in 4E from level 1, every single character has fewer options in 4E than in 3E.
