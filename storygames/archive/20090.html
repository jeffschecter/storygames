I'm trying to think of interesting, inclusive ways to play with the disconnect between mind and body and to generate productive dissonance to pose questions and probably generate some productive discomfort like a lot of good science-fiction does. So the questions:<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Questions</span></b>: Please feel free to offer any thoughts or as many, or as few, answers to question as you like, any help and food for thought is much appreciated.<br/><br/>1. How much of identity is based on our body? For example, to the best of my knowledge, a person's sexual identity is mostly housed in the mind, but even if it is, there is definitely a lot about ourselves we have no idea about, so I wonder if it should even be treated as something we're in control of all the time. I really like the idea explored in Monsterhearts about how we can't choose what turns us on; Despite the game being about teenagers, where it's even more so, I don't really think that's something that goes away as you get older, just (maybe) less explored. For example:<br/><br/>In the game, you can't control what person's body you end up in for various reasons, but mainly money and because there just aren't a lot of people anymore. Your body will also have already lived a certain lifetime of experience, so how much should a body's remembered experiences play into it? <br/><br/>2. It would just be a dial, or set of options, that can be explored in play, but what do you think would be the best way to represent this in game? I'm imagining mostly stuff that the GM could introduce as needed in the game, informing players as subtly or not how their body reacts to certain things, or doing certain things unconsciously. Essentially, I was thinking the GM would have a pre-gen of the PC's bodies basically, and part of exploring the setting would also be about exploring their new bodies, and there would be clear lines and conversations about what that entails between players and GM from the start - anywhere from always having a cigarette in your mouth (or the future equivalent) without you even being aware of taking one out and putting it to your lips, to being attracted to a certain gender, having a certain fetish, or being a male in a female body (for example) and what that'd entail, and so on. That brings it to another question for me though:<br/><br/>3. Assuming the player is in control of the mind (having a self-identity already before winding up in a new body), and assuming the GM is given full purview, how far does the body dictate self-identity, and how far does the mind? Essentially, in terms of the game: how much control should the player have over identity, and how much should the GM?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444006/#Comment_444006" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T21:50:19+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  9:50PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An interesting approach to ask these questions in game design instead of leaving them to be explored in play. I'll discuss my own understanding of the theory of the mind a little bit:<br/><br/>I personally subscribe to a pretty deconstructed model of human mind (which I understand to accord with current science on the matter as well). This means that things like the sense of self are emergent incidentals with underlying physical causes that have little or no necessary relationship with our self-perception: we are collections of biological processes and cognitive patterns that do not fulfill the basic assumptions of Cartesian dualism. This is not to say that we aren't ideal beings <i>as well</i>, merely that our physical and ideal existences are very deeply interconnected and not at all dualistic.<br/><br/>On this basis I answer your first question thus: our sense of body identity is a physiological process that can be somewhat modified and heightened or suppressed by mental (neural) direction. This partial control may confuse us into believing that body identity somehow originates in cognition, when in reality there are e.g. brain injuries, inborn dysfunctions and even illnesses that can thoroughly mess up the underlying "sub-conscious" body identification process while higher cognition is seemingly unaffected.<br/><br/>I would expect that a properly developed body-swapping superscience would include successful coordination of the body identification process: when your brain is wired into the new body, surely it is ensured that the brain activates correctly regarding this new body, making it feel like your "own" body to the mind. This would be a smart move, considering the experiences we have in the real world with people whose body identification process goes haywire - it doesn't look good.<br/><br/>So we may assume that the brain is tricked pretty well about being present in its own body. Of course the mind still needs to observe the body and form mental narratives/explanations/observations about who and what the body is; it would also certainly be possible for the mind to keep a certain distance, thinking of "this body" instead of "my body" - that's possible for people in their own bodies without too much trouble, so why not in a loaner! In general the brain should couple with the body correctly, though, given the presumption that this body-swapping process actually works.<br/><br/>The question about sexual identity can be answered on the basis of this framework by drawing attention to certain relatively discernible physical questions. Specifically: where does the body generate sexual impulses, and are they discernibly different between individuals? My understanding of the physical science of it is that sexuality happens almost exclusively in the brain, and there are no special "gay organs" or "female neural pathways" in the body outside the brain; the physiology, such as the neural pathways between the brain and the different parts of the body, is uniformly different between individuals. By "uniformly different" I mean that while there are individual differences, there apparently aren't significant sexual identity markers in there.<br/><br/>What this boils down to physiologically is that I would expect a body-swapped person to e.g. notice that their nipples aren't as sensitive as they used to be or that they now recognize the physical sensation of backrubs in a stronger way than before, but that would not affect what they find sexually exciting in any direct manner - they'd still interpret nipple or backrub stimulation in the same way they used to, even if recognizing the sensation might be somewhat more difficult. Over time they might learn new sexual patterns of thought, perhaps, but that also applies to a person who say loses the use of their legs and has to relearn how they relate to their own body. Nothing new in there, in other words.<br/><br/>Moving on to your second question, I'm pretty familiar with the idea of separating the personal identity of a character in play - I've been doing it in various drama games pretty regularly since 2004 or so, when I started playing <i>Dust Devils</i> (that game with a mechanized subconscious for every character, you know). I even do it in D&amp;D nowadays. The way I usually explain this to the players is that we generally assume that the player's relationship to the character is largely similar to the super-ego's relationship to the ego; this just happens to be a convenient simile, a player has a similarly distanced and cerebral relationship to the character as the relationship that a person's "conscience" has with their lower cognition.<br/><br/>Thinking of a game specifically focused on this identity thing, I would personally go very overt, very gamey with it - have players play each other's super-egos or subconsciousness or whatever, why not. Have a willpower pool used to override old habits. Mechanize that thing, that's where the fun's at. Break it really down, have the entire crew together playing a single character's brain patterns, really get in there and question the identity illusion. You'll get to advocate for the learned childhood habits in the basal ganglia, I'll take care of the drug-addled dependency patterns and such!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444007/#Comment_444007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-12T21:51:02+00:00" title="March 12, 2015  9:51PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Of course, here we come to the fact that I don't really think that there is much in the way of a "body memory" in the way you posit - not unless we're talking about some sort of hypothetical partial brain transplants, but at that point we might as well be talking about arbitrarily combining two people into one. Your examples of e.g. cigarette habits, sexuality and such are all near entirely within the brain physiologically speaking; there is no "fine-motoric activity center" residing in a person's elbow that keeps reaching for the cigarettes, that's all in the hindbrain.<br/><br/>Which was your third question, basically: given that we're accepting my understanding of the mind-body divide that I explained at the start (and that's what I'm working from here, as you asked about our thoughts and all), I don't think that a brain transplanted to a foreign body would experience much of a "body memory" - they would have some trouble adapting, perhaps even crucial difficulties (like, not being able to walk without falling down difficulty), but those would all be due to the way their motor control and other body control neurology would be maladjusted in comparison to the needs of the new body.<br/><br/>OK, so I guess that's not the most constructive answer I could be giving here. Thinking further - if I think that basically everything interesting is in the brain, then who is saying that we would be transplanting an entire brain? <i>You</i> are speculating about mere mind transfer, it's me who brought this brain thing in here. Why did I do it, and couldn't we think of the mind transfer in some other, less grossly physical manner?<br/><br/>My answer is that I genuinely don't think so - the mind is the brain, pretty much, and I don't understand even in the highly conceptual and hypothetical way of science fiction what "mind downloading" to a pre-existing brain's wetware would look like. Like, what are we doing to that brain to impress a new mind on it? Burning off all the synapses and then force-growing new ones to accord with a preregistered pattern, effectively cloning a different brain? Maybe we are doing this only to some brain parts, leaving e.g. the basal ganglia and such disinteresting bits (being ironic here) alone? Or are we even talking of a brain anymore, maybe that body just has a computer in the skull and we're simulating a mind inside the computer?<br/><br/>In case I'm not being clear, the difficulty I see in saying that we burn off the bits of the brain that "are the mind" and then grow new parts to replace them is that it is far from settled as to which parts that would entail - which parts are the mind, if we are assuming that there are parts in the brain that <b>are not</b>? In fact, we may to a degree say that it's arbitrary - you get to choose, being the progenitor of this technology, and the mind behind its purpose!<br/><br/><b>*</b> Do you want the new hybrid brain to be able to walk right off - then don't burn out the old motor control, but you'll also likely end up keeping the old muscle memory!<br/><b>*</b> Do you want the hybrid brain to be able to use its perception apparatus - then don't burn out those bits, but prepare to maybe have some pattern recognition spill over!<br/><b>*</b> Do you want the hybrid brain to be able to remember things from the past of the body - perhaps you'll leave a part of the hippocampus untouched, creating a true hybrid memory!<br/><br/>I think that there is a practically infinite number of ways to cut this knot, we could mean <i>anything</i> when we say that we're "downloading a mind", if we're not talking about a whole-brain transplant. This could mean that you need to either leave all the details up in the air to be found out in play (I would certainly appreciate it if we didn't know in advance whether the PC is actually this person or that), or you need to do some specific drawing of lines about what parts of a brain you'd be switching over - and how that would affect the whole.<br/><br/>I hope that I'm not being unhelpful with this deconstruction - my point is not to say that your premise is flawed, it is more to draw attention to the fact that you can pretty much answer your own questions in whatever way you want and still be entirely correct - it all depends on what exactly is meant by the "mind download". It could even be something as simple as just swapping over the memories and skills (and perhaps habits), leaving everything else alone - you'd get an individual who thinks that they are the new person and has all their skills, while having most of the old brain stay intact. To me this would not be a "mind transfer" so much as a "mind hybridization", but I could understand somebody calling it transfer.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444014/#Comment_444014" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T02:26:39+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  2:26AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Euro, yeah those are good points I think for some players there may be too much of a disconnect to accept the central conceit that makes the setting tick at all, so it's probably worth coming up with something at least somewhat logical. I agree with you on the body memory thing, those examples were actually lifted right out of <i>Altered Carbon</i>, where a person (and all that that entails) are digitized and are downloaded in little things called stacks that reside at the top of the spine. Stacks as a kind of backup so you don't really die if your stack is preserved. While it doesn't make all that much sense when I think about it, I did find it fun and flavorful.<br/><br/>I confess I didn't put as much thought into the ability to digitize consciousness as to the ramifications of doing so and how best to explore that in the setting, but what I was envisioning was the brain still being there, as people are still born and develop in a natural way and need their brain. However, when they do get their stack put in, at that point the stack acts as a replacement for the brain basically, and filters everything through it, bypassing the brain completely. Maybe even the brain is removed to make way for the stack and looks like a cyberbrain, or maybe it's nestled in the spinal cord like in the Takeshi Kovacs novels and is called a stack. Regardless, all messages coming from the body flow through it, and all messages being sent from the brain back to the body also flow through it and the brain is thoroughly circumvented. At least, that's what I was envisioning.<br/><br/>What's more interesting to me is exploring the consequences of separating mind and body and what kind of stress a mind would encounter in a new body. Would there need to be conditioning software built into the cyberbrain, or some false memories or manipulation of memories to keep the mind from going into too much distress? Would everyone with a stack have their own therapist only they can see to talk them and help them adjust to a new body, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444015/#Comment_444015" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T03:02:55+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  3:02AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, right. I've read this story - Greg Egan, wasn't it? About a computer system trained over a long period of time to perfectly emulate the human brain's output, on the principle that once the computer is capable of producing entirely identical outputs for months and months at a time, they may as well be considered a copy of the person, enabling us to dump the wetware and let the computer take over entirely. A neat solution to the difficulties of brain digitization, as instead of having to scan the brain it suffices to produce a neural net black box that passes as identical in output. Rather creepy when the system dysfunctions, of course <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>But anyway, what I would expect, realism-wise, from a fully-replaced brain (computerized replacement or "simply" a brain transplant) would be months-long recuperation as the brain adapts to the necessarily pretty unique inputs and outputs of the new body; the sense and motor control software of the brain has evolved side by side with the neural system of the original body after all, so I'd expect e.g. the vision of the new body to seem like colorful blots to the new brain/computer for a while, until the brain adapts to the new sensory arrangement. (This expectation on my part is borne out of some research they've been doing on sensory replacement out in the science world - interesting stuff.)<br/><br/>So learning to see, hear, walk, talk with the new body, to begin with. (And probably a semi-permanent automation of some of the autonomic nervous system functions - you don't want to wait until the computer-brain learns how to make the heart go bumb.) Later on the computer brain stack would, I expect, adapt ever more perfectly insofar as the low-level functions go; as I speculated earlier, my understanding is that the neural controls of the body itself are "dumb" in information science terms, so with the remarkable plasticity of the brain I simply wouldn't expect any dramatic struggling - nothing like shadow personalities or such (unless the brain is still alive up there and partially in contact with the rest of the body, of course).<br/><br/>I would truly expect most of the long-term stress from the process to be psychological, assuming that the computer/body interface is essentially as good as that of the natural brain. It'd still be rather scary for a person not thoroughly climatized in advance, and cognition is interestingly independent of biology in some ways - even with a healthy body, the brain stack could twist itself into knots over things like wanting really, really hard to be different than it is. The cognizant level of the brain stack would also be confused by the different physical signals I discussed earlier - it would remember what green looked like in its old body, what running felt like, and so on; this could potentially become a fixation of some sort for some types of minds, while others would naturally adapt instead of clinging to memories.<br/><br/>So yes to psychiatry and funky training exercises (could be anything from meditation to wearing tinted eyeglasses, I guess), no to body memory and such ghosts in the machine.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that a civilization capable of this sort of thing could surely also fake body neurology virtually. This would be useful in that you could hook up the brain stack to a virtual simulation of their new body months in advance and teach the brain to adapt to the new body in advance. Saves time in the recuperation phase, and possibly gives advance warning of psychological issues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444016/#Comment_444016" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T03:47:47+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  3:47AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Euro, this is good stuff. Yeah, I was thinking of mainly exploring self-identity through the uncanny and perception of the world and one's own body, which is a pretty big stable of good cyberpunk in my mind.<br/><br/>I think we're pretty much on the same page about most of the stress being psychological, and I really like what you're talking about with dissonance between the stack and the new body. In the Takeshi Kovacs novels, virtual simulation is a pretty big thing as well and time can be controlled within it as well, so it's used for things like torture and other scary stuff as well. <br/><br/>I also like the idea of a shared consciousness between players, but what I was originally thinking was dealing with the identity issues in a more traditional cyberpunk fashion, in which there are adventures and such, but it'll be the GM's job to ground said adventures in at least one question that is meant to be posed or implied to the players, kind of like Ghost in the Shell wraps a thriller around questions like how could a cyborg whose only organic components is what's left in her cyberbrain, or an ASI, reproduce.<br/><br/>Here's some setting background to show you want I've got so far:<br/><br/>That said, what I've been writing so far is a world in which people people began to live partially through the internet, but a kind of plague wiped the internet out and trapped everyone's mind's inside of it (in a Matrix-like fashion) soon after an ASI is birthed via a mix of modeling the human brain and an advanced AGI; it learns rapidly. The bodies of those connected at the time the AI storms rage across the internet drop dead and humanity begins again, lead by the ASI that helped closes off the internet to humanity to protect them. It gathers what remains of humanity at points of light around the world and we start again new. Flash forward a ways in the future and the ASI has long since left Earth, having outgrown humanity, and thoroughly explored the Earth. Though gone and the ASI has colonized parts of the moon and seemingly moved on to other reaches of the universe as well, before it left it left kind of lobotomized fragments of it self to keep watch over mankind and the internet should the unthinkable happen again, and to kind of police mankind in a way as well, should they accidentally discover AI again and it is not as "human" as it. <br/><br/>The setting is Seoul in the far future, maybe 2099 or so, and cities are comprised of districts, each with a mega company/government that has control of it and a CEO that is also the preacher and president for that district. Mega corps were started by various religious leaders, who got rich off of preaching to stadiums of people in Nigerian preacher-like fashion. Each district is unique, to some degree or another, in religious and other beliefs, and there are overarching rights and laws that apply to all districts, with the advanced AGIs left behind having ultimate authority over everything. There are algorithms in place to ensure the continued survival of mankind, and all media and culture is filtered through said algorithms. People still produce content and work (depending on district, but everyone is essentially freelance and they get work based on skills and how well they work, etc. in certain districts, etc.) but only produce stuff handed down from the algorithm, so art and culture is only every really produced by AI.<br/><br/>Because of this, culture and art produced pre-collapse is both illegal and in high demand, especially by the elite. There's a black market for it, and that's where the PCs come in - they play culture divers. The PCs are minds that have been salvaged from the internet (which still exists and can be connected to via all the fiber optics and such that was created pre-collapse, but it's so dangerous, and connectivity feared so greatly, that only crazy, or desperate people, ever jack in). The minds are given bodies and are totally foreign to this new world, but are valued for their knowledge of old culture and for being able to navigate the internet intuitively, since they grew up in a society where almost everyone was always jacked in to some degree or another. <br/><br/>So, essentially, PCs are new minds, so they don't have to know anything about the world, but are experts on old culture (like we as players are). They produce, or more commonly, extract "authentic" culture from the internet for their patrons, can choose to sell it, or release it some form to try and help or form a resistance to society as it exists. <br/><br/>Obviously, I'm glossing over a lot of setting detail here, but essentially the goal is to make them feel like strangers in a strange land, and kind of match it up to some my experiences as a foreigner in another culture - mostly living here in Korea, while also exploring all kinds of far bigger questions as a result of the setting and tech. I like the idea of an AI society that is more "human" that mankind now, that explores and feels wonder, but can't exist in a human body for various reasons. The adventures PCs have will be both in the real world (the black market around culture, the resistance, selling culture to make money vs. trying to use to awaken mankind, dealing with a new body and one that is not owned by you, that has a previous history and most likely family attached to it, etc.), and delving back into the wasteland that is the internet, navigating its dangers to download culture, or memories, or whatever to produce a product or narrative of value to a society with a sense of fauxstalgia and black market around old culture. Something like Ghost in the Shell, meets Indian Jones, meets Jumanji.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444017/#Comment_444017" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T05:15:20+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  5:15AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eclipse Phase has a lot of stuff similar to what you're looking for, I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Honestly, to me it doesn't matter at all what sort of speculative society you construct as long as you're nailing down who's getting stepped on really clearly.

I'm going to try to do something to get it!" and then the GM says, "But wait!  There's this thing about your character that interferes with that!"

Hope this helps!</blockquote>\nYeah, a lot of this ideas are where I was going with it, but it made me start to wonder just how much of this stuff is body-based. For example, neurological conditions like synaesthesia and tourettes I think might be hard to be GM-facing, since those are pre-existing conditions that the players would be seemingly already aware of and have dealt with most of their lives, so it wouldn't be anything "new" so I'm not sure if it's something the GM should be describing it for the player. Hmm...<br/><br/>Body stuff like sluggishness or not needing a lot of sleep, injuries and wear and tear would be pretty standard fare and all GM-facing I'm thinking, it's just with the neurological stuff mostly that I'm very unsure. I mean, I like the idea of encouraging the play of characters with disabilities or disorders, but I do worry about representing them properly and whether there's any basis for it to be GM-facing. Unless the body stuff is determined by GM, and the neurological stuff is determined by the player, and the GM just does the best they can to represent the world to the player as per their choices they've made.<br/><br/>Maybe when you hook a mind up to a new body the stress that it can cause can form certain disorders to begin with and/or certain stresses or experiences could trigger their development as well and that can be a kind of mechanic within the game? I can see that being a bit of a nightmare to set up though, since I wouldn't want it to look like any sanity system I've ever seen in any game before - sanity points or spirals or random tables and such. There'd have to be specific triggers linked with stress or the uncanny that lead to disorders or problems that actually made sense, and ways to overcome them, if applicable, and that feels a bit daunting.<br/><br/>I wonder how much of a cop out it'd be to set the GM with something like principles so that they could take advantage of chances to trigger dissonance and the uncanny within the setting, and let the players choose how they react to it as they like? I mean, no matter what some games say, you're always trying to elicit reactions from the players anyway, not their characters, so if you give the GM the tools and the mandate to try to elicit those reactions (and the players have the buy-in and know what the game is going to be about, to some degree), is there any need of a mechanic within the game for that kind of stuff?<br/><br/>There's definitely going to be a lot of social elements that I'll be building in to add another dimension to the dissonance within the setting, and also mechanics for a certain degree of on-the-fly world building and tech as needed as well, but I feel a lot more comfortable coming up with that stuff.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444041/#Comment_444041" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-13T17:44:18+00:00" title="March 13, 2015  5:44PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see it as problematic to place neurological conditions (disorders or otherwise -- some stuff could look like superpowers!) under the GM's purview.

I wasn't going for "this body is used to this, so now you are too", I was just thinking that if I were to have, say, synaesthesia, and my consciousness/ego were moved into a new body, I would still have that condition, because it is neurological and is a part of my identity already. On the other hand, if I'm 18 years old, and ego is moved into the body of senior citizen, there are going to be all kinds of new things going on that don't match up to my already existing perception of the world and my body.<br/><br/>I guess what I was trying to say is this: if all things neurological carry over with your consciousness, then pre-existing conditions and such would carry over as well, but would have already been part of the world view of the character (there's nothing new there). Should not the GM concentrate on relaying the dissonance with the new setting and body to the player?<br/><br/>I think what you're envisioning is someone's consciousness being downloaded into both a body and a brain with pre-existing conditions, and so the new consciousness would not have experienced this brain's particular neurological make-up in addition to the body side of stuff? Which is a cool idea and would allow for a lot more exploration, but I'm not sure I could reconcile the technological implications. If we have the technology to erase a brain and put a new one in, why would we bother keeping parts of the brain while erasing others? Or put another way - wouldn't we <i>have</i> to completely erase the existing neurological make-up of a brain in order to put another into it?<br/><br/>I was envisioning a piece of technology that, when installed, basically took over and circumvented the brain. With that kind of tech, I can only really imagine either pre-existing conditions coming over, or developing them as part of the stress of being put into a new body and realizing how much your body is part of your identity. <br/><br/>Are you thinking of something else? Like reanimating dead brains and transferring a new consciousness into it or something, perhaps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444052/#Comment_444052" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-14T02:59:21+00:00" title="March 14, 2015  2:59AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, if consciousness transference occurs via physical brain creation/transformation, then I agree, you're right, you won't be inheriting a body's tourettes or synaesthesia.<br/><br/>I was imagining something different, I guess something more magical or less scientifically obvious.

I think that, because the idea of waking up in a body which you have to explore sounds non-optimal, I got the idea that this would be occurring accidentally, or out of desperation, or out of necessity toward some end.

I think a mind in a new body would experience considerable distress fairly often (at least for the first while), so there'd probably need to be some kind of a regulating system like discussed above, with conditioning or therapeutic software built-in or available in some fashion, and even those that weren't in a new body having nightmares about being swapped or losing control of their body, having to give it up, etc.<br/><br/>In the setting the districts are controlled by mega corps rooted in religion, with their leaders being the mega preachers of their district. Because all of their money stems from religion, they hold enormous sway and the also produce all kinds of goods and products marketed in their district as well, but the heavy religious elements means that those with cyberbrains or stacks are viewed as criminals. There are not a lot of people on the planet anymore, so bodies are in short supply. Criminals are punished by having their consciousness removed and stored for X amount of time depending on the crime. During that time, someone else is uploaded in and can use the body as they see fit, though there are all kinds of law to protect from organic damage and such. So actually using and having this technology is not looked on very favorably, and is not acceptable in a lot of religions (or at least looked down on), yet some people are going to want to live forever, or longer. Because bodies and the process are rare and expensive as well, the fact that the PCs wake up in a new one suggests all kinds of immediate stuff that has to be dealt with across the board - adjusting to a new body, adjusting to the new society, adjusting to someone else probably owning you, or being in debt to be able to get a body, etc.<br/><br/>To answer your question though, David, I don't think it doesn't matter to me all that much in terms of new brain/old brain (I actually like the implications of working with existing pre-existing conditions in both the mind and body and reconciling that with your identity as you know it), but I do feel the need for it to make sense in more of the cyberpunk, extrapolate and enhance the tech and problems of the present to the future kind of way. <br/><br/>The fact that the tech exists also implies the ability to mess with it too though, just like AccountingForTaste suggests, that's for sure!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
