The basic idea is that Gods need belief, and America is a rough place for them because Americans put all their belief into Things and Ideas. Odin, Czernobog, Anansi, and the like were transplanted here by settlers who have long since died, and the world is slowly forgetting them. Where they once were mighty beings of Fear and Love, they have been replaced by the new divinities of Media, Internet, and Government.<br/><br/>Along come the players.<br/><br/>The PCs will be drawn into the ongoing Culture war between the Old and the New. Their first assignment will be to protect Paris Hilton, who has found herself yet again to be a media (little m) darling. The backlash from major news networks covering someone who is only famous because she's famous is having a negative effect on Media (big M). The Old Gods want this to continue as long as possible, while Media wants Hilton removed from the picture, both literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>The predicament I'm in is trying to find different ways to neutralize someone without killing them. Killing her is an option, but the media frenzy that would result, as well as anniversary specials in later years makes it a last option. Kidnapping would be even worse, as the media frenzy would continue as long as she was held and for a while after. She might even manage to parlay it into a movie deal and play herself (unthinkable!).<br/><br/>So, how does one take someone out of the media's eye without drastic measures that would increase the focus instead? The PCs' jobs would be to stop these things from happening, so preferably they'll all involve being near Paris, or discovering clues near her and following them.<br/><br/>A couple of scenes I want to slip in, that don't necessarily have to tie into any schemes by Media are:\n<ul>\n<li>A Hollywood party. This will give the PCs a chance to rub elbows with Dionyssus<br/></li><li>Paris takes her bodygaurd to the Library. She's heard that there are starving children in Africa who can't read, so she's donating a few crates full of old Style and People magazines<br/></li><li>If there is a female PC, Paris may find herself in legal troubles and need someone to protect her inside<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94748/#Comment_94748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T12:37:12+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One word: methamphetamine.

Because almost everything that would happen to her, good or bad, would increase rather than decrease attention.<br/><br/>I think that once someone has reached Paris levels of fame, the only way to kill it is to transform it. This is a long process, not something the PCs could flip a switch and do, so I'm not sure you'd want to take this approach as a first session in a campaign.<br/><br/>Look at Britney Spears. She has gone from up-and-coming star, to pop superstar, to glamour girl, to has-been, to media whore, to laughing stock in the span of a few years. She has probably never been more famous than she is right now. Yet I don't get the impression that people <i>care</i> about her - more that they like to <i>laugh</i> at her. I suspect this is the last step before you are put away back into obscurity - like the life cycle of a star, it has to go supernova before it finally dies.<br/><br/>For Paris, I like the meth idea - it wouldn't be a longshot. Have her show up in some horrible places. Have some bad stuff happen to her, all as a result of her own choices (or seemingly so). Have a rehab clinic reject her after trying to sign in for the fifth time in two months. Increase media coverage until the point where it's unbearable - and then have them move on to the Next Big Thing. No more Paris.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94774/#Comment_94774" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:13:30+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Ben hit on it... once crowned by the media, the only way to become a non-media-darling is to slip into mediocrity.

Stagnation and stillness is what kills it.<br/><br/>So, Media would basically be trying to get her to grow up.  Settle down, maybe get into business or marry well, and have kids, or something else that's completely mundane for someone well off.<br/><br/>The players would basically keep trying to provoke her into outrageous circumstances (or frame her if Media is doing a really good job).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94834/#Comment_94834" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T15:27:20+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  3:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the input everyone!

The cosmology of American Gods isn't one where the old gods can wait around, because they're wasting away from a lack of respect and tradition. It's like there's a finite bucket of mojo out there, and if you want more you have to take it from someone else. If you run out, you fade away into obscurity and eventually go to the barren caverns of the Under-Underworld where dead Gods lie, little more than a museum piece in the ultimate halls of failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95850/#Comment_95850" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T07:30:23+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  7:30AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2007 7:33AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They could get her do more porn and move to Las Vegas.
