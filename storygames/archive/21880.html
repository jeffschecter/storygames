                    This is a split from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21862/" rel="nofollow">the long thread about spicy play</a>. I separated it because that thread's run pretty long and I can't be bothered to read through it in its entirety at this late date. I'm sure somebody will tell me if I missed something important.

For what it's worth, I chose "princess play" originally in reference to the kind of children's play that has particular similarity to it: while performative/competitive children's games like "cops and robbers" are often compared to rpgs, role-immersive play is also popular with children. Boys often like to pretend to be superheroes and such, but this type of play is perhaps associated more with girl-children, who might indeed play at being a princess (or a mother, or a superhero, or something else).<br/><br/>I have never intended the description as a negative one, and I'm not quite sure why it's so often taken that way. My best theory - cynical as it is - is that gamers are so steeped in cultural misogyny that they automatically take it as an insult if something they do is compared with something girls do. It's like I'm calling you an unmanly man by describing your playstyle as "princess play". What I personally think about princesses and gender roles doesn't even enter into it.<br/><br/>I'd be fine with "role-inhabiting play" as a term myself, but... don't we want to have catchy, fun jargon that's easy to remember? For me just starting to call this sort of play "princess play" was a minor breakthrough, as comparing the psychology of what was <i>actually</i> going on at the table to a small child playing dress-up actually helped me understand and observe the creative psychology on a thoroughly different level.<br/><br/>(The fact that "princess play" goes thematically together with the somewhat related concept of "dollhouse play" works well for me, too. In comparison, calling it "superhero play" wouldn't work at all - people would just assume that I'm talking about superhero rpgs instead of a specific creative agenda, albeit one common to superhero rpgs.)

I think that practices similar to the "spicy roll" have been used a lot in a princess play context, and successfully too. They evidently go together well.<br/><br/>They're not the same thing, however, assuming I understand the "spicy agenda" correctly. The way I understand it is that it's a new name for participationist GM-story railroad. The name comes from using task resolution dice rolls as a dialogue technique; rolls are interpreted in a vague fashion where they essentially become an improvisation aid for the GM, and occasional justification for player pushback - spice on otherwise diceless fiat resolution.<br/><br/>Given this understanding, it's a classical comparison between a technical framework (what has occasionally been called "technical agenda") for structuring a game, and an actual creative goal of play. The "spicy play" is a method of defining player roles and activities during play, while "princess play" is what you're attempting to achieve. The former seems to me rather well suited to achieving the latter.<br/><br/>Some specific features of spicy play that have the potential to work for princessing:<br/><b>*</b> All sorts of descriptive rules for defining characters exist, which helps you establish an interesting character identity. These descriptive rules are clearly under-utilized by the resolution system, which is a good thing, as you aren't forced to optimize the character towards some specific task unless you want to.<br/><b>*</b> The GM does not have an intrinsic motivation to challenge and break the player characters; he doesn't even need to care about them very much in his GM role as long as they don't stray from their assigned story roles. Plenty of space for the players to strut their elf-stuff.<br/><b>*</b> The task distribution between the GM and character players frees the character players from having to care about things like "what happens next": they're free to focus on princessing, which is ultimately an aesthetic, non-strategic activity that requires a background context (which the GM provides) but doesn't necessarily feed back into it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are totally Spicy games that are not very princessing-friendly. <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is my go-to example of a Sim game - also a very Spicy-friendly game - that is very much not an ideal platform for princessing. The game presumes that the player characters are much less interesting than their setting, requires them to be rather ordinary, doesn't even let them be conspicuously good at what they do... it is in many ways the opposite of a typical princessing game like say anything from Whitewolf ever.

I agree on all points. SwM might also be the only spicy roll game text that I've actually read, unless we count <i>Dread</i> as one. (I wouldn't myself - Dread explicates the related idea of "progress-tracking dice" rather than "spicy dice".)<br/><br/>Do note that the easiest way to avoid 2B is that the GM actually understands the player desire to princess all over the place. I've found that GMing Simmy stuff like say superhero games or high fantasy hero games has become massively easier for me once I figured out this princessing stuff. It truly is often the case that what makes the player really happy is simply <i>the opportunity to play their character in a situation you provide</i>. As long as your chosen systemic paradigm can deliver that, and encourage the forming of strong princess identities, and not break characters, you just might find out that your game is already doing everything some people want to do.                </div>

                            I call the player who seeks princess play the Actor (damn phallocratic suffix). For them, it's mainly about expressing a persona. <br/><br/>"These descriptive rules are clearly under-utilized by the resolution system, which is a good thing, as you aren't forced to optimize the character towards some specific task"<br/>I think I disagree, if I understand correctly. The Actor should be able to use their game resources fully to express their character. It is sub optimal only if their table don't know their desired play style. If the Actor plays in a confined area of mechanical inefficiency, this is a very bad clinical sign.                        </div>

                            Is expression really necessary though? I find that a lot of my princess play satisfaction is internal, rather than performative. It's the same kind of mindset that has a person spend an hour tweaking the physical appearance of their character in a video game character generator despite the fact that their physical appearance has no mechanical effect on the game.<br/><br/>I can be whatever I want and it has zero direct impact on play, and that disconnect is actually a desirable thing. It's heavily actualizing in that identification with a character doesn't impede your ability to participate. Forcing someone into a niche necessitated by the game actually works counter to the Princess Agenda.<br/><br/>That was, I think, a major issue in a lot of people's criticism of perceived imbalance in 3E D&amp;D, for example, that character option choices they <i>wanted</i> to be expressive too often resulted in mechanically sub-optimal characters, particularly compared to players who weren't interested in Princessing.                        </div>

                            DeReel: princess play is not the same thing as being an actor. Princess players generally see strong inborn meaning in the character roles they inhabit (I would say "immerse in", but that's another terminological kettle). I agree with Yuka about much of the payoff being internal. There are social rewards to princessing as well, but you are your own first audience when doing this stuff.<br/><br/>For example, one of the players in our gaming group has a clearly observable interest towards playing macho, honorable warrior type characters. He usually picks characters like dwarves, paladins, noble savages or similar in various games. His favourite character play moments, the "princessing opportunities", revolve around tough male bonding (boisterous laughing, drinking, wrestling with bears), justice (avenging wrongs, giving bold speeches before battle) and similar themes; he generally likes situations where it's pretty obvious how a brave warrior type would tackle them. We tease him regularly about how he tends to play to a type, even in games where princessing is not particularly well-supported. He plays a "tough Irish cop" in <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> [grin].<br/><br/>From my observations this player rather enjoys princess play, but it's not because he likes to Act in character - it's this specific type of character that appeals to him, not the process of acting by itself. I realize now as I'm writing this that this guy happens to <i>incidentally</i> also have a theater hobby, so he does in fact apparently like acting as an artform, but believe me - I can distinguish when a player is playing to his type and when they're simply taking a character and running with it.<br/><br/>These "typecast" princess players aren't nearly the entire population of gamers amenable to princess play - I think that it's a pretty common creative agenda that most of us can enjoy. However, they illustrate the psychology well: to be truly entertained by princessing you actually need to find the role-inhabiting process somehow personally meaningful. The character concepts you find meaningful in this way will change over the lifetime of most people, and some people always have a wide interest in various kinds of roles, but it's always important to be true to whatever it is that you find relevant yourself.<br/><br/>I myself used to have an inclination towards magical and elfy character concepts when I was starting with roleplaying (I was a "pretends to be an elf" kid, I guess), but then I became a GM for so long that I'm only slowly coming back to grips with what I actually like to play. I think that I would need more and more consistent opportunities to be a character player in Simmy games that support princessing to really get to the bottom of this personally.                        </div>

This is directly the source of my negative reactions. I'm a woman who loves princesses, but I'm so used to seeing men on the internet use princess negatively because of how steeped in misogyny society is.
<blockquote>OK. Imagine you are handed a pre generated character. It is optimal. You act it. You express it. Is this not Princess play ?<br/></blockquote>
I would personally say that one can do Princess Play with characters that aren't their own OCs, as long as they get deeply attached to the characters, make them their own, and love them. <br/>A big part of princess play (as I understand it) has to do with loving your characters deeply, and wanting nothing more than to express who they are and tell their story. 
<blockquote><br/>The task distribution between the GM and character players frees the character players from having to care about things like "what happens next": they're free to focus on princessing, which is ultimately an aesthetic, non-strategic activity that requires a background context (which the GM provides) but doesn't necessarily feed back into it.</blockquote>
I feel like this one gets a bit complicated if you're the type whose princess has a deeply embedded story. Like, it's kind of a variable in my eyes depending on how much you look at characters and story arc as the same thing. <br/>Like, I would definitely call my playstyle a version of princess play, but we don't have a GM, and place a lot of importance on crafting what happens next, because with our play being nothing but the character arcs, telling the story beautifully is an intrinsic part of expressing out characters. <br/>Basically, I make no real distinction between controlling the story and controlling the character, since for me, characters and their story arcs are inextricably linked, are different facets of the same thing, if that makes sense.                        </div>

                            I'm presuming that Princess Play, like many sorts of sim play, requires psychological buy-in from the players. So like, if you like the pre-gen you're handed, maybe there's no problem there. But if you don't, then you won't "act it" and "express it" the way you would a character you actually want to play. I'm not sure to what extent Princess Play can encompass a "cold" portrayal.<br/><br/>If I get what you're saying DeReel, it's that you could fail to achieve satisfying Princess Play by, for example, trying to play someone charismatic who can't mechanically charisma their way out of a wet paper bag, and I think that's true: mechanics can reinforce or hinder your expression of your character. I'm not saying that character optimization and character expression can't coexist, just that decoupling them doesn't have to be an impediment, and can actually work to the benefit of either or both. Particularly if the primary draw of PP is passively psychological, then it's probably more beneficial to eliminate the possibility of failure hindering it than it is to rely on success bolstering it.<br/><br/>As an aside, in the Japanese roleplaying community there's an entire defined technique dedicated to this sort of disconnect, called "Makenai Roleplay" (something like "not giving in, not losing"): it's the practice of trying to use roleplay to spin bad mechanical outcomes into something that still maintains the ideal of your character.                        </div>

                            For me too, the Actor gets paid first by interior satisfaction. It's sad if they have no public. I think you can do the Acting in a bold way, risking failure to achieve (sucess in the mission ?) in Sim play. Or you can play it safe. Pianissimo interstitial acting.

Yeah. I like princesses, though. I'm going to play an outright Disney princess type character sometime when I get a chance in a Simmy long-term campaign. Ars Magica or something princess-friendly like that [grin].

That makes sense to me, certainly. In my experience there are a variety of different game structures that can do a good job for princess play purposes. For example, I think that a GM-plotted superhero game is often a very sensible vehicle for players who want to get their Wolverine on, so to speak. Meanwhile, we did a wuxia-themed princess play campaign with relationship mapping (and the implied weak plotting) last winter, and that worked, too, in this regard. (Most of the players had difficulty grasping the genre, admittedly, but that wasn't a structural fault.)<br/><br/>My comments on how the Spicy dice vision can support princess play were just one way to go about it. Princess play can be achieved quite well with game structures that aren't anything like Spicy dice GM shows. They're not just distinct concepts, but they're, ultimately, concepts about different things: one is about game structure, the other is about game goals. (Or that's what a dirty Forgite tries to tell you, anyway.)                        </div>

                            I find that I'm loathe to discard the term "princess play", given how perfect it is for describing this style of play, and how memorable it is. At this point it's ensconced in my personal vocabulary and unlikely to be replaced, at least in private use.<br/><br/>I agree that assumptions of misogyny (which is unfortunate, but understandable - there are many good reasons to assume that a gamer on the internet might be, indeed, trying to insinuate something) are what's holding us back from adopting the term without reservation.<br/><br/> </div>

                            I suppose so, even if I'm not that concerned about rpg theory evangelism. I don't mean to sound callous, because it's just gaming, but I don't necessarily feel that other people need to understand my armchair rpg theorizing [grin]. It's questionable whether theory has been that useful outside specific initiatory context anyway, historically; seems to me that the important thing is to find like-minded people who can benefit from shared exploration, rather than try to make theory generally accessible. You either get what the other guy is trying to say because it is useful in your own situation, or you don't, and terminology won't help there. Even the most neutrally phrased theory will just annoy people for whom it's not relevant.<br/><br/>Still, alternatives - "Identity-experiencing agenda" would be both precise and unlikely to ruffle feathers. I feel that it's not very transparent, so you get to explain what it means a lot, but at least it doesn't bring inappropriately frilly dresses to mind.<br/><br/>Maybe the best thing to do terminology-wise would probably be to create a grand exploratory framework that provides a lot of names for all sorts of creative agenda variations in bulk. That would have the necessary conceptual weight to justify abandoning prior word choices in favour of a consistent terminology.                        </div>

                            I think it's going to be REALLY hard to beat "princess play", frankly.<br/><br/>The best thing I can think of might be to take a really colourful character and make a label that way.<br/><br/>"Wolverine Play", for instance. Or perhaps "Gandalf Play", or "Wize Wizard Play". (The gendered connotations, now masculine instead of feminine, is still not ideal, though.)<br/><br/>What about riffing on the Vampire comparison?<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>"Masquerade Play"                        </div>

                            Yes, I can see "Wolverine play". That could be a name for passive-aggressive turtling as well, though [grin].<br/><br/>That last one is pretty interesting, but that's mainly because it invites me to question whether the enhancement people have with masques is similar to princess play. I can see that, myself. People have masks they find enticing to adopt, and the reasons are perhaps similar to why somebody would feel it interesting to pretend to be an elf.                        </div>

                            Ooh, "Masquerade Play" is great!  Or even "Masque Play" if one wishes to sever from the specifics of Vampire.<br/><br/>The beloved character idea is cool too.  Wolverine is good for reveling in badassery, but maybe a slightly more navel-gazing hero would be a better exemplar?

                            Wouldn't Princess Play pretty much be the basic form of roleplay almost everyone does spontaneously, at least in small amounts, at any sort of costume party/Halloween party/fancy dress party?<br/><br/>I mean, some gamers may hate the term, but non-gamers would probably grok the term with about two sentences or less or explanation. I'm not sure any of the boring, hard to remember, alternative terms suggested have much advantage over Princess Play in that area.<br/><br/>Also, Princess Play, as a term, makes me laugh.<br/><br/>Wolverine Play I find unacceptable. Everyone knows Nightcrawler was vastly cooler than that Canadian psycho runt. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> <br/><br/>And yeah, in practice, everything White Wolf, especially early WoD 1e, is way into Princess Play territory and is pretty awesome for that. I can't imagine WW having ever gotten nearly as successful without it hitting a whole bunch of PP priorities in practice.                        </div>

I was actually going to ask Eero if he might expound briefly on Doll Housing, but then I got distracted. I suspect that, by analogy, Princess Play : Character :: Doll Housing : Setting, but I also think that there's a little more to it than that, as the relational aspect you have to your character is more direct/less mediated than the one you have to setting. <br/><br/>Like, it's easier to passively enjoy simply being your character, while a setting needs to be at least minimally interacted with to get it to give you the right kind of SIM fuzzies.                        </div>

                            I myself think that princess play is a specific type of (or perhaps vessel for) simulationist creative agenda, yes. To be clear, this is an experiental conclusion and not structural speculation as such: princess play feels very much akin to some other types of play that I think are Simulationistic. They all blend together seamlessly in the right conditions, really, which I guess might just be my imagination because it's suspiciously precisely what GNS theory would predict [grin].<br/><br/>Others I know of... at least these come to mind (and yes, they also have weird names):<br/><br/><b>Dollhouse play</b> is when you enjoy building fictional stuff and parading it around. Point-buy games like GURPS get into this occasionally, and <i>Ars Magica</i> is basically just an extremely ambitious "let's all build a wizard castle together now" dollhousing project. This differs from princess play mainly in the way the relationship between the player and character is construed; dollhouse play is less absolute about the intimate relationship, it's less about "I need to be an elf" and more about "let's make a cool elf together" or "let me show you this cool elf I made".<br/><br/><b>Substantial exploration</b> is when the game has a basis in prior art and focuses on discussing that prior art from various fresh perspectives. <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, some MERP motivations, various <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Star Wars</i> games... My own <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> campaign runs on this + princess play + some plot stuff, pretty much.<br/><br/><b>GM story hour</b> is the railroad plot stuff: the game delivers a first-person perspective on a story that is hopefully narrated skillfully. Horror games in general often run on almost exclusively this stuff. <i>Dread</i>, <i>Dead of Night</i>, etc.<br/><br/><b>Mechanical monkeying</b> is a thing that comes up in the heaviest type of Sim games, such as the classic point-buys and Ars Magica and whatnot. I think that it's a rare type that is difficult to get right, as it requires the players to be successful in crafting the system itself as a chassis of poetry for the actual subject of the game; if there is no specific and particular beauty in the way you solve the point distribution issue in simulating the Noldor vs. the mortals or whatever, then you're just wasting time with mechanical overhead instead of engaging this type of Sim value-add. You need to make mechanical discovery, and many systems aren't even capable of offering that.<br/><br/>I'm sure that there are other varieties of Sim, of course - this is just a list of what I've experienced personally over the last decade with a sufficient impact for me to have noticed it as being structurally discrete. The smart monkey might notice the relationship the above list has to the Forgite "elements of Exploration" analysis, which I do not believe to be a coincidence.                        </div>

                            Heh, "GM story hour" has a great ring to it.  I might use that.

Not sure how literally you intend the "let's build a thing" as the primary reward of play over time.

Thing is, what you describe sounds like a very clear example of Sim to me [grin]. It would go under that "GM story hour" label in my list above, except for the (for me personally) completely incidental technical detail of having multiple players doing storytelling. I can totally believe that storytelling and princessing are essentially parts of the same whole for you instead of two elements that can be considered separately.<br/><br/>Discussing GNS categorization is clearly an Extremely Useful Thing We Should Now Start Doing.<br/><br/>A thought that might be useful or might not: for me one of the core differences in what a story even means to Sim vs. Nar is about the fluidity of protagonist identity. A game where the protagonist identity is <i>discovered</i> through play, and this is a big deal, is clearly Narrativism. A game where the protagonist identity is largely fixed, probably emblematic and clear, is similarly a very typical Sim pattern that hampers a narrativist agenda in many ways.<br/><br/>When I'm confused about whether something I'm doing is Sim or Nar (this is not very common, partially because it's not <i>that</i> important), that's what I look at: is this about discovering a new story with new truths, or is this about reviewing an old one? Is it important to express this idea I have, or is it important to engage in a dialogue where a new idea might emerge?                        </div>

I would call genre emulation a type of substantial exploration, yeah, in the way I usually see it happening. It's basically a review of prior art with all the tropes still intact, but without all the particulars. Doing <i>Lord of the Rings</i> without the lords or the rings, if you will, as opposed to just assigning somebody to play Frodo and starting from there.<br/><br/>The whole "substantial exploration" class of Sim might not be very useful to other people. For me it's useful precisely because it recognizes it when a Sim game has an underlying dependence on prior art and when it's dealing with other stuff like e.g. a given player's dwarf obsession. So from my perspective a "let's replay Chronicles of Prydain with all the same events and characters" game is very similar in its creative purposes to a "let's play a high fantasy game with all the tropes in the right places" game.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm also curious if the "what if?" experiment, running a simulation, falls into what you've already covered or is separate.</p></div></blockquote>
That is a nice question, I like it.<br/><br/>I would say that what iffing is also a type of substantial exploration alongside genre emulation - it relies on a bunch of prior art over which you run your re-evaluations. Our <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> game is actually a light exercise in "what if" as it barrels along - the point of distinction being, "what if a bunch of D&amp;D heroes existed in Prydain on the eve of the War of the Horned King?" (I characterize it as a light exercise because I'm not putting major effort into the simulation so much as just picking on interesting threads of possibility that the heroes knock loose and showcasing them.)<br/><br/>It might indeed help make the techniques involved in play more transparent if we sliced that "substantial exploration" slice of the Sim pie a bit more. We have "genre emulation" and "what if", which are both pleasantly clear things. There's also "enjoying a classic", which captures the idea that substantial exploration is often about celebrating a separate work of art that you just happen to like a lot.                        </div>

                            That makes sense.  I'm used to thinking of sim as physics simulation, world simulation, etc, but I suppose that story simulation would also totally apply.<br/>The way that I play is definitely not standard narr, since standard narr requires "play to find out".                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/stefoid">@stefoid</a> I'd rather say people are attracted to a type of character for whatever reason. Else, there is no reason not to see PP as a limitation only. There is always identification. I suspect the character is an Archetype (I see no counter example). The power fantasy is at the same time a way to ensure the space for identification is safe : if you try to break the dream, the princess will block you off socially, the superhero physically.<br/>I still think it's the Actor with a limitation (isolation).                        </div>

That's actually a part of my insight from the GM side of the equation - the realization that it actually <b>is</b> about the player and their character. I understand how this can be viewed as selfish, but emotional honesty is important for getting anywhere in the arts, so own up to it and figure out how to make it work.<br/><br/>The big question for structuring the game, as a designer or gamemaster, is about figuring out how to allow the various players the space they need to perform their wish-fulfillment self-therapy ideal-self crapshoot in an emotionally safe and fun way. In other words: how to let everybody get their princessing on (including the GM in a way, often enough) without stifling the fun.

I'd say that it's helpful for the player if you understand yourself and know what you like. It's difficult to stumble upon a character that's fun for you to play for its own sake by pure accident.<br/><br/>A strong princess play character is not built on abilities or premise so much as they have a theme: Wolverine is "the best at what I do" with all the macho teeth-grinding that implies, for instance. Many people play essentially on instinct, but it doesn't hurt if you understand why you like Wolverine - that you're intrigued by the warrior lifestyle of a self-satisfied badass with nothing left to prove.<br/><br/>(By the way, this "theme advice" is a staple of traditional rpg text ritual content - the shallow parts that we skip when we read them because they're all fucking same always. Trad games often pay a lot of respect to princess play, even if the concrete support is usually haphazard. I've never really understood why you <i>actually</i> would want to start your character creation by freeforming up a character idea, but this often useless or even harmful conceit is actually useful for a princess play orientation.)<br/><br/>Once you have that concept, there's probably all sorts of game mechanics involved in giving it concrete expression in the given game. The real challenge during play is about realizing the character in action, however: how does the wolverine-ness of the character actually get portrayed in the activities of the game? Here it would be ideal if the game actually wanted you to wolverine all over the place, otherwise it's just going to be disruptive as fuck.<br/><br/>Every princess play character concept essentially comes pre-matched with its own "core activities" or "emblematic situations". Ideally the game "supports princessing" by having some way of achieving those situations. If this is the case, then Wolverine gets his turn at some point: maybe it's a combat game of some sort, so if you wait enough, the GM gets around to it, and you get to spout the tagline and turn the room into red mist. (To perhaps wallow in the societal displeasure this causes afterwards, or whatever your specific Wolverine take is about.)<br/><br/>My theory is that princess play is performative: while cool-down periods are practically necessary, they must be book-ended by opportunities to actually perform the character archetype, or there's no point to playing the game. It would be wrong to say that it's the only fun part, but I believe that you will have more fun playing Wolverine if you get to do the things Wolverine does: you try to solve things with violence, and hopefully there's a Cyclops there to hold you back from doing it when inappropriate; you flip all spiritual all of a sudden as you reign in the raging beast inside you; you become a righteous avenger in response to the circumstances. The individual games have nuanced interfaces that the players use to actually perform their character roles, so doing these things may imply dice-rolling and giving thespian speeches and whatnot, but the real unifying theme is that you get to rub your character vision all around the play space - that's the creative reward.<br/><br/>The question of what good princessing looks like is an interesting one, as it depends on how a given game is structured - what it expects the players to do so that it flows well as a joint creative exercise. It may be the case that it's actually important to the game that your princessing entertains the other players in some way, for instance. Often rpgs face the challenge of having to entangle a sometimes very solipsistic player character concept in a meaningful way with other complex material prepared by some other player. For example, a superhero game may actively rely on both the player doing Wolverine in a vivacious way <i>and</i> him willingly entanging Wolverine with whatever it is that the GM has brought to the table.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint I'd say that good princess play is about flexibility and an ability to engage with the game outside of the narrow perspective of waiting to be let loose. I know that I enjoy playing a princessing game like D&amp;D 4th edition with people more if they have a rich, varied and flexible interface between their character concept and the external world. It's much more interesting to GM for a princess character who actually reacts to most situations in a colorful way instead of just sitting there like a zombie until their specific fetish gets trotted out. Wolverine is actually an example of a character who can be a drag in this regard if the player's Wolverine vision is that the only thing he ever does when not murdering somebody is drinking beer - that's something you got to plan around instead of expecting the player to support you, in many games.<br/><br/>It is worth remembering that princess play doesn't usually form the entire creative payload of a given game. You usually have other things to enjoy in there as well, such as plot, some clever mechanical monkeying, or whatever. The opportunities to throw out cool powers and spout one-liners are just part of the entertainment. Your princess play will be more enjoyable if you can enjoy those as well instead of sitting impatiently and waiting for your opportunity to be Wolverine the whole night.                        </div>

                            So for Good Princess Play, you need de-isolating mechanics, like Bonds between player characters, or a relationship map to make the lack of bonds obvious. This way the collection of Archetypes can work as a whole, the herosphere, or coordinate interaction via plot elements. <br/>Anyhow it can't be all in your head : you've got to prepare it before play or act it out, or plain say it, for the table to coordinate their action, or prepare for failure (real). eg If the other players don't take the cue that your Barbarian is gonna rage at the Princess ball, your isolation will wreck the plot. Note that if it's only the characters missing the cues, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shindig_(Firefly)#Synopsis" rel="nofollow">that's</a> funny .<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">@yukamichi</a> Also, thank you for the tip about "Makenai roleplay".

                            Yes. That Wolverine thing there is actually an old parable from the Forge. Wolverine is popular, sure, and many roleplayers like to play characters very much like him, but the real point of the thought-exercise is to ask: how does the group handle it when Wolverine-the-eternal-loner gets into a violent argument with Cyclops, the wise leader? Do we have the necessary tools for running scenes necessary for character expression like the one where Wolverine tries to attack something and Cyclops stops him, or the one where the two fight (but not really) over leadership? Is there a Cyclops at the table, and does he understand his role in helping Wolverine express himself? Doing this kind of stuff is impossible if you don't have a meta-level awareness and some kind of communication to coordinate the players. Playing in a purist "always in character" way actively hampers this kind of character expression, because the other players won't necessarily know when you're doing a bit where Wolverine is supposed to lose, and when you're doing one where he's supposed to win, to properly support his theme.<br/><br/>(I realize that all this doesn't necessarily make any sense at all if you're not familiar with the old late '70s through '80s X-Men comics where Wolverine comes from. Old farts having old fart parables, with camels and stuff.)                        </div>

                            I got used to call this <i>Power Fantasy</i>. I feel this term more appropiate because it can be applied to any gender, it doesn't assume your preferences nor imposes any tag that may appeal to one side of the gender discussion and offend the other. It can carry all the implications of this play style just okay and it's got a history, at least since Forge times. <br/><br/>I mean, Power Fantasy as I understood was applied to games where PCs get more agency over the fiction so their story and presence become central to the game. I'm probably missing something, but is there a particular difference between both terms, Princess Play and Power Fantasy and what they mean?                        </div>

                            I think <i>Power Fantasy</i> has easily as many negatives attached as <i>Princess Play</i>, especially since there's often an unspoken-yet-understood or assumed <i>Male</i> in front of <i>Power Fantasy</i>.<br/><br/><br/>I also feel Power Fantasy implies a certain amount of constant success in superficially challenging* situations in a way that Princess Play does not. Part of that may be that Princess Play does have characters experiencing (minor/temporary) (loss/failure), provided an ultimate win is achievable. Part of it may be that there isn't even that much even superficial mock challenge involved.<br/><br/><br/>Someone mentioned Tea Party play as a term. There might be a fair bit of Tea Party Play in Princess Play. Or at least Sexy Vampire Blood Rave Play. No real challenges involved. Your character goes to the Cool Undead Kids Hangout, Looking all Cool, and Does Cool Stuff, with Cool Music Playing, while bouncing off other characters doing the same thing. I'm pretty sure I have attended a couple dozen VtM LARP nights that pretty much amounted to exactly this.<br/><br/>* <i>superficially challenging</i> here means challenging in appearance only. A Dragon appears! It gets an ass-whupping immediately! No real challenge of even a weak sort was ever involved.                        </div>

                            Funny enough, I feel just the teeniest tiniest bit of discomfort with "power fantasy" - it doesn't sound like something healthy or desirable in its connotations. It has a history of negative subtext, if you will. The underlying psychology is the same thing, though, as far as I understand it.<br/><br/>Aside from that, my only complaint is that in my opinion the rpg culture is too obsessed with strength, so implying that all princess play is about power (rather than other issues) feels culturally counter-productive - I think that gaming as a culture needs more honest appreciation of the variety of human issues, not relentless hammering on the issue of strength-based agency alone. Of course the same argument can be applied to "princess play" as a term - several people have outright said that it's a distracting phrasing.                        </div>

                            FWIW, the first time I saw the phrase "Princess Play", I immediately thought of "<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu?from=Main.GaryStu" rel="nofollow">Gary Stu</a>/<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" rel="nofollow">Mary Sue</a>" connotations. <br/><br/>The examples of the player always picking someone like a "tough irish cop" certainly sort of smell like playing a Marty Stu character, but there wasn't enough description for me to make that assertion with much certainty. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>I don't mind the term Princess Play either way.<br/><br/>I do kind of have a hard time telling the difference between this concept and Protagonism.

Well, yes. Isn't the whole point of the Mary Sue critique to question the sense in pushing your own princess play entertainment on other people? It's rather non-trivial how to make this sort of thing meaningfully social, and the answer certainly doesn't seem to be "go write novel-length fanfiction about your wish-fulfillment OC".<br/><br/>Or, to say that another way: roleplaying as a culture is big on Mary Sue-ism. It might be a smart idea to figure it out and perhaps attempt a constructive understanding. Giving it a negative label and forcing it underground isn't going to make it go away.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" rel="nofollow">Dreamer</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I do kind of have a hard time telling the difference between this concept and Protagonism.

A Narrativistic protagonist is a character embroiled in a Premise. A well-developed princess play character is steeped in Theme. One is a question, the other an answer.<br/><br/><b>Frodo as a Narrativist character:</b> "I am a British everyman, let's see how far that gets you against Satan."<br/><br/><b>Frodo as a Simulationistic character:</b> "I'm a hobbit with all these character ticks you've come to know and love. I am particularly at home as a humble yet persevering hero. Let's maybe put me in a new situation and see how I cope."<br/><br/><b>Wolverine as a Narrativist character:</b> "I might be an actual wolverine mutated into human form, that's how savage I am. Can I become a superhero and learn to get along with my multicultural team?"<br/><br/><b>Wolverine as a Simulationistic character:</b> "I am the best at what I do, and what I do isn't nice. I adventure with ninjas when I'm not doing my top gig as the baddest-ass X-Man."<br/><br/>The above juxtaposition is supposed to demonstrate how the entire attitude towards what a character even is becomes different when your creative purposes are different. One viewpoint sees the character as a ticking time thematic time bomb that exists so you can "play to find out". The other sees the character as a finished work of art in itself, ready to be dropped into various situations and enjoyed.<br/><br/>The reason for why Narrativist games are generally bad at supporting princess play is that almost all narrativist games feature character-internal thematic conflict that becomes resolved by the character changing and growing as a person. This is antithetical to the idea of letting a player define who their character is; narrativist games are traditionally often rather polite and round-about here, but the fact is that you don't get to decide that Frodo would never fall into temptation: the process of play will find that out, and maybe he will after all.                        </div>

                            Hehe, sorry for beating a dead horse, but reading about the player referenced above, I'm thinking of things like "method acting", or even being the type of actor who has roles specifically tailored to who they are. These seem like imperfect analogies, though. <br/><br/>Still, am I getting closer to understanding the concept if I said it was about becoming (edit; and i mean actually becoming) that kind of character in play and that bringing a deep sense of satisfaction as part of some wish fulfillment?<br/> </div>

                            Ah, then it's a matter of the cultural local* charge behind each term. I mean, I'm peruvian and the literal translation of <i>Power Fantasy</i> would be <i>Fantasia de Poder</i>. The expression here doesn't have any gender assumed connotations, like, at all. Even more - in the light of most modern viewpoints of the gender discussion,the word <i> Power</i> isn't never read or understood here as a male-only attribute. But that's just because of an accidental result of the use of language here, and not because peruvian culture is less misogynistic than any other (I'd bet that sadly it's probably the opposite, but we are trying to learn to be better than that).<br/><br/><i>Princess Play</i> would get translated here more or less as <i>Jugar a las princesas</i>, which sadly does hold a cultural charge capable of wounding sensibilities in my country. It's probably just too soon for us to feel comfortable using the term. But that's it, SG is my home but not my country so I'll stop opposing the use of the term and maybe even try to use it despite being totally uncomfortable with it, as this place is for me a worldwide space of cultural exchange for the better (being honest here, no sarcasm intended).                        </div>

                            In addition to gender, there is also the issue that a number of terms suggested over time ( as with Princess Play) have age related negative connotations that might not translate well across languages.<br/> <br/>Specifically, "Play" often is an indicator of being associated with children, and usually pre-preteen children at that. Not always, but often enough that it can raise hackles, which is why I mentioned the "reclamation" aspect of using such terms.<br/><br/><br/>In American English usage, I find there's some significant differences in initial reaction depending on whether one uses the term Play or Game or Sport/Contest.                        </div>

Not my intention to put a negative spin on it, but unfortunately, those were the terms that first popped to mind with the phrase and the example. <br/><br/>That bolded part is an interesting question (maybe for another time?). I've generally disliked playing with people who wanted to have hyper competent, never lose, Gary Stu type characters because I tended to want characters who got put through the grinder and come back stronger. Maybe i'm still misunderstanding what Princess Play is (so I'll search the forum for other threads).                         </div>

Likewise, they are socially adept enough to allow themselves a temporary minor character failure occasionally, especially if it swings the spotlight around to another player's character and their defining Princessness.                        </div>

Haha. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I was specifically thinking of a friend who was an extreme example. If he was playing AD&amp;D in Krynn, he wanted to break all the rules and max all his stats and/or own legendary artifacts like the Dragonlance as a starting character. We also played a lot of freeform storytelling, and he never, ever, ever even wanted to have a bloodied nose. He just basically wanted to steamroll even the final baddies. <br/><br/>That's the most extreme case I've seen of whatever that type of play/agenda is called. Other players weren't as bad, but still kinda bent that way to varying degrees. <br/><br/>In contrast, I wanted to be competent but go through a lot of struggle. Sometimes to the point of being like Deckard in Bladerunner, who basically gets slapped around all the time, while still somehow being heroic. At the very least, suffer like John McClane in Diehard, even if badass.   <br/><br/><br/>Not sure now that it's even relevant to Princess Play, so enough of me hijacking this thread. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>

                            My experience is precisely that the idea of being at risk of losing is rather secondary to a player engaging in princess play. I would even describe the whole framework of competitive gaming as hostile to princess play, as it effectively deconstructs the entire idea with thinking like "can you really be said to be heroic if you know that you're going to win" and things like that. The princess player doesn't want to "really win" anyway, they're into it because they want to fantasize about stuff rather than engaging in a pale simulation of the thing itself.<br/><br/>A concrete observation: we're now 20 sessions in on a D&amp;D 4th edition campaign that has no "real risk" anywhere in it that I can see. All important outcomes occur not even by real-time fiat, but rather by being pre-designed. Princess play prospers as a possible entertainment venue because the players can be confident that the GM reflects their character vision back at them - supports and affirms it. Have your character adopt a heroic role, and we'll make it work. No need to prove the heroism by gambling, or win the right to it by passing a gauntlet; the only thing you need to do is to express your intent to adopt a role so the GM (and other players) can support the choice.<br/><br/>It should go without saying that trying to "get it all" by construing the game as simultaneously offering real risks and deeply meaningful story creation and an immersive experience and an empowering opportunity to engage a role - that's the recipe for a traditional kitchen sink game design that fears to commit to a clearly defined activity. If it was going to work, I suspect that it already would have. And if it actually has, as some argue, then go play the perfect game.                        </div>

                            Sure, and I don't even think that there's much of an issue there - just don't play status games about who's rpg play is the manliest because it's more like football or something. Different princess play character visions require different types of outside interaction, often different types of adversity, but it would be a grave mistake to rank one better than the other just because the player's gig is more misery tourism and less power fantasy.<br/><br/>Regarding players with boring never-fail Mary Sue teflon characters, I think that it is much more fruitful to analyze this as a stage of psychological and artistic development than as a defect that must be purged from the culture. I mean, sure, I don't really disagree that some people are pretty childish compared to some others when asked to express themselves, but generally speaking there are reasons for why that is the case, you know? One of the best ways to actually get a player to develop is to help them along rather than shutting them down.<br/><br/>That's why I like to take a pretty hands-off and non-judgemental attitude to princess play: the point is not for me to climb on the judge's chair as the GM and decide who's earnest superhero character is the most sophisticated and artistically justified and interesting. Rather, I think that a well-designed princess play game, such as Fate, should be bold about establishing the inalienable rights of each player to do their own freakish thing to a rather large degree. There should be freedom to play the character you want to play, even if another player thinks that it's childish.<br/><br/>Basically, my theory is that the way to get this guy to move on with his dwarves-axes-beer fixation in a humanly useful way is to let him play those dwarves and other dwarvy characters. Get the concept out there, produce successful self-expression. Condemning his eagerness because it's "Mary Sue behavior" and unworthy of fine art might help him fake sophistication, but does that make him more sophisticated, or just more repressed?<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that judging princess play on basis of how good the story-after is exhibits a category error in thinking. It is a marginal view of what something like D&amp;D is to think that the elf therapy sessions should somehow produce skilled fantasy literature. If that's what one wants, letting some people play out their elf issues with dice is maybe the wrong way to go about it.                        </div>

                            Eero, feel free to ignore this if you think I'm about to trigger a derail, but I think your Frodo/Wolvy Sim/Nar breakdown shows exactly how hair-thin that CA divide can be at the edges.  A cool character premise entering an interesting situation?  This swings very easily between one kind of "see what happens" and the other.  Without a very precisely worded statement of group intent, it seems natural to me for divergence to occur over time or between players.  Give the Frodo player one dramatic new encounter, and he may just re-assert his Frodo-ness.  Give him another, and this time he may question and change who Frodo really is.  I've definitely seen that happen in long fantasy campaigns, where The Gruff Barbarian spends a lot of time reaffirming his Gruff Barbarian-ness, but then at some point he jumps into a real personal growth arc, with varying degrees of group engagement around each.                        </div>

                            Well, that's the GNS theory, for what it's worth. The thing about "protagonism" doesn't really mean anything outside that, as far as I know, so if that distinction is without merit, then princess play might be just another form of narrativistic character advocacy? Let me know if that actually matters to someone either way.<br/><br/>It is worthwhile to remember, though, that all creative interest doesn't necessarily hinge on the internal nature of the player character. Many story games make that the centerpiece, but it is possible to play narrativist games with fixed internal character identities (basically an epic instead of a drama), and a Sim game with fluid identities would be possible as well.<br/><br/>(The latter would presumably be an exploratory game, something like "let's try to figure out what it actually felt like to be a grenadier in Napoleon's army." Very fixed external world, and an internal character identity that fluidly conforms to the external reality. Not the same thing as a narrativist premise-charged character, but fluid nevertheless in its own way.)                        </div>

                            The comment about the Czege Principle being less needed or even unwelcome in PP really spoke to my experience, because the Czege Principle is deeply unwelcome in my play,  to the point where I tbh even have trouble understanding the underlying logic of the Czege Principle, because for me, the only interesting trouble is the trouble you create for yourself. <br/><br/>Something I also find interesting is the stuff about fixed characters vs fluid characters, because at first I was thinking I did fluid characters because of the fact that my group and I focus a lot on character development, but then I processed that the way we do it is an unorthodox kind of fixed since the character development is preplanned and basically a fixed part of the character's story.  It just comes into the canon of the fiction piece by piece as we go along, and is largely a product of the fact that with how focused on creating good fiction that tells our characters's stories, a big part of it is making everything fit our fictional assumptions.                        </div>

                            Yeah, expected character change is a really common aspect in princess play games. D&amp;D, which is used for this purpose a lot, has thoroughly enshrined the idea through the last 20 years that the player has a subjective right to plan their character's heroic journey from level 1 to level 20 or whatever in advance all they want. The character's power growth is an important and expected part of the story. That's a very clear example of princess play logic in action, it just doesn't make a whit of sense for nearly any other goal of play.                        </div>

                            That makes sense!<br/>And yeah, it definitely doesn't make sense in other goals of play. With that sort of thing (the whole deeply planned arc thing) being my default method of play all throughout my 10ish years playing RPGs, I find that I sometimes get actively confused by other styles (like the thread I made a few months back trying to understand what interests people in "play to find out"). <br/>I'm rambling at this point and thinking out loud though, which probably isn't terribly useful or constructive.                        </div>

                            I don't see teflon characters played by childish players, not a single example of them. What I've seen is players contracting when the table pushes against their playstyle. Or more often, bringing this from a previous table, then relaxing after 2-3 sessions. Or teflon characters played masterfully by mature and intelligent players. Children insisting their character is teflonian are rare and problematic in my experience. The child cutting edges through negotiation is much more common, as the urge to play is hard to resist : this is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span> childish. I know this doesn't contribute much to the discussion as it can't be proved, but it's me having a hard time with that sort of labels.                        </div>

Hi <a href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">@Dreamer</a> , in my home D&amp;D 4E games we use player-authored Quests and a shared XP pool (as opposed to individual XP). This means whenever one player completes a Quest, everyone at the table gets the XP for it. It helps to support the other players' agendas and interests in play.                        </div>

This made me ponder, what kind of tensions or adversities are endemic to Princess Play (as opposed to those that can exist alongside it), if any? Could a variation of the Czege Principle explain why some SIM players push back against techniques like Mountain Witching that give players agency over defining the world? Doesn't the phrase "Constructive Denial" (for all that it may or may not be useful in defining SIM play) essentially encapsulate the necessary surrender of authority that lies at the heart of the Czege Principle?<br/><br/>I strongly believe that to some degree Princess Play can be (but is not limited to being) a natural result of an RPG paradigm with strongly asymmetrical GM and Player roles; looking at games from that paradigm will probably prove fruitful for isolating techniques that shaped, and ostensibly support, Princess Play.<br/><br/>I also tend to think of it as a manifestation of a kind of Lonely Fun (a term for the sorts of activities people engage in using RPG materials separate from implementing them in a game) in a group, but I'm not entirely sure what the implications of that are. Perhaps sometimes we want to insulate our Princesses from outside influence, but at the same time we also desire the context of something larger to help fully realize them (a sort of RPG Hedgehog's Dilemma)?                        </div>

Mainly, I'd like to hear of the ways that one goes about creating trouble for oneself in a way that is satisfying. Also, how much and what kind of support is needed from other people at the table for that to happen.

                            Okay, so like, to expand on my feelings about the Czege Principle.<br/>There are two big things that I don't feel like can be overstated enough that very much color my perspective here.<br/>1) I'm not really into conflict-based fiction in general, so for me trouble is a tool instead of its own ends. My default paradigm is slice-of-life/iyashikei, where trouble is extremely rare.<br/>2) I approach play completely as an author, not from any kind of in-character stance.<br/><br/>For me, what makes trouble interesting in roleplay is not solving it. It's telling the story of how your character solves it. I don't have any interest in challenge-based stuff where the players are having to figure out how to solve the problem. I'm solely interested in stuff where the focus in a scene involving trouble is the character solving it, where whatever the player chooses for the character to do to solve the problem works unless they say it doesn't. <br/>Scenes where characters are in trouble are scenes where very specific things involving how a character solves problems are being conveyed. Very specific emotions, even more specific than many other sequences that are more nuanced and portray several different things at once. <br/>So thus sequences involving trouble are extremely tight in their choreography, on such a level that it's often easiest to just establish it yourself and solve it yourself, then have the other participants help out by adding details and fancy descriptions. The kind of "improvise within these narrow parameters" like I described in the player expectations thread. Those types of sequences also very much have a major sort of "Follow my lead" built in, with basically the other players riffing off of what the spotlight player is saying and doing and establishing. <br/><br/>Trouble established by other people just has too many failure points as far as potentially turning out unsatisfying through not giving you the chance to convey the emotional content correctly, so thus, for us, the reasonable way to address this problem and make the rare occasions where characters get in trouble interesting and enjoyable is to hand it over completely to the player whose character is going to get in trouble, so that they can make sure everything is as tight as it needs to be for the scene's dramaturgical intent. <br/>It varies from player-to-player how much the rest of the group adds to the sequence, but even in situations where the rest of the group is adding a lot, it's still ultimately set up and resolved by the same person - the spotlight player. <br/><br/>Basically, the most important thing of support needed from the rest of the table is a deep investment in the fiction. When you start basically monologuing out your character's experience of a trouble or conflict, all eyes are on you. Everyone is watching in rapt attention, looking for places they can add additional details, and most of all excited to see how you play out the sequence, how you execute the scene. <br/><br/>Does that help? ^_^                        </div>

                            That also folds well into the solo gaming community where the Czege Principle falls flat.  It doesn't take into account the audience.  [Lots of solo players share their play reports in some form or another.]                        </div>

                            Definitely!<br/>Audience is something that's so important to my group and I. We're very much performing for each other, and one of our major goals is putting on the best performance we can. We've all even done quite a bit of research on acting and improv practices and stuff to make everything as good as we possibly can. <br/>We give each other really detailed notes after each session on stuff we really enjoyed that each participant did in play, and those notes are often very acting-centric (in addition to of course a lot of notes on moments that were just really good writing). One of our players even learned to cry on command to enhance emotional moments in play through more detailed acting of her role.                        </div>

That was indeed very informative! Thank you for the detailed response.<br/><br/>I can see the need for one to take the lead in creating situations. It sounds like it requires everyone to be highly in-tune with what the spotlight player wants. <br/><br/>As the group has played together longer and longer, have you been able to take less of a lead and sort of "surrender" more of the control to other players (assuming that is something you'd want to do at all in the first place)? I can imagine it would require a lot of trust in their ability to "get you" and be in tune with your vision.<br/><br/>I can see myself sort wanting that latter part, but it would require a lot of trust to be built via demonstrations in play that they actually get my vision.  <br/><br/>This is all assuming I'm not misunderstanding what you explained!                          </div>

It's not really subjective or objective so much as it is a characteristic of conflict-centered roleplaying. The causality goes roughly thus:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Roleplaying games are inherently social, as implied by the fact that you bothered to gather a bunch of people together in the first place instead of drawing the curtains and playing alone.<br/><br/><b>2)</b> An understanding of play that focuses on conflict is common and fruitful for a variety of purposes. Conflicts are important, even to the extent of sometimes being the only part of play that actually matters.<br/><br/>When you bring those two observations together, the Czege principle necessarily follows: if your conception of conflict did not imply a social understanding that shares this core content of gameplay between multiple players, then either <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> does not hold (and you therefore should drop the excess players as a complicating factor), or <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> does not hold (and therefore how you handle conflicts doesn't actually matter, because they aren't the actual point of play).<br/><br/>In other words: the Czege principle is not universal, because there are rpg-like activities that are performed alone (e.g. fiction-writing), and there are rpgs where conflict is not of crucial importance, and there are other reasons for a bunch of people to gather to play together.<br/><br/>You could, if you wanted to, generalize the Czege principle so it applies to non-conflict rpgs:<br/><br/><b>The responsibility for the central conceit of your game should be distributed between the players, for otherwise you are creating something with no inherent justification for gathering a gaming group together in the first place.</b><br/><br/>This generalized form can then be applied to Emma's playstyle, too: once you recognize what the other players are there for <i>actually</i>, then you know what is the interaction that needs to be preserved at all costs. Evidently conflict is not it for them if they're happy with a forum-rpg style solipsist character authority. (Alternatively they might have a highly implicit resolution system - e.g. the players debate the outcomes in advance in the abstract, and <b>this</b> is the "conflict" where you want and need other players to participate.)                        </div>

                            Totally with you there, Eero.  Nice.<br/><br/>Here's another take:<br/><br/>One big reason why authoring your character's adversity and resolution isn't fun is because it deprives the situation of meaningful uncertainty for you.<br/><br/>If, however, performance and expression and communication is the goal, and uncertainty is not required for <i>you</i>, but only for your <i>audience</i>, then no fun is lost.  You don't need to be at the edge of your seat if you can keep them at the edge of theirs.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  (Just like a good storyteller GM!)                        </div>

                            I think I've seen some solo play reports in the wild, though, that indicate that some people enjoy the uncertainty of whether a character fails or succeeds, regardless of whether they create the trouble or not. I guess that is an Author sort of stance?<br/><br/>I guess that's a bit of that "doll play" in action, though most often people call attention to the separation of player and character knowledge. I can't say for sure if that's part of what goes on in Princess Play or what Emma described.                         </div>

                            Just to throw it out there (heh), Story Cubes are an example of uncertainty without adversity.  The fun is in the creative challenge to include those elements in your scene or dialogue.                        </div>

                            This is sort of a question I've been thinking about off and on for years now, specifically thanks to <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> talking about four act structure, slice of life, and non-conflict scenes.<br/><br/>Particularly in regards to <i>kishotenketsu</i> (a kind of four act structure found in Chinese, Japanese and Korean stories), I've wondered whether or not a lot of the traditional storygame wisdom about <b>conflict</b> could apply equally to <b>tension</b> and its buildup/resolution.<br/><br/>I am not very good with this sort of narrative theory though and I basically end up going nowhere every time I think about it.                        </div>

                            This is interesting yukamichi. In <i>kishotenketsu</i> it's like the conflict is reversed : projected not in the fiction, but in the reader's mind. It makes me think of a 3rd sort of conflict I call "the conflict of form", where the conflict is in the fiction, but not in the content, in its form. An example : filming a modern western, where the genocide is shown for what it is, with classic western techniques or even references : cinema struggling with itself, with it's history, it's intentions. Interesting, but I am derailing the thread.<br/>I am sure there is no tension whatsoever in Princess Play, on the contrary. It's like wearing kinky clothes and not fearing the others' look : comfy.                        </div>

<blockquote>As the group has played together longer and longer, have you been able to take less of a lead and sort of "surrender" more of the control to other players (assuming that is something you'd want to do at all in the first place)? I can imagine it would require a lot of trust in their ability to "get you" and be in tune with your vision.</blockquote>
We are super super in-tune and trust each other to "get" each other's visions, but there's a big level where we value the way that we do things as far as taking the lead in certain situations. It's kind of a sort of ritual space in a way, if that makes sense, and ritual spaces and ritual structures are something super super important to us in play. <br/>So like, we could theoretically cede more control, and at times we do, but in certain situations, ceding more control just isn't desirable because it doesn't fit the way we all conceptualize the form of a specific sequence.
<blockquote>This generalized form can then be applied to Emma's playstyle, too: once you recognize what the other players are there for actually, then you know what is the interaction that needs to be preserved at all costs. Evidently conflict is not it for them if they're happy with a forum-rpg style solipsist character authority. (Alternatively they might have a highly implicit resolution system - e.g. the players debate the outcomes in advance in the abstract, and this is the "conflict" where you want and need other players to participate.) </blockquote>
Definitely! <br/>What the other players are there for in my group's play is interactions between the characters, and thematic interaction between the arcs of the characters. Without the other protagonists, we wouldn't have a complete story, especially since the story is very centered on the relationships between the character. <br/><br/>For instance in the campaign where I'm playing Sadako, Sadako and Sora (the other PC) have this really involved thematic dichotomy of being reverse mirrors of each other. Sora started out her story really depressed and isolated and in a kind of villainous role, and Sadako started out happy and surrounded by people and very much seen as this paragon of goodness, and over time, Sora made a bunch of friends and learned to cope with her mental illness, and became very much a hero, whereas Sadako has ended up depressed and isolated and suffering, and very much in the process of becoming a villain. Sora is a broken person becoming better, and Sadako was a healthy person who became broken.<br/>There's also been a huge amount of interaction between Sadako and Sora because they're dating, and they have the same friend group. Play is very centered on their relationship in a lot of ways, and their complicated thematic interplay.
<blockquote>One big reason why authoring your character's adversity and resolution isn't fun is because it deprives the situation of meaningful uncertainty for you.<br/><br/>If, however, performance and expression and communication is the goal, and uncertainty is not required for you, but only for your audience, then no fun is lost. You don't need to be at the edge of your seat if you can keep them at the edge of theirs. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (Just like a good storyteller GM!) </blockquote>
Uncertainty is something we don't want either as author or audience, actually. (Our dislike of uncertainty is why we play exclusively diceless, for instance, and a big part of why intricately planned plotting is so important to us.) We're very much all the type of people who even with static fiction reads spoilers before watching a show or reading a book or whatever. For us, a big part of enjoying media is in-depth analysis of it, and we find that knowing what happens first is much better for analysis, because then we can catch things the first time that it would normally take multiple times consuming the piece of media. <br/>This is especially important for us with roleplay, since outside of listening to our recordings, you don't get another shot at picking apart all the imagery and symbolism and meaning and stuff, since getting another shot at it is much more time-consuming than say re-reading a novel, because of the sheer length of our roleplaying campaigns (I mean, our current campaign is currently at 44 sessions that are all about 4-6 hours long, and we have 5 more sessions planned before we finish this story). <br/>Emotionally, we value being caught up in the emotions of the fiction because the fiction is really well-written and well-performed and you care deeply about the characters, instead of being emotionally affected due to not knowing where it's going. Dramatic irony and foreshadowing and other such literary devices are much more important to us than surprise could ever be. (Especially since none of us really even like surprise on any meaningful level.)                        </div>

Focusing on the execution is exactly it! The whole concept of "how it happens" over "what happens". <br/>Small group theatre is I think kind of not a wholly inappropriate way of describing it, tbh, although it's more a writer's room compared with small group theatre, if that makes sense.
<blockquote>I want to echo what David said: your thorough descriptions of your game and the way you put it all together are detailed, fascinating, and a really interesting addition to the forums here. I've learned a lot!</blockquote>
I'm glad you're finding it enjoyable! I'm always worried that I'm rambling too much and boring people, so it's nice to know that people aren't bored.

Creating the better story than we would on our own is very much it! That's a really good way of describing it!

I think it would just be different. I'm not sure it's something I'd totally want, because it would lose a bit of the very intimate, deeply personal feel that our play has, but it's also definitely something I wouldn't be against trying if I had the means to do it!<br/>Our play takes a lot from jeepform larp anyways, so moving further in that direction could be interesting, but I don't think it's how I'd want to play consistently, if that makes sense. ^_^                        </div>

                            This thread is like a treasure full of gems. Really!<br/><br/>On the meaning of protagonism/PP: Have you ever heard the term <b>amplification</b> in terapeutic context? Jung wrote about the function of archetypical stories helping people to get over crisis etc.<br/><br/>Ive heard that in German psychodrama amplification is a fairly common technique. It works something like this: If you cannot cope with a life situation by playing yourself in psychodrama (e.g. because you are unable to locate emotional recources or role strategies for that), then you can get gradually stronger by enacting similar but archetypical stories. So you might play as Harry Potter until you are emotionally ready to face Voldemort and using that 'amplified' experience and enhanced competence you will be better against your tyrannical father etc. I hope this example was clear enough to indicate the connection with PP/Protagonism.<br/><br/>When I talked with my PD professor about RPGs, she said that it sounds like intuitive 'amplification' witnessed among ritualistic tribes. So I see another connection with ritual thinking and bricolage mentioned by <a href="/forums/profile/Silmenume">@Silmenume</a> in the other thread.<br/><br/>Based on these, as <a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a> suggested, the best cure for players fixated on an archetypical character type is to help them grow by enacting those virtues again and again until they are personally 'amplified' enough to move on...<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Also, as a sidenote I just realized that my biggest problem with (Hungarian) trad boffer larps is that if I dont proactively do princess play, nothing interesting happens to me. Of course its about personal taste playstyle, but still... it is kind of sad that from my POV I alone had to bring the fun to the scenes, and no game structure supported me in that.                        </div>

                            On the other hand, once you realize that this is even a possibility in what the game and the other players except of you, then... at least you have something to work towards? I'm about as far from a native princess player as you can get, so I do get the astonishment of everybody questioning the sense in even doing it, but the truth is that it's highly compatible with many traditional game forms, and can be fun. Maybe not the most devastatingly fun that I've ever had, but nevertheless something constructive to be doing, and <i>clearly</i> something that may be the most important single activity to engage in the entirety of roleplaying for some people.<br/><br/>For an example of making the best of a situation, take <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>. It's (potentially, predominantly) a Sim game, and while it's nowhere near focused in princess play specifically, it's not actively contradictory either. In our on-and-off, painfully traditional campaign much of my own amusement and participation in the game has been simple princess play. Being as how the game otherwise would be mostly acknowledging the GM's clues ("yes, let's next go to that place that you mentioned, so we get the next scene"), it's not like I have anything better to do than some light-weight princessing.<br/><br/> (Yes, let's talk about that game a bit here. You see, the campaign in question is also essentially an exercise in Spicy dice game mechanics. The GM has pretensions about sorta-old-school "let the dice land as they may" play, but at least to me it's obvious that the dice are there more for moment-to-moment narrative inspiration. A good example of a game that, for me, is mostly princess play + Spicy dice.)<br/><br/>Not having anything better to do in CoC than princess away, my first character in the campaign became a biker, veteran of the Korean war (the campaign is set in the American west in the '50s) with some criminal connections. The entertainment about playing this character is getting to talk about '50s biker culture, drug trade, veteran issues and his shaky mental health situation (made worse by certain mythos-related breakdowns as play progresses, of course). For example, I found it mildly entertaining that it was specifically my character who had a contact with a veteran friend with explosives expertise who could come in and solve a mythos problem in the traditional way; the scenes related to that not only let me do some minor thespian stuff with myself (playing both the PC and their contact, basically), but also handle the minutiae with the explosives, which the rest of the group were completely unprepared to handle in a manner approaching realistic.<br/><br/>(To clarify: it is completely obvious to me that had my character not been in the adventure, the explosives and whatnot would simply have appeared on their own. "We go buy some dynamite" and then "we use the dynamite to blow up the entrance" and that's that. It would be a misunderstanding to imbue any kind of plot relevance to that play content.)<br/><br/>When the first character took an extended sanitarium stay at one point, as one is wont to do in CoC, I created a second character. This time I went with a clever and academically accomplished young woman who happened to be the mildly-infatuated assistant of the local Gandalf-type NPC at the University of Arizona. Playing her was most fun when she did anthropological field study, wrestled with her mythos-skepticism and tried to keep the too-curious-for-his-own-good professor from outright throwing himself into insane worship of the old gods for anthropological purposes. Basically, doing what the character existed for.<br/><br/>For both characters it has generally been much less entertaining to have to handle the adventure-related things that are not character identity relevant. This is clearly princess play attitude speaking here: when the character doesn't react in an interesting and unique manner to what's going on, I'm not being entertained by being that character - I could just be giving instructions to any generic space-holder.<br/><br/>Pay attention, if you please, to the relatively high-brow nature of my princessing entertainment with these characters: this is what I mean by CoC not being particularly supportive of princess play. I think that the reason that I'm even able to do it in a game that insists on a historical setting and overall realistic characters is a deeper than average interest in cultural history and humanist arts in general, meaning that I know enough about the setting to embed a sufficiently colorful and specific character in it. My biker-veteran character, for example, wouldn't be interesting if I didn't know about American biker subculture and its historical underpinnings; the GM certainly doesn't have the technical means in CoC to somehow grant the player the necessary background for princessing effectively in the setting, so you're on your own and you're only going to be as entertained as you can be on your own strengths. <br/><br/>To illustrate: another player ended up playing a young hoodlum sort of character. We helped them conceptualize the character a bit by determining that they're specifically a greaser, a type of youth subculture prevalent in the '50s USA landscape. However, to actually be successful in princessing the player would actually have to have the vision and wherewithal to discover something interesting in their own character to portray and inhabit; somebody who doesn't know what a greaser is, and is otherwise entirely clueless about American 20th century history (and their own for that matter), simply isn't going to benefit from something like "you could be a greaser, how about?" It is an entirely empty label to them.<br/><br/>The type of princess play I describe there constitute about 50% of my entire participation in the campaign, it's all like that - chatting about what my character thinks about things and how they do this or that thing that needs to be done. The other parts are 10% pacing stuff (keeping the investigator party on track and moving the way the GM expects us to) and 40% general audience/support/kibitzing commentary. I even did a whole 4-session adventure without a character of my own, so the princessing isn't <i>crucial</i>, but I have to say that it is a core part of the game having any point at all - if <i>nobody</i> had characters in this, it'd become painfully thin.<br/><br/>Also, consider this: setting aside the difficulty threshold for princess play that CoC causes by its relatively impenetrable setting and style, the gaming procedures are precisely the same as in any other traditional game. The vast majority of roleplaying games are systematically, moment to moment, precisely as princess play friendly as CoC. This means that while they do not actively obstruct, they certainly do not support it either. Historically concerned design towards princess play has been very sparse, particularly as the whole indie revolution basically bypassed this type of creative concern entirely. It is obvious that there are all sorts of things one could do to actively help people towards successful princessing - more than the vapid advice about "developing a character concept" or "giving your character a tick" that game texts like to offer.<br/><br/>Thinking about a baseline - is there an essentially better princessing game out there in the rpg text land than <i>Exalted</i> or <i>Fate</i>? Is that the absolute state of the art, warts and all, or is there some other, more potent strain of development that I'm currently not thinking about?<br/><br/>(Somebody might bring up <i>Amber</i>, but I'll leave that aside for now if nobody minds. A complex topic.)<br/><br/>EDIT: Jeepform is, of course, superior. Yes. It is also essentially detached from many parts of the tabletop rpg tradition that I enjoy myself, so... I would, other things being equal, rather play Exalted myself. But yes, Nordic freeform does its own thing well.                        </div>

                            I think <i>Shinobigami</i> is also super Princessy by virtue of its round-robin, player-directed scenes. If I want to play a character who sneaks through ventilation ducts, then god help me, come my turn I am going to work a ventilation duct into the scene for me to sneak through. The whole game is basically set up for you to show off your thing.<br/><br/>I imagine that's a lot like Fate in the "My claws go 'Snikt!'" way but not necessarily in the "Compelling my alcoholism" way.                        </div>

I feel like Chuubo's is realistically the ideal PP game, since expressing the character's identity is a huge part of the core of what the game is, and when plot material happens, it's all character arc stuff, so everything is playing to character without the points you run into in other games where there's stuff that doesn't pertain to the characters and where if you're solely into PP, you're basically just sitting around being bored.<br/><br/>A pretty large amount of the rules in Chuubo's also are devoted to maintaining in-game fidelity to your vision of the character and their story. For instance, there's a mechanic where if your character is injured, you can spend a resource to basically rewrite that injury to make it fit what you want to do with the character. This doesn't just include physical injuries. It also includes stuff like curses, metaphysical compulsions, etc. Basically, anything happening to your character that you'd rather didn't happen, for whatever reason.                         </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> Any Fortune-in-the-Middle type game could easily support Princess Play, with Otherkind being the goto example; if everyone at the table was on the same page. Danger Patrol also would easily support it. With Danger Patrol, I think the assumption that  Princess Play is what you will be doing is built into the game.                        </div>

                            Otherkind Dice?<br/><br/>In my opinion, that's the opposite of Princess Play-supporting. Vincent even put a warning on those rules: "beware! These will chew your characters to pieces!" (Or something like that.)<br/><br/>But I suppose that if the group were REALLY REALLY careful about naming the dangers, maybe they could make it work. Maybe. I've never seen it in practice.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, though, giving up on one thing you want because of something else you want is not desirable for Princess Play - it's pretty high stakes stuff.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>I found Vincent's quote on this. (And, having played a lot of Otherkind Dice type games, I couldn't agree more.)
<blockquote>By nature, those rules are no respecter of characters. They will tear your limbs off and cut out your guts. It happened to my poor guy.<br/><br/>But if you hobble them and play them safe instead, which you can easily do, they stumble and stagger and are awkward. It's very hard to reliably come up with three interesting safe things.</blockquote> </div>

                            Yes. I was thinking more about the narration distribution and the stakesetting and player control of the resolution, but I can see your point, Paul. It was a bad call on my part.<br/><br/>I am still putting Danger Patrol forward as a most capable Princess Play game.                        </div>

                            Perhaps I'm misunderstanding some of the whole PP thing, but I was imagining that Emma's PP was more of an outlier ( although definitely PP. More like PP on steroids than anything else).<br/><br/>I never imagined PP meant no trouble at all was involved, rather that the player might well both introduce and resolve trouble.<br/><br/>The Wolvie player might, for example, introduce all sorts of superhero appropriate trouble for their own character, but they would also have control over how it resolved ( although, if played socially, involving incorporating other players' suggestions voluntarily).<br/><br/>Under this assumption, all sorts of terrible things might happen to Wolvie. It's just that those terrible things would be a result of choices to have those terrible things occur made by Wolvie's player, rather than by another person ( including the mechanics designer).<br/><br/>I'm not positive I'm correct in this, but it does fit with the type of proto-RP we did as kids, especially when playing canon characters in high adventure settings. I don't know ow many times poor old Han Solo got shot/captured/beat down/had the Millennium Falcon Stolen/Had the Millennium Falcon shot  swiss-cheesed by TIE fighters/etc when I played as him, all introduced and resolved by me.                        </div>

                            I would say a completely hermetic character protection is atypical. It is logical, though. Forum play of the type "you can't do anything to another player's character without their prior consent" operates on the same principles. This doesn't mean that characters never face something that narratively resembles trouble, but the player is ultimately in control in some way.<br/><br/>I think that consequences have to be carefully modulated somehow for princess play to be safe and fun. Maybe the consequences are commonplace and their nature known in advance, for example, in which case the princess character concept can incorporate them as future possibilities. Or maybe the player gets a veto or choice about what kind of failure or price their character will pay. Or maybe the players work hard to understand each other's character concepts so they can avoid upsetting them.<br/><br/>Without some sort of modulation Wolverine is constantly on the mercies of the whims of the other players, and what's worse, the game often actively celebrates ruining him. It's <i>great</i> that he lost a battle due to bad dice rolls against an enemy that shouldn't conceptually be a match for him. It may be great for some creative agenda, but not for a princess player who's specifically committed to a character vision where Wolverine is the best at what he does, not some random goblin with the dice luck.<br/><br/>Interestingly I don't think that <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is much of a problem in this regard despite being a rather character-disruptive game. You know your character's likely going insane or getting injured or killed at some point, so it doesn't need to come as a horrible disruption of your princess play concept. It's not a good vehicle for power fantasy (although our GM does facilitate that much more than I would), but it's just fine for misery tourism as long as the group has the sense to let a player take the lead in orchestrating the demise of their own character. Arguably that's one of the big creative payoffs of the game: knowing that you're a Lovecraft protagonist, and getting to organize your own march towards your inevitable doom.<br/><br/>Old school D&amp;D in comparison is awful: it's intentionally a refusal and corruption of heroic fantasy tropes. It encourages hope, yet crushes it. Any control a player has is fleeting. Having players dislike the game because it is so very cruel towards princess play is the most common single creative agenda conflict I experience with the game.                        </div>

                            Cthulhu PP is one that runs up against genre expectations, no?<br/><br/>In that case, you're gladly joining into the death/madness spiral, much like Action Heroes taking a number of beatdowns along the way.<br/><br/><br/>I suppose that Cthulhu play could be made more PP in some fashion, however. It is an interesting thought experiment: How does one make Cthulhu gaming more amenable to Princess Play.<br/><br/>Also, as an aside, I think I've been partially confusing what is being called Princess Play with Magic Tea Party Play.<br/><br/>Is it just that the two often go together, but are different things?<br/><br/>Magic Tea Party Play: Events of play are less about adventure of any sort, and more about an opportunity to get to play at being your Princess around other Princesses. Could be a literal tea party, could just as easily be a gathering at the Elysium in a VtM Larp. Not sure exactly what it would be in Superhero play. Avengers:Infinity War maybe? The original 1980s Secret Wars storyline?<br/> </div>

                            Yeah, I think that tea-party play is another one of these "stances" towards Sim play like princess play and dollhouse play. It's not exactly the same, but as I speculated earlier, I don't really think that you're actually forced to choose just one - it's entirely feasible for a single game to shift between these various activities fluidly as play goes on. Some games are very focused on just one or two of these, while others are more generic.<br/><br/>So yeah, add that one to the list I was making earlier of different Sim activities. Definitely counts, good call. There are games that distinctly set up tea-partying - I'm reminded of Ars Magica myself, with its periodic wizard conclaves.<br/><br/>The main difference between princessing and tea-partying is, I think, that the former assumes an archetypal character activity context, while the latter specifically presumes a social scene framework. Your character identity might not have a relatable interface for social scenes at all, so you can't princess with them at a tea-party, but it's also possible that tea-parties are a structural part of what the game even is (like a Vampire LARP), so everybody's going to join in regardless of character concept.<br/><br/>This means that if your character's princessing activity <b>specifically is</b> having tea-parties (or club raves or orgies or whatever), then there's no meaningful distinction for you between getting to play a tea-party scene or getting to play a princessing scene: the tea-party scene works just fine for expressing your character. A literal princess character in most fiction will be like this: having a tea-party or a royal ball or something like that will usually work to highlight their character and show them in their element.<br/><br/>Compare, on the other hand, to Wolverine: he has to occasionally participate in a tea party (also known as "X-Men social group-building activity"), and depending on the type of party he's probably not going to be princessing there. The scene may well still be fun for tea-party reasons, but it's not going to be fun because it enables Wolverine to be Wolverine. At best it's an opportunity to showcase Wolverine's unique social style, but if that's not what interests the player in Wolverine, then it's not princess play for them.<br/><br/>(For the comic book geeks: yes, Wolverine has his own social interface style in his solo stories. I can see princess playing him at a tea party, provided it's a Japanese one where he gets to be the broody white guy samurai. He also has this brooding working man's alcoholic stance that fills in for an actual social life. That's the real Wolverine, though, and not the armchair-theory type we're discussing here.)                        </div>

                            Expression / description with respect to action. It's been called the paradigmatic axis of the story : if you draw the story from left to right, these techniques produce variations on a vertical axis. See in "In the mood for love" or such movies where we're shown how the story could go this way or that way, and it never goes anywhere. I use the "slow motion" signal to get that effect : zooming in the scene, adding ornamental, expressive details. This can be a summary of scenes though, it's not about time passing, it's about immersing in the meaning and nuances and not getting close to the Goal. The clutch is on again when this evolves into clear fictional maneuvering. In a way, it always is, more or less.                        </div>

                            Eero'a thoughts on "tea party" play reminds me of a really eye opening RPG session I had as a young teenager.<br/><br/>We had a regular D&amp;D game going, and one night the GM didn't show up.<br/><br/>One of the players said, "No problem. Let's start, and when he shows up he can tell us what the adventure is."<br/><br/>So, we described the adventurers sitting around a table in a tavern (this was teenage D&amp;D, after all!), and we each started telling each other stories, in character.<br/><br/>"Let me tell about how we slew the Black Beast of Nikrath - we lost two good fighting men on that expedition..."<br/><br/>The GM never showed up, but we had a great time.<br/><br/>Tea Party play, right? It was eye opening and a surprisingly enjoyable evening.<br/><br/>I'm less interested in such things these days, but conceptually it makes total sense to me.<br/><br/>Another example I can think of is groups who design, say, D&amp;D or GURPS characters and then make them fight each other. There's usually no real fictional context; they're just testing out character builds, although some people will create a little bit of a fictional "mortal combat tournament" or some such.                         </div>

                            Yeah, the former is tea party play, I think. The latter is system monkeying.<br/><br/>We did a bit of the latter earlier in the fall for a one-shot session here, in fact. My elder brother visited, and for some reason lost to time this is often a time when he brings his Hero System books and we mess about with it a bit. A one-shot of Hero System doesn't actually mean anything (it's basically impossible to get anything unique out of it in that time-frame), but that seems to be his thing.<br/><br/>My increasingly refined conception of Sim play enabled me to suggest a session of character building instead of a hurried adventure; we ended up spending the evening attempting to model "Guts" of <i>Berserk</i> manga fame in Hero System, led by a third member of the troupe. My personal creative agenda in this exercise was to draw another player into discussing prior art they like - in this case, Berserk. I thought that Hero System had potential as a vehicle of discussion, although it's clearly not as optimized for modeling as I would like. (I don't really want to say what it <b>is</b> optimized for; it's one of those legacy systems where a clear answer may not exist.) The night was a success in the sense that we got to talk a lot about Berserk and what exactly goes on in it and who and what Guts is as a character. On the other hand, we never got around to building a second character so we could have the versus battle I originally envisioned. Hero System is pretty slow work.<br/><br/>For the record, the ideal modeling system would be one where it is entertaining and enlightening to interpret and define prior art into the rules system, and the rules are opinionated about the internal significance for different choices. Hero System has this in a big way on a few key aspects related to superhero comics, with the distinction between bashing damage and lethal damage taking pride of place. For the most part I feel that it's more vague and dull than would be ideal, though, due to the way it requires you to take hard stances on teleological questions like "what does it mean that Guts has a big sword" very far in advance of actual play. (You literally have to decide things like "how many points of damage would I like Gut's sword to do", with the system being completely unable to accept an answer like "however much is appropriate for a sword and swordsman of this size, build and skill" - my knowing and being able to describe and gauge the latter three diegetic facts is no help whatsoever in setting the mechanical damage number.)                        </div>

                            I personally believe that princess play is the secret recipe to success in modern D&amp;D. The slow and complex combats are still a drag (speaking after 25 sessions of 4th edition here), but a princess play attitude makes the best of even that stuff. Definitely better than trying to play challenge-oriented ("how many orcs can a 3rd level Fighter take?") or something like that.<br/><br/>This of course only means something if you can enjoy princess play.                        </div>

                            To me it was about leaving the OSR and trad RPG territory in two different ways.<br/><br/>1. First, by putting calculation and cautiousness  aside and trying to embrace some sort of 'heroic masculinity' and immerse in a character who values honor and martial glory over survival and wealth similarily to mythical/epic (in a Homeric way) heroes. <br/><br/>I think a lot of players have done this intuitively.<br/><br/>It is a challenge for me as a person but I am committed. One could say that I started using D&amp;D as a self-help method. It is called 'amplification' in psychodramatic fields.<br/><br/>I satyrically nicknamed this playstyle 'Jordan Peterson fantasy' to one of my playmates but actually I'm semi-serious about the name. 'Be a man!'<br/><br/>2. The other change is that I previously played OSR games as an exploration of premade content. Mainly in the traditional sense (GM made dungeon &amp; plot), but also in the Forgite meaning of exploring emergent propierties of interesting rule-systems!<br/><br/>What lies in the next room? What is the treasure? What happens if I poke the idol  with my 10 feet pole?<br/><br/>But also: What happens if I use this cool feat/sub-system?<br/><br/>The problem is that D&amp;D is boring to me system-wise and WotC modules also leave me hungry for more. Its just not what I call satisfying.<br/><br/>I think my problem was that I played trad games differently than indie hippie games. I played them as an active agent in the fiction but only in an audience-sense. What do I see? What happens if I do this? This is how simulations work (not in Big Theory sense)!<br/><br/>I started to play D&amp;D Story Game wise. Like I'm an audience but also an entertainer. I changed my attitude to play similarily to the performers of Critical Role. <br/><br/>One could say that both things are about stance. So I went from an 'educated muderhobo' to an 'epic protagonist' and from an 'explorer of a simulator' to a 'self-expressing performer'.<br/><br/>Does that help in any way? (The question definitely helped my to better articulate and understand myself so thank you <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>!)                        </div>

I think this is huge.  I realized this is a big part of what I enjoy as a player (in this kind of explore a fantastical adventure site game).  My character's wise (Ugly Truth) lets me help on rolls by being brutally honest or sharply observant.  I think a lot of my enthusiasm can come from thinking "The other players are gonna love this".<br/><br/>I think this is supported by Torchbearer's end-of-session Embodiment award.  Identifying the big moment of character roleplay is mechanically significant, and it's the players who decide what that was.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Is it still Princess play, then ? It's beginning to dawn on me that it's Princess play alright, just done right, that is : made sort of "visible to the game mechanics".<br/><br/>Maybe it's a different topic, but I am thirsty of info on the effect of these awards on roleplay. I read the game and dug through lots of AP videos (not my kind of fun) and I still don't see them different from, say, White Wolf XP awards (if you made them each end of session).

                            You're essentially asking whether it is possible to princess play without other players providing a sounding board and audience. I'd say that you can perform something in that ballpark whether the other players expect and appreciate it or not. Sort of like how you can address premise in the narrativist sense whether the other players are on board or not. Chances are that the others don't want you to do it unless they're in active support.<br/><br/>The practical creative issue for the other players is often that they might not be interested in seeing how your particular character concept reacts to various situations; unless they support princess play, they might be expecting you to perform some entirely perpendicular function instead. In D&amp;D, for example, they might expect you to perform your tactical role flawlessly, so their reaction to any princess play antics that contradict this mission will be frustration - they don't want to see you dropping any flashlights when there are monsters to slay.<br/><br/>If we assumed an entirely uncaring group, though, then it's essentially a Zilchplay scenario, isn't it? You do your thing, but nobody cares because there's no artistic connection. "Yeah yeah, you do funny voices. Is it my turn already?"<br/><br/>In practical terms I usually find that roleplayers often expect princess play to occur. It is, after all, written into the genetics of most traditional games. They call it "roleplaying" when your character reacts to a situation in a character-specific way.                        </div>

                            Dave,<br/><br/>Good questions! I'll leave those to hamnacb...<br/><br/>But I want to ask about this:<br/><br/>It's only in D&amp;D that you didn't feel "switching to macho heroism" wouldn't pan out? Is that because you're playing in particularly lethal games of D&amp;D?<br/><br/>In my experience, it's much harder to die in most versions of modern D&amp;D than in GURPS...<br/><br/>If not, what's the difference you're seeing or experiencing?                        </div>

I'm not in sync with this particular group but I certainly entertain them. <br/><br/>The GM is one of my best playmate who is a cool Story Gamer but very inexperienced in trad GMing. He is very anxious about this task. The other player... well... tries to roll high I guess? We are playing over roll20 so I dont know him well. <br/><br/>They are definitely my audience, but only I perform in this group. So its kind of semi-lonely fun with little synergy. (This is why the self-help aspect stands out!)<br/><br/>Also, I think they still dont know for sure if they enjoy TLMoP. I certainly do!                        </div>

<b>TL;DR</b><br/><br/><b>My background</b><br/><br/>I remember that when D&amp;D 3E came out, we were playing it intuitively. It always sucked.<br/><br/>I have an amateur / improv acting background but I never tried mix acting into trad RPGs. They were totally different things for me. Maybe I was too rigid about it.<br/><br/>So I got into early Forge games but I often<br/>got disappointed too. Good games, but the way my group played them usually didnt match my expectations.<br/><br/>Then around 2007 I jumped right into the forming OSR scene. I was always a compliant person so I fully immersed myself in its ethos.<br/><br/>I never ever tried playing macho heroism in OSR games (I think you would die trying under level 9)<br/>but I always enjoyed it most when I could play the flashlight or do some drama (letting my cool PC die in a very Horwardian way, etc.).<br/><br/>When games like Fiasco came out they became my favourite exactly because everyone have to play in the same way. No mechanics distract you.<br/><br/><b>The moral?</b><br/><br/>I was playing RPGs more than a 'system matters' way, adhering strictly to the rules. This was a huge mistake!!!<br/><br/>I cannot get any real fun from trad games this way. I tried so hard to no avail! D&amp;D 3-5E <i>as rules purely</i> are just simply boring and dull (i think this is a 'fact'). Even OSR games always lacked something for me in the long run (this one is clearly about taste and creative agenda). <br/><br/>I was too compliant for years. If you have the same sensibilities, dont follow that path. It will lead you to frustration.<br/><br/>Try to forget the rules and just play your character in a cooperative, constructive way. Basically you leave the original 'game' and start a new one: How could I best entertain the others by enacting my cool character concept?<br/><br/>A natural counterargument might arise: 'But I'm a polite person. I do not want to break others game by forcing my princess play on them.'<br/><br/>Forget this shit! Other players are doing the same hijacking on D&amp;D since ages and thats totally okay?<br/><br/>New school D&amp;D has no written creative agenda. If you didnt agree on something beforehand with the group, everything goes.<br/><br/>If a game dont give you fun naturally, go and get your fun out from it in a constructive way!<br/><br/><b>A sidenote</b><br/><br/>Playing this way also made me realize something else. Sure, I rolled when I had to, but performing took so much energy from me (no problem) that I would not mind if the GM just rolled for me all the time.<br/><br/>So the players who constantly complain about that the rolling breaks their immersion might do this style intuitively!<br/><br/>Remember Critical Roll players forgetting which dice to roll even after years of playing? Now I dont think there is anything particularly unbelieveable about it!                        </div>

                            I've been there. It's harsh.<br/><br/>On the bright side, you offered the group an opportunity to affirm their commitment to real lethal combat stakes. If the campaign's figured out how to make use of that, it could be quite valuable to be able to prove like that the characters do really die if the dice fall that way.<br/><br/>(If it was just your character who could die, because your play style annoyed the GM, then that's less good, of course.)                        </div>

                            I think my PC died for three reasons:<br/>1. I consciously did not play him in a purely tactical way. I could have more optimal actions, but I was focusing on heroic portrayal and not minmaxing. This was my choice.<br/>2. I rolled badly and the goblins rolled well. It happens in D&amp;D, it was part of my expections. (Of course, a PP GM could run fights like <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> did, without real danger of death)<br/>3. The GM upgraded the 2 PCs to 2nd level to better match the original number of goblins but I think it was not balanced enough. Double HP is not equal to the double number of attacks / round.<br/><br/>Man, I have never thought I would whine about balance... I started to empathize with another type of 'bad' player <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Truthfully, it sounds pretty common to me.<br/><br/>It sounds like much the thing I would have done in the past, a sort of ad hoc way of trying to bend the game to what I actually wanted it to be, without taking much time to actively consider either what I actually wanted, how to get it, or what the long term impact of those kinds of repeated and expanded upon  ad hoc changes would end up being.                        </div>

                            Paul, the goal is "seems like the PCs have a chance".  Depending on who's judging it, that appearance could be misleading.                        </div>

                            Enh… don't know about that advice. <br/><br/>IME, a lot of mainstream-only gamers ( and more so D&amp;D primarily/exclusively players) are will and truly hooked on the idea that character death must be a possibility in game, even while regularly creating ad hoc patches to make it doesn't happen in anything but the most undeniable circumstances. Most would be appalled that you'd even think of taking character death  ( save at owing player's discretion) off the table officially.<br/><br/><br/>Part of it, from the GM end ( and this relates o Paul_T's post) is simply that PC death is a pain in the ass. In some ways, a TPK is less of a hassle than individual PC death. If it's a TPK, all the players have to start over with new characters. If just one or two get knocked off, they're out of play until new characters are generated <b>and</b> the fictional progress is bent in such a way that the new characters can be introduced and accepted into the party.<br/><br/>In a couple ways, TTRPGs are really lagging behind the developments of both video games and TT miniatures campaign games, both of which tend to allow a temporary death" and a restart point that doesn't dump you all the way back at the beginning.                        </div>

                            For what it's worth, I feel as if this distinction is less than useful. People aren't platonic ideals or Absolute Character Focus or Absolute Playing To Find Out What Happens. There's a back-and-forth to it, from scene to scene and session to session. <br/><br/>Like if I'm playing an Infernal in Monsterhearts and she's a hot mess who uses sex as a band-aid for her abandonment issues and whose demonic life coach is subtly undermining her by making perfectly reasonable recommendations to her, just couched in language that she's certain to rebel against then I'm definitely playing to find out whether Jaime can figure out how to have healthy relationships, learn to trust other people, and get out from under Redmaw's thumb.<br/><br/>But I'm also in it to portray someone who lives by swinging back and forth from new experience to new experience to cover up the fact that she's got some pretty heavy problems that she's not dealing with (something that I've dealt with personally, myself). Now this is a character trope, this is a part I'm playing that bounces off of other folks in the group in particular ways that are awesome to play out and participate in, but that doesn't erase the fact that I will lose no sleep if Jaime suffers, or changes, or shifts her focus. <br/><br/>I don't disagree necessarily that straight-up playing to do a cool thing ad-nauseum while not really encountering any real stakes is a thing people do, but I think that there's a much thinner line between character-as-part-of-theme and character-as-embodiment of enjoyable-trope than folks here are acknowledging. To say otherwise is to ignore the little thrill that you get asking your rugged mannish protector "What about second breakfast?" in the midst of answering the question "How far does being a rural British gentleman get you against Satan?"                         </div>

                            I'm comfortable discussing whether GNS theory holds any water, but the tail end of a thread on something remotely related probably isn't the place. For what it's worth, I think that distinctive labeling can be valuable for perceiving and understanding phenomena even if you ultimately conclude that what you are seeing is merely a matter of degree rather than of quality.<br/><br/>Then again, a holistic view can also be valuable, assuming it reflects real phenomena. Analytical and syncretic perspectives are best wielded in tandem, I feel.<br/><br/>Totally not intending to shut down that discussion, it's just that I have limited tools for talking about whether princess play mixes well with story now without making it a lengthy general exercise in theoretical concept-finessing that pretty much engages that whole theoretical chassis. Princess play is, ultimately, merely an empirical context for something like that, rather than its subject matter proper. A lot depends on what precise stratum of human experience is indicated by various words.                        </div>

                            That's more or less what I was getting at though: I think that it meshes perfectly fine with story now play (or if you want to put a more general spin on it "playing to find out what happens") because it's part of a continuum or spectrum rather than a matter of starkly defined categories. <br/><br/>I would propose princess play is more akin to a stance than a philosophy or goal of play. It's not quite pure Actor stance, since a part of it is maneuvering your character into different story beats: this is where Wolvie bucks Cyclop's orders, this is where Wolvie violently slaughters everyone who threatens a little girl, this is where Wolvie shows off his past as a samurai. There's an element of Author stance here, in that the player is moving their character into position to make those beats. <br/><br/>With characters or tropes whose whole deal is their arc, this can also include a subtle version of Director's stance where you as a player build the fiction to include stuff like The Guy Who Knows Wolverines Secret Past and The Teammate He Has Awkward And Ill Advised Sexual Tension With. It's usually expressed as an explanation for some sort of mysterious behavior that the character engages in, and meant to be an extension of Their Thing. <br/><br/>"I put a coin before the shrine of the Sea-Bitch Umberlee, looking out into the dark waters before me. Faedamious once lost someone to the sea, and while he is not a man of faith he hopes that their soul is at rest."-Look guys, I just inserted by necromancer's dead son into the narrative. <br/><br/>"Where were you Logan?"<br/><br/>"Tyin' up loose ends Professor. Tyin' up loose ends. His claws are caked with dried blood, but it is obvious he is not satisfied."-Look guys, I just inserted a mysterious quest for vengeance into the narrative. <br/><br/>I agree that it's important to construct categories for different types of play so that folks can easily ascertain what sort of play is their thing and talk about it openly and honestly. With that in mind, I think that it's most productive to talk about this sort of pattern as a continuum and figuring out where you fall on the continuum by answering these questions: <br/><br/>1. What's more important to you during play: facts about your character, or questions and answers?  <br/><br/>2.  Do you want your character to change significantly during play, and if so how much do you want these changes to be under your control? How do you want the system to enforce this, if at all? <br/><br/>3. You do you have a plan for where your character is going, or are you in this to see what happens to them, and how they change as a result? How invested are you in both of these? <br/><br/>So categorization via sliders rather than boxes, essentially.                         </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/johnthedm7000">@johnthedm7000</a> agreed on the back-and-forth.  Part of my difficulty in wrapping my head around the "princess play" label is distinguishing it from what we all do all the time when we're wearing someone else's skin in our imaginations.  I mean, I know that not all RPG play includes that "wearing their skin" thing... but a <i>huge</i> spectrum of it does.<br/><br/>At the same time, I think the "entertain yourself" component is really useful to understand, when it applies.  So I think threads like this are great for pointing out that that's a thing.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a> I didn't mean take character death off the table, I just meant turn down the dial to the point where acting like a somewhat-reasonable hero is unlikely to get you killed.

This might not be helpful, but here's how the technique vs. agenda divide generally goes in Forgite analysis - I know you've seen this kind of thinking before:<br/><br/>"I imagine a person and wrap this imaginary personality around myself..." <b>- technique</b><br/>"... to satisfy my personal issues with that character type." <b>- agenda</b><br/><br/>"I imagine a person and wrap this imaginary personality around myself..." <b>- technique</b><br/>"... to provide authentic automatic-writing input into the game situation." <b>- agenda</b><br/><br/>"I write fan-fiction about Wolverine..." <b>- technique</b><br/>"... to satisfy my personal issues with that character type." <b>- agenda</b><br/><br/>People often have issues with identifying the creative agenda in actual play. Some think that this is because "creative agenda" doesn't exist (as a coherent thing) or cannot possibly be observed, and the various people who think that the concept makes sense are just all looking at different kinds of technical cues and projecting their own biases. My own favourite explanation is that because the creative agenda is a psychological process going on in the mind of a game participant, we simply don't have any means of directly observing it, and thus the only way to talk about it to each other is by comparing experiences and classifying similar psychological mechanisms together under one label - and that always boils down to "hey, I've seen that" or "no, I haven't ever experienced that, so it might not even exist". It's a tricky subject.<br/><br/>This being the situation, I can only hide behind the definition: what I tried to name with "princess play" is a certain kind of creative agenda I observe (or think I do, at least) in the wild, associated with certain techniques (role-inhabitation). If you can see the technique part, but doubt that the agenda part exists, then I don't really have any clever arguments against that. Maybe you're right and I'm just imagining some instances of role-play to be engaged in for different purposes than some others. As you say, the technical idea of "playing a role" is used constantly for all sorts of purposes in actual play.<br/><br/>Maybe this hypothetical question would be interesting: when a 5-year old girl does role-immersion play around, say, being a princess, and gains great delight in being called pretty (or otherwise acknowledged as a princess) by adults as they flounce around in a costume - what do you think the creative agenda is there? What's going on in her head, in terms of play satisfaction?<br/><br/>You might answer that we don't know, because all people are different and this little girl might have one of many different motivations. My current theory, though, is that she's probably engaging in recontextualizing of the self by imagining an alternate identity, being entertained by the way a different social mask makes them feel, and that this is a pretty typical form of the Simulationistic agenda mode - it's basically a major answer to the question of "why would I want to pretend to be an elf". I also think that I can differentiate this particular type of creative agenda from some other reasons somebody might have for taking on a role, the way you usually would distinguish between creative agendas in practical observation.<br/><br/>Another hypothetical question might also help: if I hypothetically design and play a game revolving primarily around princess play as I understand it, do you think that I'll find any players who'd like playing that, and what kind of creative reasons they might have for liking it? Would they have coherent reasons? (In concrete terms a "princess play" game would involve unique and detailed player characters engaging in various situations that enable different characters to have different specific reactions; there would be both GM-initiated and player-initiated situations, and expressing the unique individual reactions of each character would be a major part of play.)<br/><br/>By the way, an excellent example of a game that I suspect could be very princess play -friendly just occurred to me: <i>Wushu</i> seems like it does almost nothing but princess play. I can't even figure out why somebody would want to play that if not because they're entertained by princessing.<br/><br/>I don't know why you don't think that you can distinguish between princess play and other reasons to role-immerse, but one reoccurring reason I've noticed for somebody not "seeing" a creative agenda is that they don't have sufficient similar experiences themselves, and thus don't understand what they see. This tends to lead, I think, to mischaracterization of the agenda: you observe some play and try to figure out what the players are doing, what they're getting out of it, and you miss the real reason because it's outside your personal life experience.<br/><br/>The other explanation would of course be that the distinctive psychology that I posit for "princess play" does not actually exist, and thus the situation is precisely as you say: we have a whole bunch of examples of role-immersion used as a technique of play, but because the type of creative agenda I posit as an underlying explanation does not exist, it's no wonder you can't distinguish it from some others that clearly aren't anything like the princess play I try to describe.                        </div>

                            These four things all make sense to me individually:<br/>- fleeting individual princess play<br/>- ongoing individual princess play<br/>- fleeting group princess play<br/>- ongoing group princess play<br/><br/>I'm just having some trouble staying clear on which is being discussed at any given time.<br/><br/>I'm also hamstrung in the creative agenda discussion by having the Forge concepts etched in my brain that "creative agenda" is a group endeavor, not an individual one, and that one might best find it by looking at long-term reward cycles, not moments.<br/><br/>In my experience, momentary or fleeting princess play is common, and says little about long-term group play, while ongoing individual princess play is less common, and can be integrated or not in a variety of ways depending on what else the group is up to.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever seen ongoing group princess play.  I can imagine it, though, and in my imagination it seems quite fun.<br/><br/>So, overall, I definitely agree with you, Eero, that "being entertained by the way a different self-context or social mask makes you feel" is a thing that happens... I'm just not sure how best to fit that into my theoretical framework.<br/><br/>I played in a Werewolf game that was kinda sorta Gamist by habit on the large scale, but most of our highlights were quite plausibly fleeting group princess play.  Every time we had to decide who to fight next, it was an occasion for the were-raven, the were-vulture, and the were-dinosaur to bounce their oddball worldviews off each other.  I played the vulture.  He was a off-putting guy obsessed with his bizarre religious philosophy of natural death, and it was fun to inhabit him and explore him, and it was <i>especially</i> fun to elicit reactions to him.<br/><br/>If, instead of preparing combat missions for us, the GM had prepped to maximize PC-PC interactions and optimally reward princess play (or a tea party, if that's what you're calling that?), the game probably would have been better for it.  I wonder if tools for prepping that sort of thing are already out there, or if we should work on inventing some...<br/><br/>Eero, if you'd like to follow up on any of the questions you asked in your previous post, please feel free.

Yeah, but creative agenda being <i>expressed</i> as a group activity is not the same thing as it existing only as a social phenomenon. I know that Ron's traditionally against psychological explanations and likes to stick to socially observable phenomena, but for me it seems obvious and necessary that a communally expressed creative agenda only exists because it has psychological antecedents: the people engaging in this social behavior have internal lives that are somehow satisfied by this behavior. Or, in other words: a person has a "creative agenda" that can cohere with the creative agendas of other people via successful play.<br/><br/>We could use carefully separate terminology for the different logical forms that creative agenda takes, but traditionally it's just been called "creative agenda" being expressed in different ways. For example, we tend to say that a book has a creative agenda, although we don't really mean that the book is a group of people expressing empirical social cues - we just mean that the book in question contains instructions of play that are most functionally used in service of that specific creative agenda. Similarly we say that a person "has a creative agenda" despite that person not being a group of people expressing social cues - we simply mean that the person has the necessary psychological drive for potentially engaging in play that expresses that creative agenda.<br/><br/>I don't think that anybody's ever argued that creative agenda exists only as some sort of interpersonal thing that does not require psychological antecedents. At least the way I've understood Ron on this (he's the one most psychology-averse in theory terms, from what I've seen) is that he's unwilling to speculate about the specific psychological antecedents for methodological reasons, and due to his specific philosophy of science. He doesn't claim that you could take a bunch of lobotomy patients or zombies and get them to express a creative agenda, which would be the natural implication if creative agenda was not a psychological phenomenon as much as a social one.<br/><br/>Accepting that creative agenda has psychological underpinnings that we can speculate on, in the way psychology as a science generally speculates about the human mind, doesn't of course mean that I reject Ron's technical program - I agree with him about social expression being the only realistic means of observing creative agenda directly. We can talk about our introspective feelings regarding e.g. princess play, but we can't evaluate each other's internal state of mind; in practice you need to set up a real play environment and see if people respond to opportunities for engaging in princess play. If they do, well, apparently they do have a compatible creative agenda.

I absolutely agree. That's actually the major reason for why I even gave this type of play a name and started investigating it actively - there's a chance for a productive artistic program here, in figuring out whether princess play is common, enjoyable and something you would want to specifically design a game around. Considering focused and specialized princess play is an opportunity to create a new type of modern rpg design, you know?<br/><br/>The way I see it, historical traditional roleplaying texts have been endemically infested by princess play, but the support for it has been relatively covert. For example, games will generally advertise themselves as being for the purpose of roleplaying and having fun by being your character (princess play), but in practice the mainstream trad rpg has carried a heavy adventure gaming structuration that runs contrary to this promise. The notion of a D&amp;D gamer creating a boisterous character who runs into the dungeon, drops some flashlights on the way, and then dies is a historical constant: it was just as true last week for Hamnacb, last decade when it happened to a nice girl I was teaching to play challenge-based D&amp;D, and in the '80s when AD&amp;D 2nd edition was completely in the throes of confusion regarding whether the players are supposed to wargame or character play.<br/><br/>So I have this pet hypothesis that while princess play might not be as oppressed by the historical institution of traditional roleplaying as some other styles of play, it's not quite being dealt with honestly, either. We've brushed on the relevant attitudes earlier in the thread, in fact: it's easy for gamers to question whether something that doesn't ascribe to a goal-oriented adventuring program reminiscent of old school D&amp;D has value or is healthy. Is it good if we simply <i>let</i> a player goof off doing their princess stuff? Shouldn't there be challenge embedded here somewhere? Isn't it a masturbatory power fantasy if we (the plural GM here, hi) sit down, shut up and let the player perform their character for us? These are very traditional, very old questions, I think; I see them underlying theory discussion in the '80s already.<br/><br/>Something like that could explain why you don't see entire groups doing consistent princess play. I also believe that princess play is not the most natural <i>exclusive</i> focus for a game, so there's probably going to be other stuff going on as well alongside it - the GM's plot, for instance - but I also think that the vast majority of groups engaging in princess play probably don't view it as an intrinsic value. The way I've seen it, it's more something that people allow to exist. Compared to the GM's plot railroad the princessing is an entirely submissive activity: the GM's plot gets discussed as a theoretical concern, it gets prepped for, it gets goal-oriented structuration around it, it gets criticized and worked on. Meanwhile princessing is a voluntary part of your average simmy trad adventure campaign, something you're allowed to do if you feel like it - or maybe aren't, depending on the GM and whether you've understood timing correctly and so on.<br/><br/>I come back to <i>Ars Magica</i> often when thinking about princess play, as that game's naturally grown culture has an amazing amount of relatively honest princessing activity going on. The AM player base, as publicized at e.g. the publisher's forums, is quite overt about the idea that the player character is the player's long-term project, the player chooses what kinds of content their character engages in, and neither the rules nor the GM nor other players are allowed to break another player's toys unilaterally. The player-originating character building and decorating is consistently a major part of play, apparently more important than plot or wider setting for most campaigns. One could do worse than looking into how Ars Magica is played in the wild if one desires to see relatively intentional, pure princess play in action.                        </div>

Yeah, I can see what you mean. For me it's simpler because I sort of "discovered" princess play (not in any grand sense, it was right under my nose the whole time) by boiling down the general simmy broth of how trad games are generally played until I could perceive how the various components of play (Setting, Character, etc...) contributed to actually functional Sim play. I figured out how Plot usually works in Sim first, and then got other stuff down. Coming from this direction I simply realized at one point that hey, actually this D&amp;D thing where the dwarf player babbles about beer and beards is <i>exactly the same</i> as a little girl's princess play time in terms of actual creative motivation - I couldn't see a difference, which meant that either I didn't understand these people I was comparing, or the psychology really was the same. Further experimentation continues to support the notion that princess play is real, and that you can toggle it "on or off" intentionally in the same way you can choose to engage or disengage from other creative agenda opportunities.<br/><br/>So anyway, coming to this from that direction it was sort of obvious to me that what I'm looking at is a conjunction of a specific technique of play (having a role and pretending to be your role) and a specific creative agenda mode (Simulationism). There are clearly some other ways people do Sim with characters, though, so it's not as simple as declaring one of those substantially empty theory formulas ("Character + Simulationism equals Princessing!") and calling it done, but it seems to me that princess play is a really common creative agenda, to the extent that it's often the default answer when traditional gamers are asked to explain what roleplaying is and what's fun about it.

Yes, that totally sounds like princess play to me. As I've mentioned in passing a few times, I've had recent opportunity to play both traditional fantasy adventuring (homebrew fantasy heartbreaker) and <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, and I've totally been entertaining myself with princess play alongside a few other activities. Your Werewolf game sounds just like that, except you clearly had other players more consistently along for the ride. I can only assume that princessing gets more entertaining when the other players make the effort to provide you with sounding-boards, too, instead of it being just the GM who feeds new situations for you to react to.<br/><br/>And I'm not even certain if it's right to call that fleeting. I mean, what's the reward cycle for princessing? I suspect that it can be pretty short compared to some other things you end up doing in a rpg. There's a ramp-up period as you get to know your character and become comfortable "inhabiting" them, but after that it seems to me that you can get your kicks quite fine doing short skits for the most part. Of course it's great if the game can revolve more around your character now and then, too - you want your character focus episodes - but if you enjoy playing Wolverine, then you presumably already enjoy it when Wolverine gets one good scene of violence in now and then, and gets to be broody and non-communicative in social scenes on the way.<br/><br/>This comes back to my suspicion that it wouldn't even be very natural to try to fill in an entire game with nothing but princess play. Rather, my experience tends to be that the Sim engagements form an ensemble that you construct the game experience out of; they all generally harmonize well, so it's possible to have a campaign that has a bunch of mechanical build stuff, a GM's plot railroad maybe, some setting, some princess play... The question isn't so much whether a "pure" princessing game exists or could exist, but rather how you can make your princessing support reliable (whatever amount of princessing the game allows, it really does allow it instead of bait-and-switching), fun and efficient.<br/><br/>That being said, we have some games that do more princessing than your average trad game:<br/>Ars Magica<br/>Wushu (maybe? I haven't read it, but I can't imagine what else the point of play would be.)<br/>Chuubo's Mystery Engine (haven't played, heard interesting things)<br/>Fate, Exalted and similar neo-trad stuff<br/><br/>I could see some of those running on near pure princess power, really. For most of those the main reason to do something <i>else</i> is that they've got pretty nifty setting stuff or whatever to play with <i>as well</i>.                        </div>

Yes, the forum rpg freeform play has been total princess play whenever I've taken a look.<br/><br/>And yes, I totally guessed that that's where Emma is coming from.

I think that there's a lot of potential there. I sketched out something like that for Exalted in 2008 or so, in fact; the premise was that the GM would specifically pick and choose the wuxia combat engagements to showcase and progress the character issues the players choose to establish during chargen. The plot would be filled in a posteori based on what you'd need to do - just a little bit like how you'd GM <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, except with static character concepts instead of dynamic crunching. I can't really see why that wouldn't work, and you could easily do the same in something like Hero System or GURPS or Fate, too.<br/><br/>It is useful to remember and realize that the popular culture macro-trend in youth culture has swung pretty hard towards character-based entertainment over the last 20 years. If stuff like say shonen manga ("Here's a character with an interesting style. Now see character shout a lot. See plot come up with excuses for shouting a lot.") gets taken seriously as entertainment, then why wouldn't the same thing work in a roleplaying game? Us old farts are <i>obviously</i> fixated upon Big Plot because that's what Lord of the Rings (our entertainment of choice) does, but there are other approaches to the literary arts out there.                        </div>

In theory, yes. <br/>For my personal practice, not really, assuming you're talking about GM railroad (which I'm assuming you are, since your example talked about a GM). That's a product though of that in the playstyle my group and I use, there's no space for a GM. We don't do plots outside of the character arcs, and it's an essential tenet of our play that character arcs are completely player-authored, and completely player-controlled. We've had experiences playing GMed games in the past where the GM literally had nothing to do because the players were just doing everything. <br/>If you're talking player railroad as in players authoring plots in detail before play and then playing out those plotlines in detail (which there's a pretty valid argument to describing that as an unusual type of railroading), then heavily railroaded games are the entirety of what I play, and are the only type of play I enjoy.                        </div>

I actually pretty directly found princess play as a playstyle through wanting to emulate character-based entertainment. I've always found Big Plot stuff like LotR really boring, because it doesn't do anything that appeals to me. <br/>Whereas character-focused stuff, like the example you gave of shounen anime (although my tastes in anime are more in the realm of shoujo and josei than shounen, but there's a lot of related style as far as being deeply character-focused, and often shoujo and josei are even more character-focused) is exactly the sort of thing I'm into. <br/>In my roleplay, I've never been trying to emulate Lord of the Rings. I'm trying to emulate stuff like Revolutionary Girl Utena, Mawaru Penguindrum, Princess Tutu, Kino's Journey, Aoi Hana, My Neighbor Totoro, Flying Witch, Spirited Away, Yurikuma Arashi, Revue Starlight, etc. All of which realistically has absolutely nothing to do with the Big Plot kind of stuff like LotR. <br/>Even before I found CMWGE, that's the sort of stuff I've been trying to emulate in my play, and LotR is exactly the sort of thing I've been consciously trying to avoid. CMWGE just gave me better tools for emulating that stuff than other games I've tried it with in the past.                        </div>

                            Very good. I like your artistic program, Emma - sounds like a solid foundation combined with a coherent practice. It's rather more common to see people get swept away by the D&amp;D mainstream; three years later, and they find themselves drifting to the shore on a raft made of charops and gear options, wondering why their art has congealed into a bland elfdwarf soup served on an inch-by-inch gridiron [grin].                        </div>

                            Thanks Eero! ^_^<br/>tbh, back when I used to play DnD, we played it so strangely that I don't feel like anyone watching our sessions could have identified it as DnD without being told what game we were playing. We did pastoral slice-of-life in DnD 4e and only engaged with the combat mechanics for a tiny, tiny fraction of the time spent at the table, with combat being basically a minigame representing our characters working as mercenaries, which was their side job, with working in a shop as their main job - the one that was actually focused on in the story. It was realistically freeform with an infrequent combat minigame, which is I think likely one of the most unorthodox uses for DnD 4e imaginable. <br/>Which like, given that, and everything else about our practice, I think it's easy to see why we haven't used DnD in years. That period was definitely instrumental in developing our modern practice though, particularly in terms of realizing what kind of mechanics we don't want a game we're playing to have.                         </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> : Most GMless games can be thought of as GMful (everyone's a GM) with profit. Or, in a group of children or on a forum, you could find a power structure with at its end a GM without a hat.<br/>For Princess Play games, you can add Rêve,  which manages PP like this : very hard rails but the trains goes so slow, characters usually walk down the track, hopping on and off, and explore the country, every scenario a touring guide (culinary, botanic, alieutic, etc.) Skills for autonomy (foraging, crafting, "performance crafting") Resulting in immense freedom to engage this or that.<br/>Sometimes a very good or bad roll starts an adventure.                         </div>

                            Very interesting, thanks! That makes a lot of sense to me. (From both of you.)<br/><br/>I see a strong distinction between what Eero is describing and what Emma is describing, but perhaps they are just extreme poles of one activity. (After all, the creative input of a player coming up with their own plots and acting them out is very different from portraying a colourful personality within a larger plot where you are more or less a passenger, but there are a lot of similarities in terms of how you'd actually engage with the process of play and what you would enjoy as you were doing it.)                        </div>

                            I think it's definitely a thing of just being separate processes for the same thing, but I also think it's very much a product of what role a character plays in your head. <br/>Princess Play is very much about expressing the character as you envision them first and foremost, and that being (ideally) rewarded either by the game, the group, or both.<br/><br/>My practice is coming from a place of viewing character and character arc as inextricable. If I'm not able to play out my character's arc exactly the way I want, it's the same for me as if a GM's situation didn't allow me to express my character's personality. It's all a part of expression of character for me, since for me, character and character arc are inextricable, two halves of what makes up my mental mapping of what a character is.<br/>There's also a level where my practice has a level of translating railroading as it's used in more traditional PP into a GMless setting, and a translation of my views on writing stories, since for me, roleplaying is a type of collaborative fiction writing.<br/><br/>Whereas, I would presume (and he can correct me if I'm wrong) that Eero's practice of PP comes from a mental model of character where character and character arc aren't as tightly interlinked as they are in my mental model.<br/><br/>Both ways are character expression as the first and foremost goal of play. We just have different definitions of what a character is.                        </div>

                            That's really insightful, Emma. Thanks! Well said.<br/><br/>Eero, <br/><br/>What would it take to talk you into expounding a bit on your ideas of how the Five Elements of Exploration interact and serve functions in a Sim context?<br/><br/>It's interesting, because the basic or naive kind of "princess play" you've described earlier usually has fairly little to do with "plot" (however you want to do define that), but Emma's vision, here, is very tightly linked to the developments of the story. Similar dials could exist for other Elements of Exploration, I'd imagine; I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.                        </div>

                            As Emma says, the plot thing doesn't seem to me to be much more than a particular technical expression; the underlying psychological drive - the creative agenda - is the same, some games just deal with it differently. Insisting that princess play has to relate to plot in a certain way would be like insisting that squad-level tactical skirmish games all have to relate to set-piece combat encounter design the same way; it's simply not true, there are many design strategies that various schools of design use.

For those unfamiliar with Forgite theory jargon: the Five Elements are a generalized conceptual break-down of what happens in the simple act of roleplaying. The claim is that when you engage in a meaningful unit of play, your game will always feature Character, Setting, Situation, Color and System, and that these elements can be analytically separated from each other and observed in isolation to understand what essentially happens in the complex act of play.<br/><br/>It's a rather complex topic taken all at once like that; I've found concepts like "princess play" or "GM story hour" useful precisely because they are discrete technical clusters one can work with in the specific. I think that's part of why we've had all the conceptual trouble we've had with grasping Sim on an abstract level over the years. Sim overall, in general, is predicated on the idea that there is <i>something</i> in the Shared Imagined Space - in the fiction - that has human attention for the sake of the thing itself. What that something actually is gets strongly shaped and framed by our cultural understanding of what a "game" or "roleplaying game" is.<br/><br/>If you will, take this understanding/definition of Simulationistic psychology for a test drive: Sim play concerns ideation - inventing or reconstructing - of human-relevant concepts. The play process - the Exploration - exists for the sake of observing the ideas imagined by the players; it makes sense because the types of imaginary concepts involved in Sim play are generally intricate and cannot be properly observed in isolation. You only understand it by seeing it go, which is why you gather a bunch of people to simulate your ideas in various ways.<br/><br/>For example, a player interested in Wolverine - or masculine violence in general - will desire to play games that involve thorough scenarios that embed Wolverine in them, because this is a way to see Wolverine move and act. A still picture of Wolverine is a shallow understanding of the concept in comparison. A movie is better, or perhaps a video game. In the right circumstances, with the right kinds of ideas, a roleplaying game can be absolutely superior, as it enables the players to fine-tune the ideation in a way that would be impossible for less interactive and player-directed arts.<br/><br/>How this relates to the Elements of Exploration is that the ideas generally involved in Sim play do not form complete Exploration packages; they are rather literally individual elements of it. This means that there is room in Sim game design for different arrangements. Wolverine, for example, is a Character concept, with merely subtle requirements for the other Elements; while you cannot really meddle a lot with Wolverine without ruining the player's ideation, you have wide leeway with the other four Elements. Thus you can create many different games around Wolverine.<br/><br/>Other idea complexes are more expansive and thus more fixed. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> Sim, for instance, is a rather ritualized package: you get together a bunch of people who have childhood memories of playing D&amp;D, or who've watched a lot of Youtube shows about playing D&amp;D, or who are fans of the <i>Order of the Stick</i>, and then you provide them a simulation of the experience of playing D&amp;D. Everybody does what they're supposed to do, and the game goes like it's supposed to go. There's not a massive amount of leeway in how the Elements relate to each other, and what the Elements each have to be - not unless the players start taking individualized creative risks and breaking out of the simulation.<br/><br/><i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is similarly expansive as an idea: veteran roleplayers desiring to play CoC will generally expect certain types of Character, in a specific Setting, with the same Color they always have, and similar Situations... even the CoC System for all that it's horrible seems to retain a lot of nostalgia, probably because it's been such a central vehicle for the idea complex of "playing Call of Cthulhu" over the years.<br/><br/>In reality, though, these rpg-related examples of Simulationism in action are a bit of a cheat: they are self-referential cycles of roleplaying motivating people to ideate about roleplaying. Most Sim play, and most authentic Sim play, does not usually revolve around reenacting a full complex of ideas like that, because they're not roleplaying games reenacting roleplaying games. Rather, the typical way the creative concern in a Sim game seems to go is that you elevate one specific idea and build everything else in relation to that.<br/><br/>A <i>Star Trek</i> roleplaying game, for example, is a clear concept: the point of the exercise is to take the Setting idea of Star Trek and "make it go" by throwing in your own, basically arbitrary ideas about Character, Color, Situation and System in service to the idea of substantiating or demonstrating the Setting. That same game-playing activity often has room for other creatively relevant elements as well, of course: the Wolverine guy can bring Wolverine into the game (as a Klingon bridge officer, perhaps), for example, which is a value add collectively speaking: we get to see Star Trek in action, and we get to see Wolverine in action as well.<br/><br/>If we assume that an act of Exploration consists of the five Elements, and that Simmy ideation commonly exists for all five Elements (I believe this to be the case), then the theoretical "perfect" Sim game would be one where you select every Element to fit your own motivations: the Character we observe is one with great personal meaning to you, in a Setting you find interesting, with Color that delights you, a Situation full of intrigue from your viewpoint, and a System that highlights the most interesting things as far as you are concerned. Of course this sort of thing isn't normal; I'd rather say that you're doing well if the game elevates a single Element that is of interest to you, and selects the rest to conform to it.                        </div>

                            I don't really want to re-litigate the Big Model, but I feel like all the focus on Creative Agenda really made people ignore (at least in the popular discourse) the importance of other aspects of the Model. A lot of what defines certain styles of play and what makes them meaningful to people is NOT located in CA (probably the most clear and popular example is LARP, which is practically defined by Technique, even while divisions among different kinds of LARP often fall along obvious CA lines), and that's totally fine.<br/><br/>In particular, if you follow the line of thought that SIM doesn't <i>really</i> function as a CA the way GAM and NAR do, I've always felt that what SIM play is actually about is a focus on the various aspects of Exploration (something that's even more obvious when you see people trying to personally define Simulationism, or watch people argue about something like "immersion"); it's validating to see someone else say basically the same thing in a much more eloquent way than I ever could <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>

<b>Setting</b> is very important in that campaign. Prydain is vanilla high fantasy with Welsh - and more generally Celtic - mythology. Much of the canonical content the game concerns itself, the substantial topic of the game, is Setting context. The Setting is reproduced at the table through the GM story hour: there's predesigned plots and setpiece scenes, opportunities for the GM to talk about the setting and illustrate its facets. The players ask questions about it, rely on it, and make inferences to contribute.<br/><br/><b>Character</b> is second-most important: the players have D&amp;D backgrounds, video gaming backgrounds (that are D&amp;D backgrounds, really), and the 4th edition rules specifically ask them to pick a character class they like, and exemplify that in a heroic campaign. Their mission is to dwarf away (or Celtic champion away in this case, to be specific) as hard as they can. The high fantasy campaign structure enmeshes the players' chosen Characters into the plot to allow them to each substantiate their own type of heroism. Princess play abounds, obviously, as the players interact with the GM's story hour in the ways the 4th edition system facilitates.<br/><br/>There is a consistent creative interest in the specific <b>System</b> of miniatures skirmish combat in the campaign. It's an exploration of the style of play for me, and for most players. One might say that it's a perverse interest, even, as I don't think that I like it very much myself - it just happens to be something that the game and the campaign is built around, so I'm stuck running setpiece skirmish combats for the duration of this campaign. It's the concept, and some players seem to like it.<br/><br/>The campaign has specific <b>Color</b> and <b>Situation</b> trends as well, but I don't think that those carry much in the way of core creative purpose; we've just filled in those parts with accidental content that fits each player's whims. They're essentially negotiable variables that are fixed in relation to the more important bits. Whatever works goes in that regard, same as if it was a Nar or Gam game.<br/><br/>In summation, these are the core themes, the substantial Sim issues as they are experienced at the table:<br/><b>*</b> What does earnest vanilla high fantasy even look like, can we actually do that?<br/><b>*</b> This Celtic folklore and historical epic stuff is pretty cool, actually, when you interpret it for a modern audience.<br/><b>*</b> It sure is amusing to mix up D&amp;D tropes with this literary high fantasy YA stuff, there's a lot of ironic amusement in the blend.<br/><b>*</b> Modern story game pacing devises sure abound in 4th ed., the way this skill challenge frame paces storytelling is actually pretty neat.<br/><b>*</b> My character gets to give heroic speeches, have heartfelt moments with princesses and ride to battle against forces of evil. Fun!<br/><b>*</b> I have D&amp;D brain damage and I am therefore entertained by pretending to be an elf.<br/><b>*</b> It's cool to move miniatures on a board and roll dice, or so I heard.<br/> </div>

This is quickly becoming a general discussion of Big Model theory. Should be its own thread, properly speaking.<br/><br/>Your typical rpg plot railroad is substantially neither Situation or Setting, as I understand it; rather, it's merely a technical tool that is used to create, organize and convey either, both, or something else. Basically the existence of a plot railroad in the game is a System element saying that "in this game, the GM tells us what happens next." A game that doesn't have a fixed plot simply doesn't have the prepared GM plan for the order and content of play.<br/><br/>The reason that the plot itself is not an Element of Exploration is that the Exploration process properly is a relatively low-order social activity; Exploration as a concept doesn't refer to GM prep or the general sweep of play during a session, but rather to the smallest atomic process of activity by which the Shared Imagined Space changes. From this perspective the plot doesn't "exist" as a cohesive entity; there's simply a System conceit that assigns certain responsibilities for delivering Setting, Situation, Character and Color to different players, to be established in a certain way. In pre-plotted games whoever does the plotting is generally the one who delivers initial Situations. In a sense the "Exploration" is merely the stage on which the play happens, and the stage doesn't know or care about what happens back-stage: as long as every element combines in a functional way, so that Exploration manages to occur moment to moment, there's not much more to be said by merely observing the stage. Who knows where all this Situation is coming from?<br/><br/>Creative agenda works at a higher level of concern compared to the activity of Exploration; for agenda purposes we're not asking whether the SIS manages to change from moment to moment, but rather what purposeful plan that Exploration is following. In Sim play the purpose seems to be the presentation of substantial ideas on the stage of Exploration. The Elements of Exploration come into that only insofar that the ideas a player might wish to present on the stage of Exploration cannot appear there unless they are expressed by one of the Elements. If your creative concern cannot be expressed as Setting, Character, Situation, Color or System, then what is there to be done?<br/><br/>The canonical plot our Prydain campaign refers to, or any railroad plot in general, is a mechanism that helps us determine what the next Situation in play is going to be. In some other game the GM might ask the players "what does your character do next" in a strategic-level sense, and the answer would completely shape the itinerary of the game session; in this game the GM instead refers to his notes and tells the other players what the next scene is going to be, or at most offers the players a chance to jump to a different track.<br/><br/>The reason for why I don't analyze Situation as a major creative concern for the campaign is that in truth the actual situations the game moves through are relatively arbitrary, gaining their meaning by the way they showcase Setting and Character elements. This is partly due to the nature of the high fantasy epic: iconic situations simply aren't ultimately that important. Even climatic high points of the campaign like e.g. encountering the Horned King on the field of glory gain their significance not because they're canonically iconic (which this particular scene is not), but simply because they're major opportunities for revealing Setting or Character. In our campaign the combat encounter with the Horned King was the most intimate event the heroes ever got with the man/creature, and that opportunity to showcase the King's identity was why the scene was so important. That, and the miniatures skirmish combat related to it, which I did account for as a genuine Situation concern in my analysis.<br/><br/>A Sim game that had a true Situation focus would need to be less generalist about the plot... A wuxia game, for example, could have a specific creative concern over the conduct of swordfighting duels. The game would revolve around those. That would be what a Situation-based creative agenda would look like, more than what we're doing. Our Situation concern is overbearingly over whether a given scene is going to be a combat scene (implying battlemats and miniatures) or not, and that isn't even the most important thing going on most of the time.                        </div>

                            Thanks, Eero. Great to see how you conceptualize that campaign and its structure in Big Model terms. Also, a good example highlighting how System is at once the process which creates "plot" and also far broader at an actual table than just the ruleset in use. Good stuff.                        </div>
