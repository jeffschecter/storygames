As we Donkeys do every year, we will take part in the organization of <b>ModCon</b> (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="www.modcon.it" rel="nofollow">www.modcon.it</a>), the National Convention of Italian Gamers (attracting 4400 participants last year), that will be held in <b>Modena</b>, near Bologna and on the road to Milan, from <b>September 21st to 23rd, 2007</b>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our programme of activities, the 11th edition of the roleplaying contest \xe2\u20ac\u0153Teatro della Mente\xe2\u20ac\x9d is particularly worth of noting: starting back in 1997, every year our contest awards the best roleplayer and the best roleplaying authors with some nice Oscar-like statuettes (plastic statuettes, of course!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, we Donkeys will share with ModCon participants our usual harvest of roleplaying events: from indie RPG demos to storytelling sessions, from the most daring experimental games to larps in full costume. As always, all of our games will be played free of charge, and with the main purpose to involve the players in telling a good story together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year\xe2\u20ac\u2122s big news is the cooperation with the international roleplaying community. It is some years that the Flying Circus keeps an eye on the achievements of game designers from abroad, and we Donkeys import the best international larps and tabletop games to Italy. After the visit of our friends from the Scandinavian authors\xe2\u20ac\u2122 group \xe2\u20ac\u0153<i><b>Vi \xc3\xa5ker jeep</b></i>\xe2\u20ac\x9d at the latest Italian AmberCon in April, our network is in great expansion: we are inviting to ModCon our colleagues from the most interesting roleplaying scenes in the Nordic countries and in the rest of Europe, and with their help the Flying Circus is planning an <b>International Larp Symposium</b>, that of course stays open to tabletop game designers too. Our goals are presenting the best international authors and games (that will be translated into Italian) to ordinary ModCon participants; and offering a selection of the best Italian and European games in English to our guests from abroad. Moreover, a roundtable about roleplaying theory will be held, with the participation of some among the most influential theorists in Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what are you waiting for? Contact our officer for international guests Andrea Castellani (<a class="bbcode_email" href="mailto:andrea.castellani@gmail.com">andrea.castellani@gmail.com</a>), and welcome to ModCon 2007 from all the Donkeys in the Flying Circus!\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nI will be happy to answer any question about the ModCon in this thread or by PM, but I am not in the group of people who are organizing the convention, so for more specific information you should contact Andrea at <a class="bbcode_email" href="mailto:andrea.castellani@gmail.com">andrea.castellani@gmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI will attend the ModCon as a player (but I will GM some indie game, too), so if you intend to go there to present your game let me know about it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
