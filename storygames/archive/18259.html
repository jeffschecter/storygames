First post. I made this thread out of curiosity, since I have no plans to buy an RPG soon.<br/><br/>So. I'm playing Pathfinder (6 players + GM). And while I do find some things interesting... I find combat kinda boring. Yes, there's variety and it's not monotone, and I would have loved it 10 years ago, but now... it just doesn't have that spark for me. However, that's what the group is playing so that will be my RPG for the near future. (I don't hate it. I'm just not in love with it.)<br/><br/>I sometimes think about the concept of NVRPGs (NonViolent RPGs), but I'm not too knowledgeable regarding the RPG scene. From lurking I can recognize some RPGs -- Apocalypse World, Fiasco, etc. But my experience has been limited to Pathfinder. So if I try to come up with what I think is an NVRPG I draw a blank.<br/><br/>First question-- Can you list RPGs that are fun and have no violence? And I mean ZERO violence. Games with a "little violence" don't count. But, games where violence is entirely optional so that it can be fully sidestepped do count. BTW, horror genre is out no matter what.<br/><br/>Second question-- Have you (members of this forum) done some research towards NVRPGs or the like? I think it would be nice to set up a contest, maybe like that Chef contest, but geared towards development of NVRPGs or systems. What do you think of it?<br/><br/>Third question-- I've been lurking for a long time, and I remember at some point someone said that they had spent years having fun without combat. (Those weren't the exact words, just similar.) If you have experience with NVRPGs (lots or little), can you please describe your experiences?<br/><br/>A final note-- I don't post often but I'll be lurking. If I don't post it doesn't mean I've left, just that I'm not compelled to post yet. However, I will post if someone asks me to.<br/><br/>Thank you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411802/#Comment_411802" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-10T21:02:38+00:00" title="April 10, 2013  9:02PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2013 9:03PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer your question in short: yes.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.tao-games.com/?p=35" rel="nofollow">Clover</a> is about a five-year old girl and her friends.<br/><a href="http://celstyle.com/?p=233" rel="nofollow">GxB</a> is about high school dating.<br/><a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/bti.html" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice</a> is about adults dating.<br/><a href="http://tckroleplaying.com/marscolony/" rel="nofollow">Mars Colony</a> is about political crises on Mars.<br/><br/>I'm leaving off games where you can avoid violence with effort (Like Dogs in the Vineyard or Drifter's Escape), and trying to concentrate on games where violence is just not really the point at all.

As in other media, it can be played as light or dark. Emotional or social conflict is treated as a form of combat in some games (e.g. Burning Wheel) and can also be made light or dark. Imagine an RPG based on "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf".<br/><br/>What makes these get dark, it seems, is a recognition that conflicts can be pushed beyond limits and that people can be severely hurt. So, what if you had a game where the mechanics enforced that conflicts always have limits and that they always have to end in some kind of consensus. The obstacle becomes not dealing damage to an enemy until it succumbs, but finding a way to resolve the situation so everyone's satisfied. (Which could easily devolve into stalemate, but maybe the rules could have some way to avoid that?)<br/><br/>This sounds like it could become the ultimate clich\xe9 hippie game ("OK, so we're sitting in a circle with the goblins and sharing our feelings about how the speciesist culture we live in forces us into cycles of oppression\u2026") but if it avoided that it could be pretty cool.

I recognize the fetish for violence is still prevalent in commercial RPGs (cue the juvenile male audience they're mostly marketed to, or the older-but-nostalgic geek audience)\u2026 But, for a number of years, I've been playing mostly historical, science-fiction or relationship-focused games, where violence does happen sometimes but is not a primary focus of play. For some historical games, violence might shape a huge part of their background (I'm thinking i.e. <i><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/store/#19" rel="nofollow">Grey Ranks</a></i> or <i><a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/index.html" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a></i>), but murder still doesn't need happen on-screen frequently, or at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411820/#Comment_411820" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T01:41:52+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  1:41AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've designed a number of nonviolent games: <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/ribbon-drive/" rel="nofollow">Ribbon Drive</a>, <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/keep-it-sunny/" rel="nofollow">Keep It Sunny</a>, and some might argue <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/thequietyear/" rel="nofollow">The Quiet Year</a>.<br/><br/>Ben Lehman has written a number of nonviolent games: <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/?p=35" rel="nofollow">Clover</a>, <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=18784&amp;cat=0&amp;featured=Y" rel="nofollow">Hot Guys Making Out</a>, and <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/?p=25" rel="nofollow">On the Ecology of the Mud Dragon</a>.<br/><br/>Emily Care has written a number of nonviolent games: <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/bti.html" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice</a>, <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/stm.html" rel="nofollow">Shooting the Moon</a>, <a href="Under My Skin" rel="nofollow">Under My Skin</a>, and <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/sis.html" rel="nofollow">Sign in Stranger</a>.<br/><br/>Jackson Tegu has written a number of nonviolent games: <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/silver-and-white/" rel="nofollow">Silver &amp; White</a>, <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/passerine/anna-the-millers-daughter/" rel="nofollow">Anna the Miller's Daughter</a>, and <a href="http://www.photographsoflightning.com/bat-shit/slammin/" rel="nofollow">Slammin'</a>.

We need to reverse the polarity!) <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411830/#Comment_411830" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T05:54:05+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  5:54AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/a-penny-for-my-thoughts/" rel="nofollow">A Penny For My Thoughts</a><br/><a href="http://fairgame-rpgs.com/1001nights.html" rel="nofollow">1001 Nights</a> (main site is down)<br/><a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/MiseryBubblegum/" rel="nofollow">Misery Bubblegum</a> was quite a lovely game, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LionPeace" title="LionPeace"><img alt="LionPeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LionPeace">LionPeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411846/#Comment_411846" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-11T09:05:34+00:00" title="April 11, 2013  9:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My Question to the OP is are you looking for a game without combat, or without physical violence?</blockquote>I understand your point.
