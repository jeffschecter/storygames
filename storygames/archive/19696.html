Dice are rolled whenever the GM feels some PC action should prove to be a real and interesting challenge.  Challenges are prepped ahead, dungeon-style, for sandbox play, although they can also easily be created on the fly.  Tell me what you think about the mechanic.  I haven't seen anything like it yet to compare or test.<br/><br/>Please forgive the boring table; I encourage you to read on.  I think once you get past it, it will be intuitive.  But I must show it up front in order to best explain the mechanic in writing.<br/><br/><b>Chance Table (d20*)</b><br/>7. Fail only on a 1; or automatic success if the Guide feels failure isn't interesting<br/>6. Succeed on 5 or higher<br/>5. Succeed on 8 or higher<br/>4. Succeed on 11 or higher<br/>3. Succeed on 14 or higher  (<i>Very Challenging</i>)<br/>2. Succeed on 18 or higher  (<i>Brutally Challenging</i>)<br/>1. 20 is required to succeed (<i>Desperately Challenging</i>)<br/><br/>Every passive challenge is a challenge, brutal challenge, or desperate one.  This is if you imagine an average joe attempting it.  It's purely an abstract judgment call on the part of the GM.  It's also a nice shortcut explanation for players, when it seems that describing the situation in prose isn't getting the idea across.  You can always fall back on "Climbing this cliff appears as if it would be brutally challenging for a mortal." and let their imagination fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>As you can see, the probabilities for such challenges are set, above. That is if no appropriate advantages are brought to bear.<br/><br/>An adventurer can increase their chance of success by way of these increasing 4 Levels of Advantage:<br/>1. One advantage: Appropriate to the challenge<br/>2. Multiple advantages: Appropriate to the challenge<br/>3. Well-prepared: When some advantage addresses every disadvantage present in the challenge<br/>4. Masterfully-prepared: When perfectly suited advantages address every disadvantage present in the challenge (i.e. the disadvantages are all but bypassed)<br/><br/>Each level of advantage increases the PC's possibility for success of the Chance Table.  A level 3 advantage (well-prepared) in a desperate challenge results in level 4 on the Chance table (succeed on 11 or higher, or 50%)<br/><br/>Some notes before I give examples:<br/>- An advantage can be anything written down on the character sheet, in plain language.  The game features very few stats (only for some specific rules subsystems)<br/>- A disadvantage is something obvious in plain language, not a formal mechanic; this will make sense in the examples below<br/>- Someone could be well or even masterfully prepared with only 1 advantage.  These levels are not about the number of advantages, but how effectively they seem to address the situation at hand.  The two levels below assume that even with some advantages, the adventurer is still not quite well prepared<br/><br/><b>Examples</b><br/>There's a rock wall in one of the dungeon rooms that would be a challenge to climb, but will provide a good vantage point to notice a clue about a secret door elsewhere in the room.  Examples of advantages that might apply here: being dextrous, a rope, a grappling hook, spikes, having skill in climbing, being particularly lightweight, etc.  In this case, having a secured rope would count as being well-prepared.  A knotted rope, or having any climbing gear plus skill in climbing would count as being masterfully-prepared.<br/><br/>There's also a cave wall behind a waterfall that leads to a secret alcove with treasure inside.  Due to the running water and the height of the climb, this is a brutal challenge.  Similar advantages as above would apply here, although to be well-prepared one must have some way to account for the water, and have strength or stamina (or a way to rest during the climb) to account for the height.  To be masterfully prepared, one would need to all but negate the slipperiness from the water (like an ointment of friction).<br/><br/>Apologies for not taking extra time to write the examples in a more inspiring prose <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Any feedback, welcome<br/><br/>* I don't actually like the d20. I much prefer d6es or fate dice.  But it's hard to get the natural feeling probabilities I want with more complex rolls involving multiple dice.  Any suggestions in this area are especially welcome, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning" title="DustinDePenning"><img alt="DustinDePenning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DustinDePenning">DustinDePenning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437512/#Comment_437512" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-19T11:38:17+00:00" title="August 19, 2014 11:38AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sounds like a universal difficulty system which I've seen in a few RPGS. Your take is a different expression, though. <br/><br/>Examples:<br/><b>Apocalypse world</b><br/>Always the same difficulties on 7-9 or 10+, but penalties for failure are what the GM scales naturally. <br/><b>Synthicide</b><br/>This is an rpg I'm developing. Core mechanic is that the GM sets the difficulty of any action from 3 to 9 or much higher for crazy difficult things. Player rolls 1d10 + attribute to see if they succeed. Gm scales both the difficulties and the failure penalties based upon the situation. <br/><b>Degenesis</b><br/>This game has a unique mechanic. Players have a skill rating which is the highest they're allowed to roll in a situation. The GM also sets a difficulty which is the lowest they're allowed to roll. The player rolls 2d10, and tried to get the result somewhere in that window.<br/><b>Early UNNAMED RPG development stages</b><br/>Not sure if I can say the name of this rpg. It's out now with very different mechanics. Anyway, Everything was basically difficulty 15. And you only EVER rolled if your advantage level was the same as the challenge level. So it was a game of finagling team up bonuses and equipment/skill advantages so you either auto succeeded or matched the difficulty situation and rolled.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437516/#Comment_437516" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-19T13:07:01+00:00" title="August 19, 2014  1:07PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2014 1:07PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds usable to me.  I'd find it easier to communicate by dispensing with the table and just saying:\n<blockquote>Try to hit the target number.  You get +3 for each level of Advantage.<br/><br/>GM, a target of 14 is a Challenge, 17 is Brutal, and 20 is Desperate.</blockquote>\nI think that's exactly what you have, except that I've moved Brutal from 18 to 17 and super-easy from 1 to 2.<br/><br/>I've seen <i>tons</i> of systems with target numbers and default difficulties and bonuses for relevant stats or gear.  None handled them <i>exactly</i> this way, but the end result seems the same to me.<br/><br/>By far my favorite part of this system is the 4-tier breakdown of advantage/preparedness.  Rather than tallying a series of +2s or +3s from a discreet list of "things I can argue would help", the player knows that to get beyond the 2nd tier, they need something <i>perfect</i>.  And to get to 4th tier, they need specific prep.  I think I'd enjoy doing prep for an extra-special +4 levels (roughly +12 difficulty) guaranteed on the other end.  It'd also be fun when I have the perfect tool/skill for the job and that's another big plus.  And it'd be nice to curtail the sheet-searching at "2 things that can help" rather than reaching for every last possible aid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437520/#Comment_437520" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-19T14:06:51+00:00" title="August 19, 2014  2:06PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Yeah. +1 Dave.

Never mind the maths, but my three categories were cumulative rather than tiered (so not as innovative). The categories were: Skilled, Prepared, Motivated. (There was a fourth "luck" category but nevermind that). It worked pretty well. You could get one or several of them and they added up, but they were all binary, so you didn't differentiate between "pretty skilled" and "very skilled".<br/><br/>I like your take, though I'd worry slightly over the exact calls on what counts as what level. I always feel a bit uneasy when doing such calls, but that's largely play culture, and it helps that you have a GM doing it.<br/><br/>Do you take impairments (drunk, wounded, tired) into account? Can they knock you down a peg? Like "Yeah, you're masterfully-prepared, but you hardly slept all night, so I'm knocking you down to well-prepared unless you can score some coffee first." I guess that can count as one more obstacle you need to be prepared for, so \u2026 huh, I answered my own question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437662/#Comment_437662" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-23T11:31:02+00:00" title="August 23, 2014 11:31AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2014 11:32AM by Big_J_Money.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, exactly.  It shifts all positive (advantages) to the player's favor, regardless of the source, and all negatives (disadvantages) to be accounted for, regardless of source.<br/><br/>About the disadvantages, they are also to be factored into the GM's judgment about the difficulty level.  So in the case of being drunk, the GM simply asks himself "how hard would it be for a <i>drunk</i> average joe character to perform this action?"  The same is not true of advantages, which are used only as described above.<br/><br/>David, that's a tough call.  See, the 18 is calculated so that the difficulties are:<br/><br/>Desperately chalenging = 5%<br/>Brutally challenging = 15%<br/>Very challenging = 35%<br/><br/>I was equally tempted to do 5, 10, 35, but I can't accept 20% for that level, from my gamesman's perspective.<br/><br/>I might be able to make the use of table slightly cleaner though.  Difficulty Class, Class 1 being the most difficult (Desperate).<br/><br/>You add your character's advantage level to the base difficulty class to get your character's actual difficulty class.  Then consult the table.  The con here is having a table, but there are some pros:<br/><br/>- You're only ever adding 1-3 to 0-4 for a total result of 1-7<br/>- You don't have to multiply bonuses, i.e. how many +3's you get<br/>- The table is 1 - 7 and the only one players need to use, so it wouldn't take any longer to memorize than, say, what troop types score hits on what dice in Axis and Allies (anyone I've ever played A&amp;A with has that memorized by the end of the day).  And since 1 and 7 are especially easy to memorize, that really only leaves 2-6.<br/><br/>Notice I changed Challenging to Very Challenging.  I think this better represents the feel and odds I am going for, here.  This ties into the ethos of my game, which says that if something isn't very challenging, you shouldn't bother engaging the rules.<br/><br/>If someone wanted easier challenges, they might make a Class 4 challenge called simply "Challenging", which has 50% chance of success for an average joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
