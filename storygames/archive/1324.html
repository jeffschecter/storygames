                    Let me talk about the card game "Peanut Butter and Jelly."<br/><br/>There are two types of cards in the game ... some which are the components of your sandwiches (bread, peanut butter, jelly) and some which are meta-cards (flies to ruin other people's sandwiches, ants to steal ingredients).<br/><br/>You play an ingredient card, it starts a sandwich.  Immediately, people are thinking "I'd rather play a meta-card than an ingredient, because I can get stuff <i>plus</i> slow down my opposition."  But they're pretty much screwed, because there are way more ingredients than metas in the deck.  So occasionally they get a meta, but mostly people are just playing ingredients.<br/><br/>When you complete a sandwich you remove the cards from the deck, and keep them as a stacked sandwich.  Sorta like tricks in Bridge.<br/><br/>But ... <b>but</b> ... when you play a meta card, it goes back in the deck.<br/><br/>So there are three phases of the game:<br/><br/>First, the ingredients are prolific, and metas are rare.  Sandwiches are built.  Conflict is sporadic.  As more sandwiches are built we shift inevitably into ...<br/><br/>Second, the ingredients are getting scarcer, and metas are therefore more common.  Sandwiches are sabotaged left and right.  Conflict is rampant.  As sandwiches manage to get completed (often by the most rapid, brutal sequences) we shift inevitably into ...<br/><br/>Third, the ingredients are all but depleted.  The metas are now virtually useless, because there are not enough ingredients to give them power.  The game slides gently to a halt.<br/><br/>Now ain't that slick?  Doesn't that make you want to design a two-resource game?                </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>Very interesting, actually.  The question is, of course, whether this will reliably produce a well-paced story (at least that's the question in the context of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1323" rel="nofollow">that other thread</a>).

                            The general <i>math</i> of it looks pretty infinitely malleable, though.  If you have resource <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> which starts at N and drops by a point every minute, and resorce <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> which starts a zero and rises by a point every minute, and they synergize such that the conflict at a given moment is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> times <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> then you get (at minute X) a conflict level of (N*X - X*X), which is a nice inverted parabola that looks <b>a whole lot</b> like curves of rising and falling action.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>I agree.  This very, very much appeals to my mathematical and game-y sides.  This is very clever stuff.<br/><br/>The problem, for me, comes when I try to apply it.  What do these cards look like in actual play?  I'm not sure just how broad/narrow these things are.  I have absolutely no idea what even goes on the cards.  At the moment I'm going to put this down to the newness of the idea, but basically I can't seem to fit any of my internal models for story elements and their interactions except for the most broad (conflict, exposition, etc.) around this mechanic.  And, as the pirate said, it's drivin' me nuts.<br/><br/>I was sort of hoping you had some more specific ideas... do you? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I don't know if this is still relevant or not.  Or even if there is enough here to carry forward, but it strikes me with that a playing card based mechanic that discards red card after use but recycles black cards (or vice versa) could lead to a similar sort of pacing.  "When you are out of Red Cards, the game/session/story is over."<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>

                            Hmm, for what's worth, look at my "Mexican Standoff". Stealing a turn or contradicting someone's statement simply passes the currency (tokens) around. Blocking a BANG! <i>removes</i> currency from the game. What happens is that at first, when tokens are plentiful, people are much more free to interrupt and swing their gun around. But as resources diminish, people get much more edgey, and start playing more attention to where everyone's gun is pointing. Thus the dynamic of the game changes as play progressives.                        </div>

                            Hi, Tony.<br/>
<br/>
Your PB&amp;J game looks like Kill Doctor Lucky and Before I Kill you Mr. Bond/Renamed Spy Game. One of the problems that comes up is that while it DOES produce rising action and a climax in play, we often don't realize that the climax has hit until it's over. I'm just foreseeing the possibility of "Oh, I guess that sandwich I made 2 turns ago was the last sandwich anyone could make. I guess that was the climactic sandwich. Shucks, I had a cool idea I was holding for the climax."<br/>
<br/>
Not an insurmountable problem, just one to be aware of.                        </div>

                            Heh.  When I saw that Michael posted here, I thought for sure he was going to talk about story arcs in <i>With Great Power</i> which I was thinking about last night.  The fact that the mechanics shift power dynamics as play progresses is a cool model for shaping story development.  The problem I see is that WGP still relies on players for pacing, but that's probably not an insurmountable problem...<br><br>Thomas                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi!<br>
  I know I might sond like a broken record. But, check out ...in spaaace!<br>
http://www.gregstolze.com/inSpaaace.zip<br/>
Basically, there is a limited number of tokens<br/>
When there is a conflict, one player gets to narrate, the other player gets the narrator's token.<br/>
In this game, there is a GM. and he uses the same tokens. So, the ideal strategy is to let the GM have his way, narrate his little hart out and in the end triumph withn your awesome tokenousity!<br/>
But, even better, the payer has the choice. they spend the tokens when it matters to them.<br/>
So, I think this is the perfect combo of encouraging a climax without forcing the situation...<br/>

                            I was thinking about a game wherein you draw a hand of cards, then are trading to ceate sets (kinda similar to the PB&amp;J game).  Initially, though, you can trad with some non-player entity (entirely rules governed, like the Bank in Monopoly), but as you go on in the game, trading with the Bank increases in cost: you get fewer and fewer cards each time you give the Bank some cards.  Whereas trading with other players stays a constant cost, slightly above the initial Bank trading cost.  so as the game goes on, you see a shift from no player interaction to player cooperation.  <br/><br/>For an RPG, you declare that  trading with the bank requires your character to work against the other ones, or piss them off somehow.  Then trading with another player requires your characters cooperating.  This means the different cycles of the game equate to an initial stage where the PCs bicker among each other, then start cooperating as other threats take priority.  Like how many family dramas and ensemble television shows work.  See how in The Incredibles, each character starts out annoying the other characters in various ways, but then they come together in the end? Like that.<br/><br/>If you want, add a final competitive end state to the game, wherein only one player wins (or one loses), meaning player cooperation naturally breaks down as you approach the end.                        </div>

                            While the sandwich game is very cool, I've found that -- oddly enough -- narrative story arcs can be created/replicated by simply using a depleting pool of points. As long as players are familiar with the odds, it's clear to everyone when "the big moment" is and when it's over.<br/>

                            Luke:  I get how that generates the falling tail end of the curve.  What (in that pool system) generates the initial, "slow buildup" part of the curve?                        </div>

                            I've always liked the tension mechanic used in the Weakest Link. Each player takes turns answering one question at a time. Each correct answer is worth more money than the last, but is also more difficult. You can choose to "bank" when it's your turn, but that reverts the worth of the subsequent questions back to their lowest levels so you have to climb all the way back up again.<br><br>Translating this to a storygame:
<blockquote>Let's say you have set up stakes for a scene.<br/><br/>There is a singular, valuable resource. As you play out a scene, this resource builds up. This is good, you want that sweet, sweet resource. Even better, the rate of resource growth doubles every time. One, two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and so on.<br/><br/>The snag is that the more resource a scene is worth, the more likely it is that the scene won't be resolved on your terms. <br/><br/>You can choose to "bank" if you want. This represents a climax to the scene, appropriate for the amount of resource that the scene was worth. Congrats, the scene then resolves on your terms. The group as a whole collects that delicious resource and it's another player's turn to have a time in the spotlight.<br/><br/>If you "break," by failing a roll, wager, etc., then the scene is not resolved on your terms. The accumulated resources of the scene evaporate into the ether. </blockquote>
This seems to model an "accelerating buildup with sudden drop" form of storytelling, which might be suitable for cinematic games with very quick scenes.                        </br></br></div>

                            This has been used to create tensions in duels in Legend of the Five rings.<br/>
<br/>
He who strikes first, strikes first, but the longer you wait the higher the damage. But who breaks first.<br/>
<br/>
If you imagine that certain actions by the players gives the GM a pool of points. When this pool reaches certain levels (Points of no Return) the GM can "buy" either upgrades to the faceless badguys, complicate the situation or change the environment. In other words each Point of no Return lets the GM escalate the situation and this taxes the players resources harder. Forcing them to make tougher choices to get more resources in turn until they eventually choose to resolve their keys/kickers/Beliefs whatever and then you have your climax.<br/>
You'd need a resource systems that rewards dealing with character issues based on the level of trouble it causes them. Keys seem perfect for this.                        </div>
