PCs would be people with positions of importance, not just random freebooters (though one could be a condottieri captain or something).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat system would you recommend for this kind of game?  I've seen the beta version of Principia, and I will probably steal a few things from it, but I'm looking for something a bit different, maybe a little crunchier.  I'm curious about Reign because of its Company mechanics... it would be cool to have a way of modeling PCs being part of a noble family with various assets and holdings and so forth.  Other systems I've thought about stealing from are Mage: The Sorcerer's Crusade, TSoY, Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not averse doing some light design work/hacking, not to mention research.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my first post to Story Games, by the by, so hi, everyone.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317936/#Comment_317936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-27T20:02:22+00:00" title="March 27, 2011  8:02PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not hugely helpful since it's impossible to find, but if you're not averse to downloading out of print games that aren't even available on ebay - Castle Falkenstein.<br/><br/>The Riddle of Steel is also worth a look, also out of print, but not quite so hard to find as Castle Falkenstein.<br/><br/>Based on what you're thinking about with Reign and Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies, I'd suggest Legends of Anglerre.

No matter what system I use, I'd probably get really fussy with magic system and try to base something on my readings in Frances Yates and Ioan Coulianu.  Then again, I wouldn't be totally opposed to there being vampires and things like that in the setting, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nLegends of Anglerre sounds really interesting, the organization mechanics sound great.  It'd be nice to stat up organizations like the Medici and Sforza families, not to mention the Church.  I hadn't considered using FATE, since I've only read (not played) SotC.

The system thrives on rich settings that encourage hacking together various subsystems (alchemy, astrology, condottieri warfare, passionate art, etc.). The system is especially good for doing weird, non-rpg-like magic systems. The notion of having the characters in positions of power and with preloaded, character-rooted interests is also basic to SS. A GM willing to put in a bit of work combined with these ingredients seems like a recipe made for success.<br/><br/>In comparison, I'd only go for a FATE variant if there will be some overall campaign framework that defines the relationships of the characters to each other and clearly outlines a plot arc for what's going to happen in play: basically, does Charlie have a mission for his angels or not? Also, clear character identities: Solar System thrives on diffuse identities and uncertainty, while FATE needs to define and measure identities to express them powerfully. So Solar System for organic drama where nobody knows where it'll end up, and FATE for an action adventure with bad guys and good guys and McGuffins. HBO series vs. traditional adventure TV, basically, and all with Fudge dice.<br/><br/>Reign would work along the same lines as FATE. Riddle of Steel would also be good, but it's a complete package, and one that might not be ideal for a non-martial game in this setting; I wouldn't play a noblewoman or such in RoS without considering the matter carefully, for example, and this premise seems like it absolutely needs a character mix that's a bit more varied than 3-4 rough-and-ready condottieri (read: adventurers) messing about in Florence would be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317966/#Comment_317966" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-28T08:58:31+00:00" title="March 28, 2011  8:58AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.conspiracyofshadows.com/" rel="nofollow">Conspiracy of Shadows</a> would work.

I'm curious, though: what is it specifically about TSoY/SS as a system that makes it more suited to organic, HBO-series drama, as opposed to FATE relying on more of a traditional structure?  Is it just the fact that FATE characters have all those Aspects, requiring them to be more clearly defined from the beginning, or is there something else that I am missing?  I re-read the rules for TSoY last night and it seems like it would indeed work fine for the game I want to run, but then again I haven't actually played it before.

FATE (in the applications I've seen, anyway) defines characters as thematic declarations: this character is heroic in these ways, which translates into this sort of color in how he seems and what he does, and all this is in perfect harmony with what he is about - it has to be, for the player chose this when designing the character, and he did it with an eye towards emphasizing the character's nature. The character is basically an exclamation mark in Spirit of the Century (the flavour of FATE I know best), with its set of skills and stunts being the sentence its exclaiming.<br/><br/>In comparison, Solar System characters are question marks: the character is not built of strengths and color like in FATE, but rather of setting-based issues and internal insecurities. The two significant choices in TSoY chargen are the choice of character culture and the choice of character Keys; the former is open-ended and inherently in dramatic tension due to how the setting is built to involve immediately relevant dramatic issues for merely having a national identity, while the Keys are likewise dramatically dynamic due to how they forefront character issues in the form of questions, not statements. Having a "Key of Love" in Solar System is not a declaration of character identity, but a question about the same, waiting for an answer.<br/><br/>Considering the above, it naturally follows that FATE fits best in games where character nature is not an <i>issue</i>, but rather a <i>topic</i>: you do not explore character nature, for you already have a strong internal vision of what your character is like. The rules provide the tools for expressing that nature via Aspects and such; in practical play this expression happens via an action adventure story that allows the characters to prove their mettle. SS is the opposite in almost every regard: we are uncertain about what these question mark characters want and who they are, and therefore we focus on scenes that help us discover these things. The tools provided by the game, such as Key buyoffs, Pool refreshes and stakes negotiations support this.<br/><br/>Regarding your TSoY questions, have you read <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/" rel="nofollow">my take on the game</a>? I'm asking because some people have found my Solar System text useful in grogging the facets you mention, player-drivenness and such. The World of Near sourcebook (also available at that same address, although the HTMLzation is not as clean) also discusses some ways of doing organizations and all sorts of other stuff that might be useful for renaissance Italy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318168/#Comment_318168" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T10:10:14+00:00" title="March 30, 2011 10:10AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The default setting is close to the time period you're looking for, so I'd second <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel</a>.  A small number of players and the level of magic you're desiring should not be a problem.<br/><br/>The Riddle of Steel would be a good fit, too, but it's hard to find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318347/#Comment_318347" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-31T22:03:59+00:00" title="March 31, 2011 10:03PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all your input, everyone.  I'm leaning toward TSOY/Solar System at this point, though I'm sure there are any number of systems that would work well for a Renaissance game.  Eero, I've read through some of your Solar System document now and it was very helpful.  Thanks for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm starting to play around with the Pools, Abilities, Secrets, and Keys now.  Fun stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther RPGs will doubtless be looted for cool ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318358/#Comment_318358" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-01T06:32:29+00:00" title="April  1, 2011  6:32AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to add to the list of games that almost get you what you want, you might want to check out Pantheon Press's <a href="http://www.pantheonpress.com/fortunes_fool/whats_is_fortunes_fool" rel="nofollow">Fortune's Fool</a>.<br/><br/>It's Renaissance, it's got intrigue, it uses tarot cards in some fairly neat ways to resolve things. It's chockful of the flavor you're looking for.<br/><br/>It has magic, but as I recall, the magic isn't over the top and fits the setting like a glove. (It's been a while since I played, but I believe my character new Latin and that gave him the leg up in a sword fight with some sort of undead.)<br/><br/>It does have fantasy races, which might not be exactly what you're looking for. And by default, I don't believe the characters start off with positions of importance. I could be wrong there. And if you want a robustly player-driven story, you might have to bring some other tools to the table.<br/><br/>Definitely worth checking out. And if you have more questions about the game, I highly recommend contacting Pantheon Press. They're the friendliest bunch of dudes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JayStratton" title="JayStratton"><img alt="JayStratton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JayStratton">JayStratton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318661/#Comment_318661" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T07:17:19+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  7:17AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the shoutout Epi!<br/>\nI am one of the writers for Pantheon Press and we are pretty proud of Fortune's Fool.<br/>\n<br/>\ncscordy, if you want I could send you a PDF to look over.<br/>\nIf you like it and think it might be a good tool for you, then you can order a hardcopy.<br/>\nLet me know                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
