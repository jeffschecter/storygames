In game this happened: the PCs were fighting a bunch of cloaking advanced humanoids (like Predators but bigger wusses) and there was an engagement in this area full of rock pillars. The bugs were all hanging from the pillars and Bob says, "I want to fire a flare up and blind them."<br/><br/>It sounds maybe like an FA action but it's not using a weapon. Sounds like an NFA action too, but if so it has no mechanical affect whatsoever. How would you handle this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165577/#Comment_165577" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T05:25:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  5:25AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NFA, and give a bonus to their next roll or some other actual mechanical effect as a reward.

No way, no how. It's not fighting.<br/><br/>Lighting a flare and bashing them to death with it in hand-to-hand combat is fighting. Firing a flare into them to kill them would be fighting too. Using a flare to set yourself aflame and then bear-hugging the bugs is fighting.<br/><br/>But firing a flare up is a good use of NFA. Remember, you want to roll higher than the aliens if you want to avoid being killed. Sometimes it's better if you're rolling on NFA to do that. And if you succeed (even if you take a kill doing so) the fictional NFA thing is going to happen.<br/><br/>Generally, as a GM, I don't give them +1s for NFA in combat. Unless they are directly setting up something cute for their next turn. So, hey, I smash open the canisters of rocket fuel and try to douse many aliens in it... and you know the guy wants to switch to his Flame-Gun for next turn... if he succeeds on NFA he'll change range, switch to the flamer and look ta me for +1 since the bugs are all ready to toast!<br/><br/>I do give out the +1s more readily when the PCs set up an ambush or take care in doing stuff between encounters. (And, hey, Paul Riddle even let us kill some aliens when we poisoned their water supply using NFA, ho ho ho)<br/><br/>I imagine that in combat you'll also want to use NFA to rescue hostages or grab stuff that's in your mission briefing (grab as many eggs as you can and return them to base intact...).<br/><br/>Anyway, Fighting use FA, if it's not fighting then use NFA. The list of NFA stuff in the book includes things that folks will try to argue into FA, but is not actually fighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165606/#Comment_165606" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T06:39:21+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  6:39AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How long do all of your combats generally run?<br/>\n<br/>\nI played 4 games at Gencon and combat generally never lasted more than 2-3 rounds.

If you do a cool thing, make your NFA check and act before your ally, you can pass a +1 to someone in the same round. This turned failure into success a few times. If you don't act before your allies, you can still give the +1, but it applies to the next round.<br/><br/>But, usually, it's better not to describe too much of your action before everyone rolls.

On p. 75 it says "Wheeler was using NFA to change range and makes his way from the graves into the forest.  He's now at Near Range and switches to his Heavy MG."<br/><br/>I suppose I'm thinking that combining possible actions like this encourages use of NFA in combat- if a player has to decide whether to spend a round switching weapons or just firing their rifle, again, they're likely to go for the kills.  However, if they can change range and weapon in one roll, they might get more creative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167211/#Comment_167211" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T07:03:42+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  7:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's how I read it: each time you succeed in an NFA roll in combat you can ALSO, if you want, change weapon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167227/#Comment_167227" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T08:42:13+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  8:42AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2008 8:42AM by Gregor Hutton.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you use NFA to save an injured trooper drowning in a puddle, say, then you can also change range and switch weapon if you succeed. Of course, you might also take a Kill while doing it and saving the injured trooper doesn't remove any Threat from the encounter. Still, your odds with rolling NFA might be better than rolling on FA.<br/><br/>Malcolm spent most of Tuesday night running into the enemy camp looking for info, saving other troopers, and finding somewhere to hide, all using NFA, rather than fighting the enemy. It can be a good tactic for survival BUT it doesn't remove any Threat Tokens. Still, it is a valid option if you have a good NFA and want to achieve stuff in the fiction.<br/><br/>Oh, note that you always can change range if you succeed on NFA. So, say you are at Near and are using NFA ... if the Aliens kill you and move you to Close, then you can still move back to Near on your turn. If you rolled higher than the Aliens then you can move to Close or Far (or stay at Near) and don't get killed.

In most cases I will find it believable for them to switch weapons and move range along with some fictional event. Some fictional stuff might take several NFA successes to achieve of course and you might have to move to Close Range to be in the enemy command bunker, or whatever.<br/><br/>If someone is trying to do "too much" by the group's reckoning then that all gets sorted out at the declaration stage. What are you trying to do? Can you attempt that? Do we disbelieve!?<br/><br/>How it actually turns out will depend on the dice roll.<br/><br/>In Malc's case he was at Near Range and a guy was drowning in a pool of muddy water (he'd been hit by a Puddle Grenade -- turned the ground underneath him into quickmud) and so Malc tried to save him. Both Malc and the aliens succeeded, with the aliens rolling highest. So, Malc got Killed and got moved to Close Range, but he also saved Corporal Rommell from the puddle on his turn. Had Malc rolled higher then he wouldn't have got killed and he optionally could have chosen for the aliens to Close on him or for the battle to move further away and for him to now be at Far.<br/><br/>I think Malc was a bit surprised, and pleased, at how much "story" stuff he got to do in combat using NFA -- and have it mesh with the mechanical stuff like range. Of course it was leaving Pooka and Per to remove the Threat Tokens between them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167266/#Comment_167266" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T11:56:03+00:00" title="September  5, 2008 11:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, definitely a good clarification. <br/><br/>I was on the same page as Steve at first, until a comment made elsewhere made me realize you could change a weapon and do something else, such as changing range or adding a +1 to your FA for the next round through some action or other. I also made the call that you could change range IF you beat the aliens roll on a successful NFA. <br/><br/>What I wasn't tracking was that you could do all of the following:<br/><br/>1. Find a good cover position to fire from (providing a +1 FA on your next round's attack)<br/>2. Change Range to Near<br/>3. Change weapon to Energy Rifle. <br/><br/>Fictionally, it all seems quite possible. I'm moving to a position that is optimal to shoot, so moving range is easy to assume, as is adding a bonus to shoot. While moving, I'm tucking my grenade back into it's pouch and unslinging my rifle. <br/><br/>It's good to know that the rules support this, which I didn't think they did. <br/><br/>NFA in combat just got a bit better.<br/><br/>So, for one last bit of clarification, it's unlike to be possible to: <br/><br/>1. Add +1 to FA for the next attack<br/>2. Change Range<br/>3. Change Weapon<br/>4. Rescue civilian dude (or some other non-combat action that isn't directly preparing for future combat actions)<br/><br/><br/>Also, a thought that occurred to me during the last game, but I forgot to mention: Is it possible to "aim" over multiple rounds with NFA rolls and cumulatively add to FA? It seems like it might be, but it also seems a little cheesy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167270/#Comment_167270" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T12:15:28+00:00" title="September  5, 2008 12:15PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that last thing with 4 things would be too much to ask for me. But if it sounded really plausible at the time (and with a charismatic player!) who knows? I might let it live. Say, the +1 was dowsing the aliens in rocket fuel from his jump-pack while flying over the aliens with a rescued hostage or something? Switching from sidearm (hey, I just plain DROP it and grab my Flamer) ... umm, but still maybe too much going on?<br/><br/>Some groups will just insist that you can do one thing only when the bullets are flying and that is the best answer for that group.<br/><br/>For bonuses... I'd say they only go to the next round (but that's just my view). So, you get a +1 to the next round, which might help you get a +1 again in the next round but doesn't lead to a +2 ever. Of course, if you roll lower than the aliens you get killed while trying to hold on to your +1 over multiple rounds of aiming?!<br/><br/>Oh, that fictional stuff of "I'm moving to a position that is optimal to shoot, so moving range is easy to assume, as is adding a bonus to shoot. While moving, I'm tucking my grenade back into it's pouch and unslinging my rifle." is exactly how I see it. One of the playtest groups had a player who was ex-USMC -- he loved how the abstract combat left it up to his know-how to describe what was going on. He thought that was better than trying to list possible actions with individual rules and effects.
